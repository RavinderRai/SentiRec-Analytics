    "engadget = ['Sony nearly did it again. The company has dominated both over-ear and true wireless product categories for the last few years. It has a knack for creating a compelling combination of sound quality, noise cancelling performance, customization and features. None of the competition comes close to what the WF-1000XM4 offers in terms of what the earbuds can do for you automatically with features like Adaptive Sound Control and Speak-to-Chat. These are almost the complete package, if only the new ear tips offered a better fit. Even the best of the three pairs included in the box never felt truly comfortable. I only found relief when I grabbed the silicone tips from the M3 instead, and most people won’t have access to those. It seems so simple, but if you mess it up, a basic thing like ear tips can nearly ruin otherwise stellar earbuds. The WF-1000XM4 is available now in black and silver color options for $280.',\n",
    "            'I’ve said a set of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds are its best yet before – more than once. That’s because the company continues to improve its formula with each subsequent release, whether that’s the regular Buds or the Buds Pro. And now I have to declare it again. The Buds 2 Pro are a huge leap from the 2021 Pro model, with massive improvements to the audio, notable gains in noise cancellation and the introduction of several new features. Samsung lets its loyal customers unlock the best of the Buds 2 Pro, the same way Apple and Google have done. That’s not likely to change, but Samsung is making a strong case for owners of its phones to invest in its audio products too.',\n",
    "            '',\n",
    "            'If it’s supreme noise blocking you’re looking for in your next set of true wireless earbuds, the QCE II is the choice. With the updates Bose delivers here with the help of CustomTune, not only is the ANC noticeably better than the previous model, but overall audio quality and ambient sound mode are also improved. Sure, I’d like more than six hours of battery life and conveniences like multipoint connectivity and wireless charging should be standard fare at this point. For $299, I’d expect some of those basics to be included and Bose passed on them.',\n",
    "            'Bose has come a long way since the SoundSport Free. The company had years to perfect its next set(s) of true wireless earbuds, and it’s created a tempting package. The QuietComfort Earbuds have powerful ANC and great overall sound quality, plus premium features like wireless charging. The limited customization and touch controls could be a headache for some, and the large-sized buds create a look some may not want. And when you factor in price, Sony’s WF-1000XM3 is an attractive alternative despite its age. Bose and Sony have done battle over noise-cancelling headphones during the last few years, now they’re doing the same for true wireless earbuds. And Bose finally has a product that can give Sony a run for its money.',\n",
    "            'If you’re looking for the best of what AirPods has to offer in earbuds that don’t have the polarizing stick apparatus, the Beats Fit Pro should do the trick. They offer a nice blend of features, sound and noise-cancelling performance for the price. Sure, there are better options but they also cost significantly more, especially if you’re looking for the absolute best audio quality. For now, Beats is giving the masses an AirPods alternative that’s actually still packed with Apple tech. And that’s an interesting proposition for iPhone owners.',\n",
    "            'Apple’s noise-canceling earbuds were way overdue for an update. While the company didn’t see the need to change the overall design, it did extensive upgrades on the inside, introducing new features and improving performance along the way. Importantly, it made all of these changes while keeping the price at $249. Things like improved audio, more powerful ANC, Adaptive Transparency and even the upgrades to the charging case make the new AirPods Pro a worthwhile update to a familiar formula. Let’s just hope we don’t have to wait another three years for a full redesign.',\n",
    "            'Sony largely succeeded at what it set out to do: It built a set of true wireless earbuds that offers transparent audio by design rather than relying on microphones to pipe in ambient sound. Indeed, the LinkBuds blend your music, podcasts or videos with whatever is going on around you. There are certainly benefits for this, whether it be the ability to be less of a jerk in the office or to stay safe outdoors. Even with all of the handy tech Sony packs in, earbuds need to be comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time, and the area around the unique ring-shaped drivers is simply too hard to be accommodating. Consistent audio performance would make a big difference, too. For now, the LinkBuds are an interesting product that could be more compelling with some refinements. Hopefully Sony will do just that, because I’m very much looking forward to version 2.0. The LinkBuds are available to order today from Amazon and Best Buy in grey and white color options for $180.',\n",
    "            '',\n",
    "            'Google’s best earbuds yet are also its most complete package thus far. All of the features that made 2020’s redesigned Pixel Buds and the A-Series follow-up such compelling options for Android users, especially Pixel owners, are back. And while the Pixel Buds Pro are $20 more than what we got two years ago, the 2022 version is much improved. Active noise cancellation and the refined sound quality are equally impressive, and well worth the extra money. As long as Google can deliver spatial audio quickly and it works well, the only thing lacking is call quality, which may not be a dealbreaker for you.',\n",
    "            '',\n",
    "            '',\n",
    "            '',\n",
    "            'With the WF-1000XM5, Sony improves its already formidable mix of great sound, effective ANC and handy features. These earbuds are undoubtedly the company’s best and most comfortable design in its premium model so far, which was one of the few remaining riddles Sony needed to solve. For all of the company’s ability to add so many features, many of them still need fine-tuning, but that doesn’t make them any less useful in their current state. The WF-1000XM5 are more expensive too, which means the competition has one key area it can beat Sony. As is typically the case, there aren’t many flaws with the company’s latest model and its rivals still have their work cut out for them. The WF-1000XM5 are available for pre-order now in black and silver color options for $300. According to Amazon, the earbuds will ship on August 4th.',\n",

       "\"The new beats fit pro noise cancelling earbuds come in four color options .<n>The earhook gives you a feeling of security that your buds aren't going to fall off your head .<n>What's interesting with the fit pro is that the wing tip has been .integrated into the design it's one size fits all you can't replace it as far as i can tell but it does seem durable .<n>Because it's an extension of the sport fin it is a soft to the touch finish and a little bit of a grip to it use it to control music playback answer and end calls .<n>A long press switches between noise canceling and transparency modes you can also program the long press to be volume controls on the buds themselves .The case for the fit pro isn't as small as the airpods pro case or even the beats studio buds case but it's still pretty compact and much smaller .<n>The case charges via usbc not lightning however it's missing the wireless charging found in the airpods pro and airpods 3 cases .beats studio buds don't have apple's h1 chip so they're missing things like adaptive eq .<n>The fit pro have the same features as the airpods pro .The beats sound will impress you a lot it's good and these avoid distorting at higher volumes which probably has as much to do with the adaptive eq as the drivers themselves .<n>The base packs a little more punching goes a little deeper they have a pretty wide sound stage but they don't offer quite as expansive or refined sound as the more expensive wf-1000x buds .sennheiser tips create a perfect seal in my ears with these earbuds to be clear the beats tips fit my ears well .<n>i'm looking for the perfect fit when i test bud so i can get the optimal performance for sound quality as well as noise cancelling which can suffer if you don't get a tight seal .<n>i can't tell you how boring your tips are they can make or break an earbud and i just wanted to put in a video ho .beats fit pro have ear detection sensors and enhanced find my feature with proximity view .<n>Apple's new spatial audio feature with head tracking is a nice bonus feature .<n> beats fit pro will pair with most other bluetooth audio devices but you'll lose all the extra features .airpods beats has an app for android devices that makes their buds slightly more friendly to android users .<n>The good thing about the beats studio buzz not having an h1 chip was that except for always on hey siri it didn't have those extra apple only features .beats fit pro comes out as the winner over the airpods pro and are the sporty airpods i've always wanted i like the airpods pro a lot and have no problem keeping them in my ears you can also see h .The fit pro really do lock in your ears if you get a tight seal they sound slightly better and have equally good noise canceling their battery life .<n>The hundred fifty dollar studio buds on sale more frequently selling for twenty to thirty dollars off and maybe even approaching a hundred dollars .The beats fit pro are new earbuds by beets .<n>Everything comes in a tiny black box around the box .<n>The airpods pro 2 will be that much better when they arrive perhaps as soon as next year .<n>If you're interested in any of the products mentioned check out the description below for links on where to find them .This package comes with a three month trial of apple music as well as a beat sticker and some other stuff .<n>You get your ear tips so you've got small and large here in case the medium ones that are included on the earbuds don't work out for you .<n>The case is actually a lot thinner and when you open them up you got the earbuds and here you have it you guys these are the beats fit pro .These are a lot smaller than the powerbeats pro case you might like this car .<n>This is supposed to allow the earbuds to of course stay in a lot better than without it .<n>As you guys can see these wing tips kind of rest inside of the ear so when you're doing activities and movement you're jumping all around doing whatever you do it's not going to leave your ears it's going to do a really good job staying in place .With these i don't have to worry about that they do a really good job staying in place .<n>It does take some getting used to having that wingtip just kind of chill in there not gonna lie used to tickle at first .<n>It is so important to have a really good seal so you get the best audio quality out of your earbuds .These have apple's h1 chip so if you're familiar with like air pods like the airpods 3 airpods pro that's the chip that powers those and allows all kinds of cool features like being able to speak to the earbuds .<n>It also allows it to connect to your icloud account whatever your apple devices may be it'll automatically switch between them without you having to press pretty much anything .The beats studio buds are going to work perfectly now even though this is fully integrated with the apple ecosystem the android operating system isn't being left out .<n>If you have an android device and you still want to get the beats fits pro you'll have the app that works so you can get all the features that come with it and still have a good time .These also have active noise cancelling as well as the transparency mode that we like to see with apple's earbuds .<n>They also have an optical sensor so it knows when it's actually in your ear .'ll detect the audio that you're hearing from your ears with microphones it'll adjust the medium to low frequencies to basically give you the best audio quality to fit your ears .<n>When it's in this mode it'll actually give you about seven hours of battery life .<n>When you have the active noise canceling or transparency it'll drop it down to six .spatial audio basically creates like the spear of audio .<n>This has a built-in button you can control all of your audio right from here .<n>The b is an actual button you can control all of your audio right from here .\""
