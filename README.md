# Sentirec Analytics

## Introduction

The intended use for this project was to be a Micro-SaaS app to streamline up the process of finding a product (in the current iteration we are focusing on headphones) faster. The idea comes from the issue of spending lots of time reading top ten best of articles and watching youtube reviews of products, so taking all the information and putting it right in front of a user could be beneficial. Thus, the crux of the project is to use NLP to summarize text and perform sentiment analysis with the goal of showing analytics of summaries of a collection of various reviews. Ideally, a recommendation system would couple this to help users in product selection.
