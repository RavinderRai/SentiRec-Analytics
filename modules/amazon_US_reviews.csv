1.0,Possibly worth the trouble for half the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UUR9TTRF6FPE?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,15 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021",2021-10-26,United States,,"This is the 3rd, & last, set of recently purchased earbuds I'm returning with each set increasing exponentially in price. All were either defective or wouldn't pair with my Samsung Q80R TV. The TV is 2 years old & when I first bought it I bought a set of Tozo earbuds for $30. They connected instantly & sounded great. They also connected instantly with my various phones & tablets. I then upgraded & bought Samsung Galaxy Buds. Again, connected with everything I own & I was very happy until the left ear stopped charging after 15 months. First thought was 'I'm not spending a lot of money for something that only lasts a year' so I bought Tozo's latest & greatest. Wouldn't connect to anything, back they went. So, I decided to spring for Samsung Galaxy Pro buds. Connected instantly to my phone & tablet but the sound was pathetically weak & ANC didn't do anything but waste battery. They're in the process of being returned. After reading tons of reviews I decided to spring for these Sony's, against my better judgment. They arrived & connected instantly to my tablet. Again though, the sound left much to be desired but after 30 minutes of tweaking in their expansive app I got a sound I could live with, though the buds themselves weren't exactly the most comfy things I've ever worn. On to the TV. After FOUR HOURS of trying everything imaginable, I gave up & was going to send them back until last night when I turned the TV on it asked to pair with the buds! Odd, but ok.Then came this afternoon. After pairing with my S20Ultra phone without a hitch, I went to play a game on PS4 & the buds were back to not being paired again. I turned Bluetooth off on my phone & tablet & the TV finally saw the buds but clicking on 'pair & connect' did squat. I turned the PS4 off, thinking that might help. Nothing. Moved closer to the TV, still nothing. For almost $300 these should be about as perfect as perfect gets but they leave a lot to be desired, even without the not pairing to TV issue. For starters, they're supposed to be a close challenge to Bose when it comes to ANC but they aren't even a close challenge to my Tozo's as far as blocking outside noise & my Tozo buds don't have ANC! Turning on ambient sound is also useless unless you're quiet & not listening to music--only then can you hear the sound around you. My original Galaxy buds were great for this at less than half the price.The app is nice but not very well designed, IMO.The Bluetooth is supposed to be 5.2 but acts more like 2.0. I avtually had to turn off Bluetooth on other devices I wasn't using in order for these to connect to a device I was using. My original Galaxy Buds didn't work like this, they seamlessly switched from 1 device to another.These are supposed to have 'wind noise reduction'. I guess their idea of this is that when turned on it doesn't amplify wind noise but you can still hear it a lot worse than if you had nothing in your ears. Again, my original Galaxy Buds, at least than half the price, were much better in the wind (I used to ride my bike with them without problem).Then there's the fit. Sony decided to use foam tips, ugh. They don't stay in & feel uncomfortable after a few minutes. I used their aggravating app to 'fit my ear' & it had me use the medium size of the 3 included Buds (my $30 Tozo's include SIX!) but that took over an hour to do as it wouldn't properly recognize my ears. For almost $300 these should feel so comfy in your ears that you'd never want to take them off. On top of that hour, the first update was well over an hour to download, my Samsung buds took less than a minute to download & install. It actually took 3 tries to download the update as the first 2 seem to stop at 95%, so my total spent doing that was almost a very absurd 3 hours.I had mentioned the sound being poor. I had the volume at 80% & it was barely at my usually listening intensity which is not very loud. I'm 60 years old & listen to music from the 60's to the 90's (most of which are Master level) on Tidal so you can imagine that I don't like LOUD music. I would consider that a plus for these but the few songs that I do like very loud, these would not get to & listening while cutting the grass on my riding mower was useless. Also, the bass just wasn't that deep, even after adjusting it to about as deep as it would get-which of course muddied the mids & highs.I know there's more I'm forgetting but I'm just done with these frustrating things.

1.0,"TLDR Warning !  But if you going to spend this much, you need to do your research - was 4 stars!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROP22HIEW7NCD?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,401 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2021",2021-12-07,United States,,"UPDATE IV:.After several months with many other earbuds, I decided to go back and order a refurbished pair.  At under half the MSRP, I'm happy to live with the issues listed below just for the ANC and sound..UPDATE III:  Rating reduced from 4 to 2 and now to 1 Star!I just received my third set, hoping the issues I highlighted below are quality and not design related.Unfortunately, they are inherent design issues.The third set of XM4 buds have the same dinging tone when you bang your teeth / a slight echo with the same tone when listening to podcasts/the Assistant voice and the same call quality; from a noisy place it's so bad they are essentially unusable for any meaningful conversation..In a final conclusion, I am sorely disappointed in the performance of what is clearly an over-hyped and over-priced Sony ""premium"" product.With what it does well, it excels.  With what it does poorly, it sucks!No bud is perfect, but even sub-$100 buds do a better all around job than these Sony WF-1000XM4's.  I cannot justify $248 for these just for the ANC and sound quality, which I'll miss.  I can have almost as good for much less money.I really can't recommend these to anyone without money to waste...UPDATE II:  Rating reduced from 4 Stars to 2 Stars!.I made a phone call on the WF1000-XM4 in a VERY noisy place and the other end said they couldn't hear me at all well.  I was distant and muffled amongst all the ambient noise that could be heard from where I was calling.  The XM4 was essentially useless in these conditions.  Others online report a similar issue.I called back using my Galaxy Buds Pro and was crystal clear with almost no ambient noise in the background.  Just like it should be.  C'mon Sony!!So, in the space of just over 1 week, I'm awaiting my THIRD set of XM4 buds!  I don't have much anticipation these will be any better, but maybe third time lucky?  I really hope so because the sound from the XM4 is just so fantastic.  That's why I haven't given up on them.  My Galaxy Buds Pro are very close, but the warmth, instrument separation and high frequency reproduction just isn't at the Sony's level.  With the XM4, I truly feel like I'm in the room with the musicians.Can I still recommend the XM4?  To be honest, NO.  I wouldn't want anyone spending $250 to receive a sub-par set of supposedly premium earbuds.  If you want THE best sounding buds with top notch ANC, can afford this much money, and don't make calls in public, then go for it.Really, really disappointing from a major brand..UPDATE I:.With ANC or Ambient mode on and no music playing, I noticed that when I banged my teeth together, I heard a dinging tone, primarily in the left bud.  A bit like an echo.  I even noticed it when the Google Assistant was talking.  There was a slight echo, which was the same monotone ding.  It sounds like a knock on a wooden wind chime tube.  With ANC/Ambient off, there's no sound.  So, it's the ANC system.  I've never heard that on any other ANC buds, even the XM3.  I had 24 hours on the buds.I did a chat with Sony Support and after all the usual questions, a bud reset, and a 3-minute hold, I was told the buds needed repair.  They were OK with my returning them to Amazon and getting a replacement.Those arrived today and guess what?  NO CHANGE!  I still hear the ding sound, though it's perhaps more prominent in the right bud as well now and perhaps less noticeable with the Assistant.It seems like this is a design defect, as others online report the same 'ringing', with replacements not helping.I guess I'll live with it.I was listening to The Living Daylights by A-Ha and realized it's a very difficult mix for buds to reproduce faithfully.  All my cheaper buds struggle with the high frequency details and particularly the bright guitar strums in the chorus, some better than others.  The XM4 sounds so realistic it's like you're hearing the instruments in your room.  The instrument separation and sound stage is outstanding.  I was surprised at the difference and now, my other buds really sound inferior.  I added that song to my Earbuds Test Track list!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I’ve been looking for my ideal earbuds over the last few months and have not found them, until perhaps now, with the Sony WF-1000 XM4.  My primary criteria are comfort/fit, sound quality, ANC/Ambient performance, app customization and control, particularly volume, in this order.I am an audiophile only in the sense that I love listening to music (every genre you can come up with, but especially Symphonic Metal) and want to experience it as close to how the sound engineer intended, with perhaps a little warmth and bass added in if lacking in the original mix.  I use my buds for serious late-night listening, background music when working outside and for late-night TV, not wanting to disturb the sleeping family.  I use an android Moto G Power phone.  I am not an Apple fan at all!BACKGROUND INFORMATION:I believe I can give a fair review of these Sony’s, based on the fact that I have many, many hours of experience with the following buds…-Boltune BT-BH024SoundPEATS H1SoundPEATS Truengine 3 SESoundPEATS T2SoundPEATS TrueairSoundPEATS Air 3Sennheiser Momentum TW2Edifier NB2 ProEdifier Neobuds ProTribit Flybuds C1Soundcore Liberty 3 ProSamsung Galaxy Buds ProSony WF-1000 XM3I also enjoy my CCA C10 wired IEM and Soundcore Q30 over-the-ear ‘phones.-I did like the Sony XM3 for its sound, controls, fit and app, but couldn’t get a reliable seal when even just out for a leisurely walk.  Generally, my issue has been maintaining that all-important seal during activity and the comfort over several hours of continuous use. I have determined that a stem-style bud doesn’t work in my ears and I hate buds touching my outer ear cartilage.  Also, my right ear is more sensitive to having a bud in it than the left, which never complains.  I also have very large ears and even the largest wings usually don’t fit!  I had finally settled on the Galaxy Buds Pro, coupled with Azla Crystal oval tips as being the design that best suited my criteria.  The only gripes were the highly sensitive touch controls, which I turned off and the right bud touching my outer ear, due to the bud’s body shape, and being a constant irritation!So, I was really expecting the Sony XM4’s to be a fit problem since a lot of reviewers complain about the size and foam tips.  I’ve tried foam tips and they can put a lot of pressure in the ear canal if too big.  Too small and they slide out.  It’s expensive the find that perfect size!  However, the ANC performance on the Sony XM4 was something I really wanted to experience, it supposedly being the best in the market, as of right now.  I decided to take the plunge and order them.-UNBOXING EXPERIENCE:  1/10I was disappointed, especially after a $248 outlay!Sony has gone to the extreme with their environmental concerns and destroyed that initial enjoyment of getting to the buds.  Having experienced the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro and Neobuds Pro unboxing, which was a luxurious and high-quality affair, the plain paper/cardboard packaging was a real let down.  The whitish colored box looked dirty and used until I realized it was actually compressed paper material with a simple paper wrapping.  To get the box open, the paper wrapping has to be destroyed. So, once you have your buds, you are left with just a bland, unbranded container.  I like to keep all my product boxes.  While I understand the logic, Sony makes it look like they just went for the cheapest packaging they could.-INITIAL IMPRESSIONS – BUDS AND CASE:  7/10Again, there was a level of disappointment with these.The case has little embellishment, unlike the XM3.  Plain off-white plastic with a smooth upper lid surface and a fine shot-blasted, i.e., slightly textured rough feel to the rest.  Not reflective of a $248 purchase, based on all my other buds.  The lid feels firm at the hinge and snaps into the open position.  It does seem to be more fragile though, compared with the XM3 case.  The size is much smaller with the same form factor as the XM3.  Much more pocketable, but not the smallest on the market.The buds are similarly plain with a fine texture on the outside and smooth plastic inner surface, but for the unique brass-colored accent around the microphone.  They are indeed large at just over 3/4-inch diameter at the main round portion of the body.  I suspect the dark buds and case might look better.  The off-white exhibits the design’s plainness in a more in-your-face way.  This is very much in contrast to the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro, which looks awesome in white, less so in black.These buds have an IPX4 rating which is something, compared with nothing on the XM3.  Not the best in the market, but acceptable.  I would expect better for the high price, especially since the Galaxy Buds Pro are IPX7!-FIT & COMFORT:  9/10Fit and comfort is incredibly personal and you may experience a worse or even better fit than me.  I was pleasantly surprised with how the buds fit.  I tried the medium tips that came on the buds and they were just right.  The tip goes in reasonably deep into my ear canal and the body sits in my outer ear and filled it more than any other bud I’ve tried.  I can see how those with smaller ears will not have a comfortable and a tight fit.  However, the XM4 doesn’t actually touch my large outer ear, or if it does, it’s so slight I don’t notice it.  I admit the foam tip in my right ear is more noticeable as my right ear canal is slightly smaller than the left.  The small tip though didn’t seal fully.  I simply address that with a slight pull after insertion to slide the tip out just enough to reduce the pressure.  Within a few minutes, I just don’t feel the buds.I tried Spinfit tips (CP100, CP1025 and CP360) and they were perhaps more comfortable, but the ANC performance was reduced and the buds wobbled and hung down, resting against the bottom on my outer ear.  The stock tips were better in all respects and I can see why Sony chose them over silicone to hold these bulky buds.-SOUND QUALITY:  10/10 with some EQ adjustmentI did like the sound profile of the XM3 and was expecting the XM4 to be very similar if not the same.  I was not disappointed this time!  As mentioned, I like a warm sound and punchy bass, but with a crisp treble.  I used my XM3 EQ settings as a baseline and adjusted from there.  Over time, my preference has changed and I now like a brighter sound than when I started this search.  When you experience the brightness, and perceived clarity, of the Liberty 3 Pro and Neobuds Pro, for example, you don’t want to go back to a soft sound.I have a large collection of Earbud Test Songs on Amazon Music and I listen to all of them to find the one EQ that meets my desired sound.Check out my Earbud test tracks playlist on Amazon Music:https://music.amazon.com/user-playlists/6c1a03929ed947ab82cc33db24d7c001sune?ref=dm_sh_I4ZRJmh4tIHTtEUHGvvCYkvPiI found the XM3 treble could sound a little artificial on some tracks, but not so on the XM4.  I really, really like the sound from them and with a little ClearBass boost, the bass is powerful and not overpowering or muddy.  I have noticed that the bass is slightly stronger with ANC on.  I use ANC all the time, so that is the mode I set my EQ for.-ANC:  9.5/10I have been really impressed with the Galaxy Buds Pro ANC performance, closely followed by the Liberty 3 Pro.  The Neobuds Pro are in that class also.  The Sony XM4 is slightly ahead, but not by much.  I actually think the electronics are just as effective on the others mentioned, but the foam tips are what give the XM4 the edge. The passive noise blocking is better.  Using Spinfit tips, which, being thin, typically let more noise in, the XM4 is worse at noise reduction than the others.  Also, the foam insertion depth and seal, if not deep and perfect, can really affect the ANC performance.  As with any earbud, the noise reduction is not as good as over-the-ear headphones.  Too much noise gets in around the ear. So, the XM4 wasn’t as impressive as I’d hoped.  My advice is not to spend this much money just for ANC. You can get the same performance for less with the other brands!Ambient mode on the XM4 is not super-hearing, like the Galaxy Buds Pro, but it works well.  I leave mine at the maximum level.  The ambient volume is adjustable.  I don’t use Speak-to-Chat as if I briefly tell my dogs to stop doing something, the buds switch to Ambient mode, which is annoying.  You can adjust the sensitivity, but then you might not activate it soon enough if you’re talking with someone.  It is definitely useful in an office environment on the high sensitivity setting.-TOUCH CONTROLS:  7/10Unlike SoundPEATS, where you get full control via the single, double, triple and touch/hold functions on both buds with all their models, the Sony XM4 limits your options, even though you get single, double, triple and touch/hold for just playback control.  You can change the left and right touch functions, but the options for each are Ambient Sound Control, Playback control, Volume control or None assigned.  You can choose one of each per bud.  I use playback control (including Google Assistant) on the left and volume control on the right.  I have to use the app on my phone for ANC/Ambient/Off control.The touch surfaces are well away from the edges of the buds.  So, you can adjust them as much as you want without any accidental touch operations.  Samsung, please note!The Galaxy Buds Pro will speak to me automatically for incoming notifications for apps you select, like text messages.  That’s my absolute favorite feature of any bud.  I never miss the wife’s texts when listening to music, which keeps me alive!  The Sony XM4 can do the same, but only after you touch and hold the left bud (only with Playback controls set) and then let go after the tone.  Google will then read your new notifications to you.  You can also just say “Hey Google, read my notifications”, which is nice, but you hear all notifications, not just from selected apps.  I have also used Google to adjust volume and switch ANC modes, though Google often annoyingly goes to an article about ANC and reads that to me!-BATTERY LIFE:  8/10I haven’t had a chance to do a more detailed check.  However, it seems like I can get between about the design 5 hours with 50% volume, ANC on, Custom EQ active, DSEE off and using LDAC codec.  That’s at least 25% better than the XM3 and better than the Liberty 3 Pro.  I’m OK with that amount of time as I usually need to go do things without buds by then.  The left bud loses more juice than the right due to the Google Assistant always listening on my left bud.  It is about a 7% difference over 3 hours.I believe the XM4 has a user-replaceable button battery like the XM3.  So if you’re mechanically-gifted like me, you’ll appreciate the ability to extend the life of these buds.  Sony also sells XM4 cases, individual buds, and tips!  Who else does that?  Awesome!-VOLUME, BLUETOOTH & CODECS:  9/10The volume is plenty loud for me.  I rarely use more than 65% as I value my hearing!  I do have the ‘Absolute Volume’ disabled in Developer Options.  I set my phone’s BT volume to maximum and then use the buds to control the volume.  This increases the number of volume steps and negates the annoyingly large Android volume control steps that can mean one setting is too loud and the next step down is too quiet.  The media volume can be controlled almost as finely as a volume knob.I set the buds to highest sound quality over having a stronger BT connection.  So, the Sony Headphones app shows I am using the LDAC codec, not SBC or SBC and DSEE.  I turn DSEE off as I really don’t have much need for it as I listen to mostly high-quality files and that saves battery life.  On the XM3 app, you are warned that EQ + DSEE use more battery, but not on the XM4 app.  However, the DSEE still has to work harder in real-time to modulate the sound with a customized EQ setting, so the effect is the same on the XM4 as on XM3.I never really noticed a difference with LDAC on the XM3 or the Liberty 3 Pro, but strangely I do on the XM4.  A much better sound with respect to clarity and crispness.I use the Sony Media Center app as well.  That can automatically adjust the phone settings for the bitrate you want without having to go into Developer Options.  I set mine to the best possible.  That does affect the BT signal and I get some dropouts if the phone is in my back pocket or if I go more than a few feet from my phone.  I can set the bitrate to a lower level if I want to reduce the dropouts when outside working.  It’s a cool companion app and saves having to set the bitrate every time you connect the buds via the Developer Options and guarantees a higher quality sound all the time.-CALL QUALITY:  9/10  (SEE UPDATE II and III - 4/10)I haven’t had a chance to evaluate this in detail, but I heard and was heard very clearly with a natural sound in a quiet location when I did one call. The buds do go into Ambient mode.  While comfortable and quite acceptable, not as good as the Galaxy Buds Pro, where you almost feel like you have no buds plugging your ears.-APP:  10/10I won’t go into detail on the app.  You’ll be here another hour!  But I will say the app is as comprehensive as you’ll find in the market and is a customizer’s dream.  It’s not as colorful as and is more word-based than the Liberty 3 Pro app, which is also very comprehensive with other unique features.I personally have no need for the location/activity-based auto-adjustment of ANC/Ambient modes and recording of earbud usage while walking, running, etc. and I turn that off.  I use the buds mainly at home and prefer to make my own adjustments.  I also don’t need Sony knowing my whereabouts.  Google is more than enough.  It is nice to know though how much/long per day that you use the buds.  A feature which is always active.  I’m at 2 ¾ hours of listening so far since starting this review and my battery life is at 52%.-VALUE FOR MONEY:  7/10 (SEE UPDATE II and III - 2/10)If it weren’t for the fact that these have the best and most comfortable fit of all the buds I’ve tried, combined with a great sound and good ANC, I would NOT have kept these.  I’m wearing them right now and I do love them.  All genres sound fantastic.I really don’t think they are worth the extra $ over the Liberty 3 Pro, which is the best value of all buds at the current time. What you get for $170 is incredible, but you have to tame the overly boosted high frequencies with the EQ and vocals can still sound a little thin for my taste even then.  Their warranty support is superb.  I just couldn’t get a good fit with the wings.The Neobuds Pro at $130 are also superb, but stem-style.I bought the Galaxy Buds Pro for just $148 recently and they were my number one, but way too sensitive with inadvertent operation of the touch controls.Sony is now my number one as it pretty much meets all my earbud criteria.  Shame it cost $248!  Yes, the Sony app has more unique GPS features than any other brand, but I don’t use/need them.  The ANC is the best around, but not worth another $80 and more than the competition!  Sony does offer spare parts and that is worth a little extra for an extended life, though the technology is advancing at such a rate that these will be for sure outdated within their expected 2-year life.-CONCLUSION:  (SEE UPDATE III)So, would I recommend them?  I would recommend you try them but I can’t tell you you’ll love them.  One thing I learned this year is that there is no one perfect bud that does it all well.  Also, sound and fit are so personal that what I like, you could hate.  I even find what I like today can change next week with extended use.The Sony WF-1000 XM4 are absolutely a bud worthy of a try if you can afford them.",True,Color: SilverPattern: Headphones,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618LfleeykL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61aBTZAZpAL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jui9BI3vL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p2mysGjDL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712DiGSnISL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IHEM95c9L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NZLgQIEZL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qdwT6gh6L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zmPpmaGdL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81--AzoRPEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81C4wydr3mL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FwhmuwupL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rnhXKMTvL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91DZbgBw7oL._SY88.jpg']",2.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,2085.0,1354.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
1.0,"Great earphones, plagued by Sony’s stubborn refusal to fix major known issues [also: earwax issues]",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24VVEECNHNHE9?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,50 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2021",2021-12-29,United States,,"These earphones—when they work—are very good. The battery life is great. And they fit in my ears and stay in surprisingly well.It’s disappointing that Sony doesn’t offer wider codec support: e.g. any of the aptX codec family.The charger case is an abomination, having apparently been designed with a rubberized coating specifically engineered to rub off as easily as possible and become ugly after mere days of non-abusive use (literally just resting in a pocket with no keys). The mere fact that companies sell the equivalent of cell phone cases for these things is an indictment in itself.At least Sony improved upon the XM3 charger case by realizing that it might in fact actually be useful to have a flat bottom so that the stupid thing can actually sit upright and be used in a somewhat non-idiotic upright manner. I don’t know what they were thinking with the XM3 design.Okay, now it’s time to discuss “crippling hardware problems in Sony’s various noise-cancelling headphones that they refuse to acknowledge or fix despite those issues being widely reported and known about for multiple years”.I noticed that whenever I enabled ANC (noise cancelling), the right earbud would continually make an odd constant noise: kind of like static, or wind noise, or that weird sound you hear in your ears sometimes after swimming for too long.No amount of troubleshooting would alleviate the problem with the right earbud. I tried everything. So, the only option was to literally get a replacement for the entire set of earphones. Wonderful.What’s particularly obnoxious about this, is that across the Internet, many many people on forums and support boards are aware of this widespread problem. It affects, at the very least, this product (WF-1000XM4), as well as the last two generations of over-ear noise cancelling headphones (WH-1000XM3 and WH-1000XM4), and possibly other products too.Yet, Sony never acknowledges the problem or fixes the underlying issue. It even spans across distinct models of headphones released at different times with a redesign in between! (WH-1000XM3 to WH-1000XM4) I guess they didn’t think fixing this issue was worth including in that redesign.For whatever reason, Sony would rather users be baffled about the problem and eventually have to go through a product replacement, than to put a simple freaking knowledge base article on their website acknowledging and describing the problem, and then actually FIX the problem (whether it be via a hardware change, or a firmware update, or whatever).No; Sony would prefer that users are forced to cast about to third-party forums to even find out that this is a common problem. And then for all the customers who had it happen outside of warranty coverage, it’s up to random people on the Internet to discover for them that—at least for the over-ear headphones—literally shoving a silica gel desiccant pack somewhere inside the headphones seems to alleviate the issue in many cases. (No, I did not just make that up. That is literally the community-recommended fix. And it’s obviously infeasible for the true wireless earbuds like WF-1000XM4.)“Industry Leaders” don’t pull this kind of crap. Sony needs to step up their quality control, pull their heads out of their respective dark resting places, and actually acknowledge problems like this one and at the very least *attempt* to do something to resolve the design flaw itself, instead of ignoring customers on their support forum and continuing to manufacture the same broken junk when they *know* it’s broken.UPDATE (Nov 2022):After just under a year of owning my actually-working set of XM4’s, the right-side earphone very suddenly lost a tremendous amount of battery life (down to, at best, maybe ~33% the battery life of the left earphone) and also started to become noticeably hot after charging.Fortunately I was still just barely within the 1-year limited warranty period, so I filed a warranty claim and Sony was willing to provide a full product replacement. Unfortunately they do not offer any sort of “advance replacement” (many companies offer this: basically they send you the replacement product first and then you send back the defective unit once you get the replacement one), so I had to go a few weeks on backup headphones, which was annoying. They did at least provide free return shipping though, so there’s that.Not very confidence-inspiring to have this sort of sudden problem arise after under a year. Most likely it’s a problem with the lithium ion battery in the earphone going bad suddenly; or possibly the charging circuitry in the case lost its mind and started doing something like over-charging the earphone battery past the maximum point, or short-circuiting it and over-discharging it, or something of that nature.EARWAX ISSUES!Another thing that had started to substantially bother me by this point, is earwax problems. I personally have white-person-type “wet” type earwax (orange and gooey); due to a genetic quirk, the vast majority of Asians have “dry” type earwax (not as orange and more flaky, rather than gooey/liquidy). I am starting to think that Sony, being a Japanese company, may make design decisions that unintentionally presuppose dry-type earwax (since I imagine almost everyone at Sony HQ has that type of earwax).So here’s what the earwax problem is. I don’t have excessive amounts of earwax, and I do a pretty good job of keeping my ears clean. Nevertheless, I have that orange gooey/liquidy type of earwax.I need to digress for a moment to explain some parts of the earphones so this will make sense. The “business end” of the earphones (the part where the sound comes out) is sort of a tube, jutting out from the body of the earphone; and that tube contains a little cylindrical piece of dark gray foam (which I will call the “plug”, since I never could figure out its official technical name). Note that the foam earphone tips (small/medium/large) are a distinct thing from the “plug”; the tips are the vaguely-donut-shaped bits that fit around the tube and seal up against your ear canal.Okay so here’s what happens: when the earphones are properly in my ears (nice and tight, not loose and letting in extra outside sound etc), the end of the foam “plug” is maybe only a couple millimeters recessed relative to the end of the foam earphone “tip”. And what happens is that my gooey/liquid type earwax basically soaks into the “plug” foam as if it was a sponge. (Yeah, it sounds gross, but that’s just what happens.) And at a certain point I started being concerned about why one of my earphones was noticeably quieter than the other. Turns out, the earwax soaking into the foam “plug” like a sponge fills the tiny holes in the foam, reducing and eventually even blocking sound from coming through.So what I learned that I had to do as a basic maintenance step, once a week or thereabouts, is to take off the earphone tips; use a toothpick or other pointy object to “grab” the end of the “plug” foam cylinder; stretch it out the end of the “sound tube” as much as feasible without ripping the glue that secures it at the base of the tube; and then “wring out” the stretched-out “plug” as if it was a sponge by squishing it inside a tissue. The tissue would always show a decent amount of orangey liquid absorbable after doing this. And then I’d stuff the “plug” back into the sound tube, put the tips back on, and any reduction in volume would be mitigated.The problem with all of this is that NOWHERE in any of Sony’s manuals or online documentation or anything, is there ANY mention of this issue (let alone an official procedure for the approved way to clean it out). It seems clear that Sony simply never even considered the possibility that this might be a problem for non-Asians who don’t have dry-type earwax. Yet I discovered that this was the problem I was having, as well as the way to fix it, based on forum posts by community members complaining of reduced volume who eventually DID figure out the situation (totally separate from Sony). And unfortunately, stretching/pulling on the foam “plug” to get it out far enough to where you can squeeze out any soaked-up earwax is very clearly something which was never intended to be done by product users, and risks detaching (and maybe even losing) that important little piece of protective foam which is merely held in place by a tiny dab of glue at the base of the sound tube and can’t be reattached if the glue connection is broken.So, if your genetics are such that your ears have that annoying sticky gooey “wet-type” earwax rather than the flaky “dry-type” earwax, it’s likely that you may encounter reductions in volume from time to time that can only really be resolved by stretching that foam “plug” out and wringing it, which is (a) something you’re unlikely to realize is even the problem/solution at all in the first place unless you get lucky and find a forum post or this review or whatever that mentions it; (b) an annoying and arguably gross thing to need to do as regular maintenance; and (c) something that Sony clearly never anticipated that end users would need to do, and which may very well result in the “plug” breaking free and becoming lost, which is almost certainly something they would consider user-inflicted damage based on improper maintenance (because the maintenance procedures in the product documentation don’t seem to even consider you’d ever need to do anything like this and the product clearly wasn’t designed with it in mind).So, beware the dreaded earwax sponge effect and the issues it presents.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],3.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,2085.0,1354.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
1.0,Connectivity errors that ruin stellar performance - real disappointment from a sony user,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EWLSN894UODC?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2022",2022-12-03,United States,,"Edit:Connection drops very briefly every time I use them.Down to one star from, 2.------------------------------------------------I've been using these earbuds since I got them. Tested them immediately out of the box.For context, I'm coming from the sony wh-1000xm4 and had a good run with it until the right cup started to have a high pitched sound, with noise canceling turned on. I needed a solid replacement. I've had that since 2020 and was sad to see it break down after 2 years. I had very high hopes that this pair which comes from the same series will deliver.For the almost 200 dollars we have to pay for this device, and the alternatives present, unless this is a faulty product I was delivered, this has been quite a disappointing buy.Connectivity:My biggest gripe with this product. Within a day of wearing this product and using it, I noticed that the right bud would lose music and the ANC, or turn itself off. I would have to touch it to try to turn it on until it pairs again with the device. This has a been a very regular thing with this pair that I have and takes you away from the immersion you'd like to have with a product like this.However this was not the worst instance, as I lost connectivity even if both buds were on full battery power and accidentally blasted my office with my work music. (That was embarrassing, but I played it off and made it funny). This has NEVER happened before with my sony wh-1000xm4's and if those did unpair for any reason, the music would auto pause. This case was just inexplicable and had made me lose trust in wearing this pair in an office or an outdoor setting, which is the reason I bought it for.This unpairing/losing audio on the right earpiece is constant, and while the random shut off was isolated, I have no doubt that it might happen again.With this being the primary function of these buds, I now have low confidence in wearing these around as a daily driver.Fit:I first noticed how big the size of these buds were, compared to some other buds that I've used. That was fine as I know that this means it must have great performance underneath. I was right about the performance (which I will talk about later). The big issue with this is even though I switch out the foam tips to the smallest size, it doesn't take long for the buds to hurt my ears while wearing them. At first I was wondering if it was the bud size, but realized that the size of the whole piece itself was a tad too big for my ear shape.With that being said, these buds won't easily fall off if you make sure you press them in snuggly.ANC:Noise canceling is still very good when the buds are working. The memory foam tips do actually work. But this all is a matter of fit, as any looseness of fit on your ears, will drastically allow ambient noise to creep back in. For context, I am able to walk around outside and not hear the cars unless one whips past you with throttling their engine. You will still hear higher pitched sounds that don't give the microphones time to cancel them out.Audio:Audio quality is generally great and what is expected from a Sony product. Recently though, I did notice some dip in audio quality which I tested with my headphones, and it was noticeably different. Know that I'm not an audiophile or a sound engineer, but have very heavy use of my sonyheadphones for music on a day-to-day basis so I notice dips in quality very easily. For the most part when the audio is good, I still love listening to it and having the companion app to switch audio profiles to my liking.Touch gestures:The gestures are quite finnicky on this. The right bud is never consistent with the paus and play on tap. The left however is more consistent with switching from ambient sound and noise canceling modes. You just have to keep your finger on it until it registers the touch.Turning on pairing mode can be often hit and miss, so I just have to keep trying until it turns pairing mode on, which can sometimes take a good 30 seconds or, putting them back into the case to reset them.Case:Case is solid and it works. A bit hefty and bulky, but this is also due to the size of the buds.",True,Color: SilverPattern: Headphones,[],4.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,2085.0,1354.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
1.0,Too expensive for the problems I've had.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3459CD5UXSEKK?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,10 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2023",2023-02-02,United States,,"Edit - one star. I'm having the same battery problems on my SECOND set that I did with my first set. Sony's trying real hard to not acknowledge this massive problem with their earbuds and have already released the XM5's. No more Sony earbuds for me.Sound quality is all subjective - for me, I enjoy bass and within the Sony Headphones App, there's an option to boost the bass. This is what I listen to all my music at. Some people might find that abhorrent but it's my preference and the app has many EQ options to tinker around with.As for features, there's noise cancelling, which is good - there's also a transparency mode that lets noise in so you can hear your surrounding. The app has different features, as well. You can enable a speak to chat feature which waits till you start talking and pauses your music and enables transparency so you can hear the person you're talking to - I personally don't use this feature as I find it easier to just pause the music to talk. There's also voice assistant integration built in but that's really not a feature I use, either. They're there if you need or want them, which is good considering the price.Now, onto the negative - first, a little over a year of owning these earbuds and the right bud started to drain very fast - I would only get a few hours out of it before it was dead. When I put it into the charger, it would get hot (hot for earbud standards - your earbuds shouldn't ever be close to ""hot""). This was happening for a while and this quick draining and heating up was eventually going to destroy my earbuds - bear in mind, this is after have them for only a little over a year.After looking up the problem, I found out that it may have been a firmware issue that plagued only older models of the XM4's. I contacted Sony and they told me to mail in my set and they would replace them, free of charge, which they did. Sony Customer Support was very helpful. The problem is that my $300 earbuds shouldn't be plagued with firmware issues that can't be resolved unless they're replaced 100%. I didn't want a replacement, I wanted what I paid for to work without problem for YEARS.My second issue is charging - I've had TWO sets of Sony WF-1000XM4's and BOTH sets outer shell plastic has melted slightly because of what I assume is how they charge. Both sets have peeled slightly in the front because of where the battery is located and how warm they get while charging (I assume). This is ridiculous. These earbuds cost more (for the majority of their market life) than Apple Airpods Pro - earbuds infamous for a ridiculous price tag. When you pay $300 for earbuds, they should WORK FLAWLESSLY. I shouldn't need a replacement, peeling cases, earbuds getting too hot and firmware issues.I can't recommend these to anybody. Although they sound great and have good features, they're too expensive to be having the problems that I've been having. Save yourself the extra $100-$200 and buy something else.Last but not least, the foam eartips are utter trash. Either invest in some high quality tips or do what I did and buy a set of silicone tips that won't literally deteriorate after a few weeks. I literally used them for a few weeks before they fell apart.

These are my first bluetooth earbuds, although I have tried the airpods pro.My first impression was disappointment. They hurt my ear canals. Obviously, this is dependent on everyone’s ear canals. For some they might be super comfortable and to others unbearable. I was considering returning them since they weren’t comfortable. I’n glad to say that my ears have gotten used to them and I now actually find them ok to wear. They’re not super comfortable, but they don’t hurt either. I feel comfortable wearing these for over an hour.They also feel secure, although do feel a bit bulky.Sound quality:I’m happy with the sound for sure. Look, these are wireless earbuds so obviously for the price you can find much better sounding wired earbuds. I have owned many earbuds and headphones over the years. To me, the sound quality is similar to well sounding wired earbuds in the $50-$60 range. I’m very happy with the sound. I wasn’t expecting these to sound like my $200 wired earbuds or my seinheiser headphones and expecting that would be ridiculous. Basically, they sound good enough that you won’t notice anything sounding off (flat/muddy/sharp). So as far as wireless earbuds/headphones go they sound excellent. They definitely sound MUCH better than airpods pro. To me, airpods pro sound like $20-$30 wired earbuds. The sound is clear and balanced.Noise canceling:It works great. They cancel out as much noise as hero earplugs. Basically, when using these in the bathroom with the fan going I have to focus to be able to hear it. If the ac is on I can barely hear that as well. I think these are better at noise canceling than airpod pros, but not by much. I think most top wireless earbuds have similar noise canceling capabilities.I love the ambient sound option. One quick tap and I can hear as well as I do without them on.Build:The build quality is top notch. The case could be nicer, but it’s still great. The magnets that hold the earbuds in the case are very strong, it would actually have been better if they were slightly weaker imo, but we’re nitpicking here.The app seems good but frankly I haven’t bothered with the features. It’s user friendly and I had no issues setting it up with my iphone, ipad, laptop, and desktop.I took away half a star because they weren’t comfortable at the start, they could be more comfortable. The price is very high and I don’t think they’re worth the almost $300 I paid after taxes. However, these are top of the line earbuds and anything that’s top of the line usually has diminishing returns from a price/performance perspective.I think 4 stars is a fair rating. If they were very comfortable and felt less bulky they would be an instant 5 stars.Also, battery life is great.***Update***I can no longer recommend these. These are the most expensive earbuds/headphones I’ve ever bought and it’s been nothing but trouble. For the past few months they’ve been having problems charging and holding a charge. The case basically holds no charge anymore and my right earbud rarely charges above 80%. Both earbuds lose their charge at twice the rate they used to. It’s incredibly disappointing to drop $300 (bought when first came out) for earbuds that are so quickly failing. Yes, the sound quality is the best I’ve heard regarding wireless earbuds which is why they deserve that star.

The device worked fine for a little over a year until it couldn't hold a charge for more than an hour.I called Sony customer service, and they acknowledged that was due to a manufacturer malfunctioning.They offered to send a replacement once I returned the faulty unit, which I insisted on telling them that I would probably not receive the package on time since I was going to be out for a few months and the RMA process was too lengthy.For that reason, they included fast shipping both ways. I sent the unit as soon as I received the email with the instructions, and there was a delay on the courier side, or the inspection took longer than it should which led to the package being delivered a few days after I moved out.The building management returned the package to the courier (Fedex), and they keep asking me for a tracking number which I don't have.

It was a complete waste of time.Long story short, they technically stole my product and are unwilling to make things right.

In almost every metric these are fantastic buds. They do come at a premium but I thought it justified for the quality and what I thought would be long-term reliability.However I have become victim to a well known issue with these that I was not aware of at first. With very little research I have found that I am far from the only one to suffer for battery issues with barely a year of use but conveniently just outside of warranty. I wish I had done a bit more digging before I splurged almost $300 on these essentially throw away and disposable earbuds.For the first majority of the year everything was great. They delivered on what had been promised and I was more than happy. But 11 months in I noted that the charging case did not seem to hold as much charge anymore as they used to. It was minor and did not impact my use at that time. It maintained this state for some time until just after 12 months.Now the charging case barely holds any charge and the right earbud is only good for an hour max. I know it's an issue because the bud will no longer even give me a low battery warning. It will simply shut off whenever it reaches its limit.The left bud is the only fully functional part of this set to date and I have little faith it'll last much longer given the other issues. Though once they finally die as well I'll update for prosperity sake.When Sony was contacted their final verdict was simply I was out of warranty, so I could either pony up to send them in for repairs or buy a new pair. Now there is no way I can justify spending a further sum of any kind on a product that will only give me a year of use, but especially not the premium sum these buds come in at.My conclusion: this is a well known and wide spread enough issue that I cannot recommend this product to anyone I know in good faith. It's too much money for a product that fails to deliver too frequently.Given the HUGE range of competing products that are easily of equal quality both at and below the price point I'd look to those instead. Sony was a brand known for excellence but lately they've been sitting on their name to prop them up.

In the past couple of years, I have tested multiple brands of earbuds, cheap and expensive. These are unquestionably the best. There are a few cons, but the pros outweigh the cons by a long shot. Let me start with the cons:CONS:1. The memory foam tips are not durable. They certainly provide much better sound isolation than silicone tips would, but be prepared to purchase a bunch of replacement tips right away.2. Ambient sound could be just a little louder. The level of ambient sound is adjustable (fantastic feature!) but even at its loudest setting, it feels a little too muffled for me. When I am out in the street, I would like to hear the cars approaching and other street noises a bit better, especially if I am jogging. But it isn't bad. I guess I am just used to Buds Pro, which actually amplify external noises a little bit during ambient sound.That's it on the cons!PROS:1. The equalizer and other adaptive sound settings are incredible. Although be prepared that it won't be excellent right out of the box. In fact, the factory settings might suck. But the equalizer settings are superb, so you should be able to adjust it to your liking very quickly. Your first step is to make sure you identify which ear tips fit you best, as it will make a major difference in your sound adjustment. Once you've got the right size ear tips, you can start adjusting the sound settings on your phone. I would start with the phone's own settings first, and then go to the Sony Buds app and fiddle with the equalizer there. It comes with an app that has a variety of other smart settings. For instance, the level of noise cancellation and the volume of ambient sound can be adjusted. You can also program these buds to recognize the environment you are in, and have a few pre-set operation modes, such as for sitting at your desk at the office versus walking in the street, versus jogging. And the buds will adjust ambient sound, noise cancellation and other features based on your pre-set modes for the above conditions. You can also have several equalizer settings customized and saved.Since I have an Android phone (Samsung, to be exact), I started with first adjusting the sound on these earbuds by going to Samsung's own sound settings and customizing my equalizer through the ""Adapt Sound"" menu. And then, when that was done, I went into the Sony Buds app and worked with the equalizer there. It allows you to play music straight through that app (via Spotify or whatever else you have) and adjust your equalizer while music is playing, so you can hear the difference right away.For those who don't know how an equalizer works, I strongly advise you to watch a couple of YouTube videos on that first, so that you know what you are doing. A lot of people discard good earbuds and headphones because their sound is ""bad"" when in fact they just don't know the first thing about setting up the equalizer. I am very picky and demanding in my music settings. I love having such a strong bass that my spine feels the vibration (slightly exaggerating here, but only a little bit), but at the same time I like to hear the vocals loud and clear without distortions. I like hearing high-pitch vocals, and yet, I am not too fond of having excess treble. On most of the earbuds I've tried before, achieving such highly customized sound was impossible. But these Sony buds promised and delivered. I got my settings exactly how I want them, and it is pure heaven.2. Amazing sound cancellation. Here is what I mean. They don't just cancel out external noises. They are very smart about distinguishing between different types of noises, both incoming and outgoing. And you can program the sound cancellation settings to differentiate between, say, human voices and cars honking. As a result, I can listen to music while vacuuming and not hear the vacuum, but if my roommate talks to me, I will hear what she's saying because that's how I programmed my buds.3. Excellent sound clarity during phone calls, even in loud surroundings. I was recently riding my bike with wind whistling in my ears, but I could clearly hear the person I was talking to, and the person could hear me just fine. They didn't hear the wind, and my voice was loud and clear, and not cutting out. This, to me, is just unbelievable. I have not been able to get this with any other earbuds. Buds Pro, for instance, are absolutely impossible to talk to in any loud surroundings. Some other brands, cheap and expensive alike, do a good job of muffling background noises but they also muffle your own voice in the process. This is not the case with Sony Buds. They keep my voice clear while muffling everything else around me. I was also recently walking in the street, and there was a siren. Prior to that, I was in the ambient sound mode. When I heard the siren, I tapped on one of the buds to switch them to noise cancelling. I could barely hear the siren while still hearing the person I was speaking to loud and clear, and the person could not hear the siren in my background at all. I have no idea how Sony did it, but my hat is off to them for achieving such high-quality smart sound.4. Very comfortable. I was hesitant about getting these because they seemed bulky to me. I have very small ears and usually struggle with bulky earbuds. But these are very comfortable, probably mostly because of the memory foam ear tips. Once they are in my ears, they stay there. I've taken them out jogging and bike riding, and they didn't shift at all. Finding the correct size of the ear tips plays a key role here, so you should make sure you got the right size. But once you do, they are comfortable and stay in place for a while. And I didn't notice any burning sensation, or any other sign of earbud fatigue. They stay in my ears for hours, and I am comfortable.5. The case and the buds hold the battery very well. No complaints there. I am either listening to music or having phone calls all day long, and they hold the battery just fine.6. A function that I have not personally used: it allows you to sync the buds with two different devices at once. I don't like doing this, but this is probably a great feature for those who might want them connected to the laptop and the phone at once.VERDICT: Superb earbuds. 10/10 would recommend.",True,Color: SilverPattern: Headphones,[],1.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,16075.0,2661.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
5.0,So Many Good Things + A Few Things to Fix,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DDFOUP2GFXBM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2023",2023-12-20,United States,,"I've had these ear buds for a few years now. They're still in great working condition and charging well. I may be repeating others, but here's my list of Pro's & Con's:PROS-The sound quality and bass is fantastic! (...for ear buds.) They're not going to compare to headphones, but they're the best I've come across by far for buds.-Both the 'Noise Canceling' and 'Ambient Sound' features are far better than any other ear bud I've used (I have a few different kinds because I cycle through which ones are lost). With noise cancelling on, the rest of the world disappears, which is my favorite thing, even though it's gotten me in trouble with my man a few times. But sometimes, it's really nice to shut off the rest of the world. You'll still hear loud sounds, but it shuts off pretty good. The Ambient Sound feature should not be ignored though. I'm not sure what tech they use, but they've clearly fine-tuned the balance and clarity of outside sounds while still clearly hearing what you're listening to.-When they're connected to one device and you want to connect them to a different device, it automatically switches devices without you having to find the other device and to disconnect first. This seems like a small thing, but this has been magical for me since none of my other ear buds do that and they SHOULD!-Battery life is pretty fair, even after a few years. I can use them for about 4-5 hours straight of solid use. It could be better, but not bad, esp for being a few years old.-There's probably more that I'm not thinking of now, but I'll update this as they come to mind.CONS-My biggest gripe about these buds, which is definitely a big'n for me personally, is that you can't use the left ear bud without the right one. So if the right one is dead or charging, the left one won't do a derg-nerbin thing. It's very frustrating. Oddly, there was a small period of time when I was able to use the left without the right, but then it stopped working. My husband had a pair of these (I've had 2 pairs, since I lost the first one), and they all did that, so it's not just my pair.-They are a little bit bigger than other ear buds. Not a huge deal, especially with what they pack into this little bud, but it would be nice if they were a little bit smaller. They're still lightweight and comfortable in my ear.-It's pretty obvious that these little buds are on the expensive side for sure. It's been worth it for me in the long run, but it's certainly a chunk of change.Overall, these are still my preferred ear buds, and I use them A LOT. Looking forward to getting the next version some day when I can afford it.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],2.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,16075.0,2661.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
5.0,The best earbuds I've had and still going strong nearly 2 years later,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20NE0970YCNSP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,18 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2022",2022-11-05,United States,,"These were expensive but when it comes to sound quality and noise cancelling, I don’t want to cheap out and these didn’t disappoint (I think I bought these at full price too at something like 300$). The noise cancelling honestly feels like magic when I turn it on. It still gives me goosebumps. I've used these earbuds nearly every day for like the last year and a half and have had zero regrets in buying them.Pros: Fantastic sound quality, comfortable fit (I've forgotten I was wearing them on occasion), magic noise cancelling, long battery life, durable earbuds, easy touch controls, outside noise isn't blocked at all when ANC is off so others are still easily heard and understood, sound profiles with the app are pretty easy to play around with and offer some good customization.Cons: Foam ear-tips can get really nasty if used at the gym or for extended periods without taking the time to clean them thoroughly, charging case build quality isn't great (creeky plastic and has some give where others are much more solid feeling), possible bluetooth interference from time to time, simultaneous dual device connection isn't really a thing despite the marketing, no tracking method on the case is a bit of a bummer for earbuds this expensive.I’ll jump into the aspects I disliked since they’re easier to write about.I’d tried beats before these and while I also liked those (and at their price points, they are quite competitive) I found these to have superior noise cancelling and were a bit more comfortable to wear for extended periods.I don’t think they’re the most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever used and frankly, if they were any less comfortable I would have returned them and repurchased the beat fit pro’s I’d originally bought and saved a hundred dollars. I did find the Sony pair to be the more comfortable of the two hence why I stuck with them. I think the issue I have with them is that they’re just a bit large and it can be difficult to feel exactly how they’re supposed to sit in your ear. The way you see them pictured isn’t very comfortable for me so I don’t feel like I’m necessarily wearing them “correctly” but they don’t fall out during my gym time and they don’t look like I’m wearing them the wrong way so it’s really just a nitpick. They don’t sit as flush with my ear as I’d have liked. They look fine though in the mirror. I don’t feel self conscious while wearing them in public which I’d worried about when seeing how large they were.*That could make the difference for you if you like to wear earbuds to get some peace and quiet and get a nap in since they’ll be pushing against your pillow and that’ll get uncomfortable very quickly.The ear tip pieces are not the typical silicon material you find on nearly every other set of earbuds, they’re like a type of memory foam. I assume they chose this material to help with the noise cancellation and I’m sure it does provide a better seal between your ear and the outside world but in I’m opinion, silicon would have been better. Reason being that they’re very difficult to clean off the earwax inevitably gets on them. I clean my ears often and you’d think I never did if you caught a glimpse of my earbuds. For whatever reason, the wax really sticks to the foam and it’s difficult to remove. I damaged one of the tips trying to clean it, they aren’t the most durable things.I ended up removing the silicon ear tips from an older pair of earbuds and using them to replace the memory foam tips. I found them to be more comfortable to wear, easier to get a good fit in the ear, and faaaar easier to clean. The degradation of the noise cancellation wasn’t *that* significant. I did flip between the two types of tips a few times to see the difference and it wasn’t much. It’s a personal preference really, I don’t think the tiny loss in noise cancellation outweighs the easier cleaning. **Edit from future me* Good god, please use silicon ear tips. I made the mistake of squeezing a foam ear tip and I discovered that they act just like little sponges where they absorb all the sweat and ear wax that gets near enough. Wiping them down isn't good enough with foam tips.. you have to literally wring them out and wow was that disgusting. That's with *any* foam ear tips though, not specific to these earbuds.I haven’t really messed around with the equalizer settings all that much. I found a suggested setting on YouTube and tried it out and have since increased the bass some but have left the other settings as they were. It’s pretty easy to change them if you’re into that.Battery life seems great. They haven’t died on me yet and I’ve used them for several hours in a session before when I’d listen to podcasts or use them at home to game with.My advice, try the beats pro fit before jumping up to these. Those had great sound quality and noise cancellation but the little silicon but that holds it in your ear became really uncomfortable for me after half an hour or so. If that doesn’t bother you, then you can probably save yourself the hundred dollars and get those instead. I don’t think the improvements in sound quality and noise suppression on the Sony’s is worth another hundred dollars.But again, these are great earbuds and if you’re willing to spend the money, you’ll get fantastic sound, noise cancellation, and a tolerably comfortable fit. Whether or not that’s worth 50% more for over the competition that has almost the same sound quality is up to you.***Update*** 1 year and some months laterI still recommend these headphones. A year on and they're still fanastic for me but there are a few small issues that have cropped up that I'm not sure existed earlier on in my use with them. The most annoying of which is that I will periodically just lose the sound while gaming for a period of 10 seconds or so. It sounds a bit like that trope where someone's pretending they're going through a tunnel and losing the signal so I wonder if I'm getting some kind of bluetooth interference from another piece of tech in my apartment building. It's not an issue that ruins the product or anything but on occasion I have gotten frustrated with it enough that I took them out and used my wired headset for the remainder of my game session.I think another thing to note with these earbuds is that they're easy to drop and the way they fit into the case often means you'll have to pick them back up because you tried to put them in the wrong side. I'm a cluts so naturally have dropped them dozens of times and on hard surfaces but despite that they still work (nearly) flawlessly.The other issue I have with them is that they're marketed as being capable of being connected to two devices simultaneously when in reality, they're really not. You have to jump through too many hoops for this feature to actually work like it's advertised to. It's not a deal breaker but it does mean that if you use them with multiple devices you'll have an extra step to go through to connect them since they'll often end up paired with the wrong one. Disappointing and inconvenient but again, not a deal breaker. They're still great earbuds.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],3.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,16075.0,2661.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
5.0,The BEST Battery Life!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMSXR89A3IKWT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,21 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021",2021-06-11,United States,,"I have been anxiously awaiting the release of the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds and considered them a Day 1 purchase, if they were below $300. I was pretty hyped! So for $279.99, I purchased them on Day 1. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed. First, the case and earbuds did not arrive fully or even half-charged. There was a orange light on the case so I had to wait about 3 hours for these babies to fully charge. It was annoying and anti-climatic.THE APPBefore they finished charging, the first thing I did was install the ""Sony | Headphones Connect"" App on my smartphone and then connect the earbuds to your smartphone as you would any Bluetooth device. You don't have to necessarily pair them through the app. I also own SENNHEISER Momentum True Wireless 2 (paid $249.95) and Jabra Elite Active 75t (gift). It was my first time using Sony's app and the options were confusing and hard to find. I am still figuring it out. Like, can I have the ability to skip a song AND raise/lower the volume on the right earbud?? But maybe previous Sony earbud owners will ride it like a bike.SOUND QUALITYThe sound on the Sony WF-1000XM4 is terrific. It's on the level of SENNHEISER Momentum True Wireless 2 and probably even exceeds it a tiny bit. Is it worth the hype? NO. Maybe it will get better when I can stream ""lossless audio"" through Spotify, who knows? But I should be able to stream lossless on all my earbuds, so they all might sound better. Both Sony and SENNHEISER audio quality are better than Jabra. And Jabra audio quality is still really good, as I use those buds at night to watch movies. BTW, the ANC on Sony's earbuds blew away Jabra and was much better than SENNHEISER earbuds. Sony's ANC may be the best on the market, even with ""Adaptive Sound Control"" (see note below) disabled.BATTERY LIFEThe Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds have an awesome battery life (like 8 hours!), even with ANC on all day long. They exceed anything else available right now 6/11/2021. I can imagine they are the perfect buds for many situations, including LONG days. This is something to get hyped about! The SENNHEISER Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds have a very good earbud life 5-6 hrs with ANC. And the Jabra Elite Active 75t battery life is pretty bad at 4-5 hrs with ANC.The FITI like Sony's new foam design earpiece because it translates into a much firmer fit - better than the Jabras. I can see myself tracking up and down mountains with these earbuds and they will not fall out. The SENNHEISER earbuds have always been a loose fit that I have to constantly push back into my ear. The Jabras have always fit extremely well. Jabras are renowned for their excellent fit. I am concerned about Sony's foam earpieces though. They remind me of the orange foam earplugs I use. Those orange earplugs get really black and nasty pretty quickly. Are my black Sony foam earbuds going to pickup are my dirt and earwax from my inner ear because they are softer than other earbud pieces? Is that why Sony made them black?? Yuck!**Do NOT clean the ear pieces with an alcohol wipe, they will disintegrate! (I made this mistake.)VOICE QUALITY:Ok, this is easy. I do a lot of Zoom-type meetings so I use earbuds like crazy. I might go through 2 sets on a busy day. The Jabra Elite Active 75t earbuds sound way too muffled so I can't use them in my meetings. The SENNHEISER Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds are amazing! They even block out the sound of my dogs chewing feverishly on bones in the same room! The early reports from the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds are not good - my voice sounds too muffled sometimes. People have a hard time understanding what I'm saying. (Note: This was with ""Adaptive Sound Control"" (in the App) turned ON.) I'm going to disable ""Adaptive Sound Control"" (where it listens and adjusts to your surroundings) and try it again for a few days. My suggestion is that you do not enable ""Adaptive Sound Control"" in the app. I'm sure Sony will have guidelines or a fix soon. I still plan to use the Sony's throughout the work day, just not for Zoom-type meetings.***Update: Since disabling ""Adaptive Sound Control"" in the app, my voice is no longer muffled on phone calls or in Zoom meetings.Bottom Line: I'd recommend you buy these earbuds because of their amazing, all-workday battery life!",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518chgVuQyL._SY88.jpg'],4.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,16075.0,2661.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds

I wanted to test across several price points to see which would be most worth the money. I've only had cheap running earphones before (though I have nicer cans that I use to listen with in other scenarios and some nice wired in ears for when I perform live). I don't really care about noise cancelling. My primary criteria were about comfort (and if it can stay in my ear while running), and the sound quality vs price (how much marginal return do I get per dollar). I ended up picking a premium pair because you can really notice how much more digital/fake the audio sounds when testing side by side, the lower down in price you go.(note: a lot of what I put were just notes I was jotting down while testing them. I try to do a more succinct summary in the first line of each option, and then it gets more rambly/random after that)In the running:Sony WF-1000XM4 $189.00 | Beats Fit Pro - $179 | Power Beats Pro - $179 | Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89 | JBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95 | Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99 | JLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88 | Golrex $29.99 | BMani  T16 $39.99Here are my thoughts:Power Beats Pro - $179 (149) - My winner overallSounds great. It is not the best sound I've heard in earphones, but doesn't seem to lack anything. Has good thumpy bass, presence in the mids, and good clarity up high. Nothing to complain about the sound.Big/heavy case (doesn't matter that much, but I do take these on big hikes so smaller case would have been nicer)I think ultimately will be more comfortable for long use than the Fit pro. The stock medium tips fit fine, unlike the fit pro for some reason.Sounds essentially the exact same as the fit pro which makes senseBeats Fit Pro - $179I wanted this to be my favorite. It's light, small, has fun color options, and sounds great. But it ultimately was just not comfortable enough to leave in my ears for longer than 45 minutes. This would vary from person to person obviously.Pretty comfortable, but had to switch to the small eartips (only earbuds I had to switch from the medium/stock tips). Stays in the ears well, but I think that the whole thing being in there will get uncomfortable pushing my ears after a while. Really little case which is nice.Really great clarity, feels perfectCan't find any eq in the app, but I didn't feel the need to adjust any eq settings either, every band/frequency was very satisfying, so that's kind of nice not having to set it myselfSony WF-1000XM4 $189.00I believe this has a slightly fuller sound quality to it. Can't really pinpoint how or why, but seems to be the most superior sound quality of all of them. I thought it might be better bass but that's not it. I can't pick a part any individual component that seem superior, it just has an overall fuller soundThere just doesn't seem to be any way that these are going to stay in during a run. Would be great for any non-exercise application, but just wasn't what I was looking for. I would choose these if I were looking for just walk around town kind of  earbuds.Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89Great clarity and bass out of the box. I am the kind of guy who can only really tell sound differences when a/b testing it. If I only listened to these earbuds, I would have been fully satisfied with the sound quality, the comfort, and the security. It's only because I tested it next to the premium models above that I decided not to go with this. But if this is your budget range, these are definitely the winners.Excessively comfortable, like the most comfortable of any of the earbuds (premiums included), and feel like they will stay in on a run even though they don't have any sort of little hook like the soundcore or powerbeats, or over ear hook like the others. Definitely the best ergonomics. Would take this over the JBL endurance or any other in the sub $150 price range.Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99more satisfying for non edm music than the other options down below. Better separation for instruments and vocals.Compared against JLabs with blue tips in, the bass is more comparable. Soundcore keeps more clarity than on higher end (albeit a little tinny sounding), than JLabsBass is definitely much better than JLabs. It does feel a bit more muddy because of the heavier bass, there may have been better vocal clarity with JLabsEverything else seems fineANC is decentsmall profile is light, really comfortable and stays in the earsJLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88bigger profile, slightly less comfortable than the Soundcore.

5.0,Sony upgrades darn near everything and is on top again!***Update***,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DJ0QD0F8NLZ0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,"1,843 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2021",2021-06-09,United States,,"Back in 2019, Sony shook up the ear bud market by offering the oddly shaped but highly effective WF-1000XM3's. They offered great sound with, at the time, effective Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), decent phone call quality, and so much more. If you need evidence of how good these are, Google ""best wireless ear buds"" and you will still find them on most lists some two years later. I used them for about a year before gifting them to my sister. They were ahead of their time in 2019, on par with the best in 2020, but now find themselves with some serious competition in the premium ear bud space. Since 2019 Apple, Bose, Master&Dynamic, Klipsch, Sennheiser, Samsung, Bowers&Wilkins, and so many more are all offering premium buds with serious tech packed inside of them. Sony had their work cut out if they wanted to regain the title. If you want to skip a long review, Sony has accomplished a great deal here. The buds are outstanding. Sound, ANC, battery, and form factor are all significantly improved and this is coming from the aforementioned great foundation of the 1000XM3's. They aren't perfect but they are really good. I usually do bullet points of my pros and cons but there aren't many cons and I think you guys will likely get the most benefit from comparing these to other premium buds in the market. So here we go.-Sound: Sony is featuring a single very well tuned 6mm driver here. They are really good. Natural is what come to mind here. For buds, they have a nice wide sound stage, rich lows, present mids, and nice crisp highs. Sony has their proprietary 360 surround here again which is really cool when it works. Only certain high quality streaming music apps like Deezer, Tidal, QoBuz, Amazon HD, etc can take advantage of it and then only certain tracks are engineered to work with it. Apple and Samsung's Spatial Audio options are better but it sounds very cool when you experience it. Speaking of premium streaming apps, I need to stop and say this now: Sony is only offering one premium Codec with these and that is their very own LDAC. There is no AptX HD/Adaptive here. It is LDAC, AAC, and SBC. In order to really get the most out of these, you need to upgrade to a service like Tidal, for example, that will put out LDAC audio. It is a noticeable improvement even to my old ears. Apple users are stuck with AAC which is okay and certainly an improvement over the SBC default option. Comparing these to the other premium buds available gets tricky. To me, the new Dual Driver Bowers&Wilkins PI7 are in their own class and at $400, they should be. These compare very nicely to the M&D MW08s and the Klipsch Mclarens. In regard to sound, these nudge out the Bose QuietComforts, the latest Sennheisers, and the UE Fits for me but it is close.  Sony bests the Airpod Pros, Samsung Buds Pro, and the Jabra 85ts more easily. Overall, most folks should be happy with sound here.-ANC: It is good here. Very good for buds. In my experience, ear buds are hindered by their lack of physical size and the need for a seal in your ear. Over ears are always better for this reason. To me the Bose QuietComfort buds are the kings of ANC and Sony hasn't done enough to dethrone them. Man it is close though! All of the other premium buds I have mentioned fall in line behind Sony here. It pretty much wipes out everything around you only allowing the most jarring sudden noises in. Music, televisions, conversations, fans, presumably airplane engines are nearly 100% erased. The buds can adjust based on the noise around you. It is all just very well done. It feels right to me to have Sony and Bose lead the ear bud category in ANC quality. After all, they own the over ear category. Well done here.-Calls: This was an area the 1000XM3's showed their age to me. The 1000XM4's fix all of that. To me, these are among the very best in the business on call quality. Apple still owns the crown but, after that, no other bud I have used sound as good on either end of a call. I need more time here to be sure but after handling a handful of calls today, I feel comfortable giving high marks here. I always test calls outside to see how bad wind interference is. Sony really nailed it here. I think. More to come, I promise.-Form Factor:  Okay so, for me, this is where the pure glow of the review fades a bit. If there is an area that Sony missed here, it is in pure physical design. They definitely stick out of your ear and they aren't the lightest buds around so they don't feel great in ear for me. For the record, ear buds that hang out of your ears like pegs are a pet peeve of mine. These are not as bad as the Melomania buds (the kings of peg design) in that regard but they are noticeable. Quite noticeable. These aren't as big as the Bose QCs but the Bose have a slimmer profile opting for more of an elongated look that is actually more in line with the last gen Sonys. They come with sort of a hybrid finished foam tips. I don't love them. I will have my own silicone tips on here by the weekend. The touch pad  buttons work flawlessly, almost never failing to register a tap. Sony finally gave these an waterproof rating. IPX4 is here so they are sweat and dust resistant. Not best in class but I am glad to see them fix the omission of the last gen on these new $279 set of buds. Lastly, I don't know about the gold accents. Totally subjective I know and I get what Sony is trying to do. I think they are trying to add a little bit of class while breaking up the montony of all black or all white buds. It just feels a little too ostentatious to me. Not a deal breaker but it does make me a bit self conscious.-The App:  Sonys app is highly customizable. It allows you to control so much including ANC levels, ambient sound levels (by the way ambient sound here is really good), EQ, and more. You can also mange your personal assistant. If you are an Alexa fan, she is built in and works really well. Google and Siri play well here to. Just depends what you prefer.  However, in spite of all of this and in spite of using this app for now two years, I still find it to be one of the least intuitive apps out there. I bring this up because to get the most out of these, you need to use this app especially initially. You will want to use the sound app to start here and you will likely have a little more of a learning curve than many other apps you have used. It's all here it is just a little convoluted.- Battery: Sony's eight hours on bud claim shouldn't really be a win but it is. That is with ANC on. Here are some of the competitors battery life roughly with ANC active and mixed use (my experience not the spec):Airpods Pro: Around 4 hours.Bose QC: 5.5 hours.M&D MW08'S: 9 hours (the best)Wilkins PI7'S:  4.5 hours.Samsung Buds Pro: 4.5 hours.Jabra 85t's: 6 hours.Sennheiser Momentum TW 2: 4.5 hours.I have only ran these down once but in mixed use (an hour of video and calls / lots of music) I managed just over 7 hours. Now wait, you are probably wondering why only 7 hours? I know I was. Then I realized that I was streaming LDAC for quite some time. No doubt the higher audio quality stream was to blame. Regardless, when you see how these stack up, battery here is close to class leading. The Case gives you another 2 charges before you need to plug in. Very good stuff here.- The Case: I hated the last gen Sony case. Frankly, I think that case design is very important to a good set of ear buds as that is what we really interact with most. Fortunately, Sony took the case design seriously here. You get charging via USBC or Qi wireless. It is made of a soft matte plastic that feels good in your hand. The magnets are strong in the case and on the hinge. I haven't recharged yet and will update times when I do but, for now, suffice to say that Sony has a good case here.I will update as I get more time with these but, for the moment, I am very pleased with what Sony has done here. They have upgraded these in almost every possible way. Sound, connectivity, battery, ANC, and more. All better. Of all of the premium buds we have discussed, I think these are the ones I would pick for most people. The Wilkins sound better but the ANC isn't quite as good, the battery isn't close, and they cost an astounding $400. The Bose have better ANC but don't sound as good. The price is a push there. The M&Ds are maybe the most well rounded competition for these. They sound a little better maybe. They have even better battery life as well but the ANC is very much inferior to these. I have some nitpicks. I wish AptX was here. I wish they could have slimmed these down. They could have gone with silver accents instead of gold. However, when you add everything Sony has put together here up, I just don't think there is a more well rounded option on the market. I will tweak and update this review as I go but you should buy the WF-1000XM4' s with complete confidence. Well done here Sony!***Update***Okay, so there are a number of additional things. First off, my S21 Ultra will not connect LDAC with these. Working on it. I have been through every step concievable. The irony is that my LDAC capable Soundcore buds, whom license the codec from Sony work fine. Hmm. Not ready to ding a star yet but close. I do allow Sony location access. The buds are capable of remembering how you like your ANC in a particular environment. Say gym versus office. Love that! Speaking of gym, I threw these on for a 30 minute HOT beach run today. Waterproofing is solid so far!! There is more to unpack here for sure. Stay tuned.Also, I think Sony really nailed the voice to pause tech here. Their over ears has this as does the Samsung Buds Pro. Sony's is so much better than the Samsung version. With Samsung's, a cough would often pause my content. Here, only my voice. Say hello to someone and it pauses. Very well done. The sensitivity is adjustable as well of you find it to be to much. So good Sony!***One month update*** So it has been a month. In the last few months I received the afformentioned Master & Dynamic buds, the latest Amazon buds, and the Bowers & Wilkins buds. As someone that has way too many buds, one of my favorite ways to rate my enjoyment of a set of buds is how often I reach for them. I have used these almost every single day since receiving them. I have grabbed the others occasionally but these have been my primary daily drivers. Sony has just nailed so much here. The ANC, sound, and overall functionality is just so well rounded. These are clearly the best all around buds on the market today. There are others that serve different specific purposes better but none that do everything as well as these. Sony has built something pretty special here. The LDAC connectivity is still spotty for me with my phone but, other than that, there is no area these struggle with. I have even grown to appreciate the look. Mostly anyways. Unlike any other set I own, I don't think it matters what phone you use. Folks on iOS should get these over the Airpod Pros because they sound better and the ANC is better. The Pro's still connect and work better with your iPhone but really, who cares? These just perform better in almost every meaningful way. Folks on Android should get these because there isn't a better all around bud that plays as nice in this ecosystem. We don't have Airpods to fall back on. These are the ones! Buy with complete confidence!July 28th Update: So, a couple more things here. First, I received my second software update for these. Considering that they have been out less than two months and were pretty polished out of the box, that is an impressive level of support from Sony. No other buds I own have been this aggressive with updates. Just so good. Lastly, this thought occurred to me a few days ago and I wanted to share it with you guys: In the last six or so weeks, I have been almost exclusively using these buds. I never do that even when I get something new. A few weeks maybe but I don't think I have ever used one set of buds this exclusively. When I get up in the morning to work out I use my Klipsch Mclarens because they have an IPX7 waterproof rating. When I leave to the office, the Sonys are the ones in my pocket. If these aren't the perfect pair of daily drivers, they are very close. Just so good. Buy them.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JqmNKu2AL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81P+IW2-6iL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YmD0hkFAL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aKdhC0ixL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81l+xlb75dL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zA9GB2IFL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B11I1qwR+bS._SY88.jpg']",6.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,16075.0,2661.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
5.0,The best TWS earphones on the market right now,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R333NJDNAQTO7B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,33 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2021",2021-06-26,United States,,"The Sony WF-1000MX4s are Sony's latest ‘true wireless’ (TWS) earphones meaning that each earpiece is completely separate and not connected by wires. The WF-1000MX4s behave like ‘typical’ TWS earphones and are stored in a charging case between uses which carries enough juice to charge the earphones several times over. Sony's previous TWS earphones were the acclaimed WF-1000MX3s that I really enjoyed so I was really excited when the WF-1000MX4s came out. I’ve spent several weeks listening to and testing the WF-1000MX4s and here are my thoughts.- Sound: I’m pleased to report that the WF-1000MX4s sound excellent, albeit with a caveat. They offer excellent detail and good imaging for a pair of earphones. Instruments come through clear and there’s a good degree of separation. The earphones also support the highest quality codecs available on Android and iOS (LDAC and AAC, respectively), which means that Bluetooth compression should have as little impact on sound quality as is currently feasible. Indeed, in my tests I couldn’t tell the difference in sound quality between the LDAC-connected WF-1000MX4s and a good pair of wired earphones plugged into a LDAC-connected Bluetooth amp. However, despite all the technical aspects of these earphones working so well, the tuning ends up being a bit of a let down. The default tuning on these earphones is very bass-heavy. While some might enjoy this, it’s definitely not a natural or balanced sound and lacks treble. The good news is that the default tuning is a good middle ground for accommodating a variety of media. I found that I could still enjoy listening to music with it and it removed a lot of harshness from some of the less well-produced podcasts I listen to. The lack of treble also made the earphones non-fatiguing and allowed me to listen for hours on end without issue. For most people I think it will be just fine. However, in my case I ended up preferring to use the equalizer included in Sony's headphones app for listening to music for long periods. I found the ‘treble boost' to be the best for me. It should be noted that the EQ setting is remembered by the earphones so it will carry over even if you connect them to a computer or digital audio player that doesn’t have the app. It’s annoying to have to jump through these hoops but I think that ultimately people who care about the tuning will appreciate the customization, while people who don’t won’t be bothered by the overly-bassy default presentation. With this caveat aside, the WF-1000MX4s sound excellent.- Noise Canceling (NC): the active NC on these earphones is class-leading and re-enforced by a couple of tricks that Sony has implemented. The NC can’t match up to the NC on a full size pair of headphones and doesn’t block quite as much as wired Bluetooth earphones (e.g. Sony's own WI-1000MX models). However, it’s not too far off. It’s also noticeably better than the NC that other TWS earphones in the $100-$200 range come equipped with and certainly a step up from what the WF-1000MX3 offered. This level of NC will allow you to comfortably listen to the earphones in an environment where there are high levels of constant background noise (background office chatter, fans whirring, train noise, etc.) In my experience this means that any background noise is still audible with music turned off but becomes unnoticeable when listening to music. What the NC won’t do is block out variable external noise (e.g. someone having a conversation next to you). However, Sony did improve the passive noise isolation with this model by including hybrid foam tips that are noticeably better at blocking out external noise than the tips supplied with previous Sony earphones. Additionally, turning on NC does increase the bass somewhat, which helps mask low frequency sounds. The combination of improved NC, improved passive isolation, and noise masking, makes these earphones excellent at blocking out external noise.- Controls: Sony opts for a simple, but effective control scheme on the WF-1000MX4s. The earpieces are controlled by tapping/pressing the outside of the earphones. The exact function of the taps/presses on each earpiece can be set in Sony's companion app for the earphones. While the functions aren’t completely customizable (you get to assign pre-programmed sets of functions to each earpiece) I had no issue getting the earphones set up with a control scheme that made sense to me. The touch sensor is in the center of the housing at the peak of the subtle mound. It’s also fairly large, which makes it hard to miss. That said, there’s no obvious indicator of where the touch sensitive area begins and ends so I did find that I had to consciously aim for the center of the earpiece to make sure my commands registered. All in all this means that it’s generally easy to control the buds, but there might still be a brief adjustment period.- Ergonomics: these are large earphones that surprised me by being a lot more comfortable than I first thought they would be. While the large size wouldn’t have been surprising a few years ago, the recent trend towards smaller and smaller TWS earphones means the WF-1000MX4s are definitely outliers. They’re smaller than the WF-1000MX3s (though that’s not saying much) but the more compact design makes them feel a lot smaller by comparison than they actually are. When worn, the body of these earphones sits above the concha bowl, held in place by the firm fit of the nozzle in the ear canal. This means that the earphones protrude outwards more than they need to. However, by minimizing the number of points of contact with the outer ear they offer a fit that is incredibly comfortable and is likely to be acceptable to a wide range of ear shapes. So, although the earphones are large and do protrude more than a typical pair of TWS earphones, the design makes the fit incredibly comfortable.- Other features: the ambient sound feature (pass-through of external audio) on Sony earphones is still the best there is. This feature is now relatively common on TWS earphones but Sony's execution is still much better than most of the competition. What sets Sony's implementation apart is that it feels and sounds quite natural. There is no significant background hissing or exaggerated amplification of low level noise. Instead, this is something you can leave on an forget about. I find this really useful for any situation where I need to be aware of my surroundings but still want to listen to music (e.g. while exercising). You can also activate this feature temporarily by pressing and holding one of the earpieces. You can also have this feature activate automatically when talking, but I found that it was either under- or over-sensitive and never quite struck the sweet spot needed for it to be useful. There are other features (e.g. 360 Reality Audio) but I think ambient sound is the one most people will actually use and it is a feature that Sony happens to do better than the competition.- Accessories: The accessories are a little disappointing. While the case is much smaller than the previous WF-1000MX3 case, it is still larger than the typical TWS earphone. Sony also included new foam hybrid tips with this new model that isolate better. However, only 3 sizes of tips are included and the largest are just a touch smaller than I would like. It’s a little disappointing that Sony skimped on accessories here. Fortunately the nozzle is identical to the WF-1000MX3 so the older Sony tips fit just fine, as do a range of replacement options. I personally recommend Comply's TrueGrip Pro for Sony true wireless, which allowed me to get a really firm seal that took the comfort up a level. Overall the case is fine and the lack of tip options is a definite misstep, but one that is readily rectified.- Other: the mic works just fine for calls. Battery life is as advertised. Everything that needs to work does indeed work. While I have seen some reports of intermittent connectivity issues I had no such problems myself.Taking all of these aspects into account, I rate the WF-1000MX4s 5/5 and would argue they are the best TWS earphone on the market. The fact that they are the first TWS earphones to support the LDAC codec means that it shouldn’t be possible for any other TWS earphones to beat them for sound quality on an Android-based operating system. From my listening to them I definitely did find this to be the case. I am disappointed in the default tuning of the earphones and the dearth of included tips, but I don’t think most people will care that much. I think people who do care (like myself) will probably enjoy the included EQ within the app and will already have spare tips they can readily swap out for. Either way, neither of these complaints are enough to drop the WF-1000MX4s down from a 5/5 rating – they are simply the best TWS earphones I’ve ever listened to and one of the best earphones (of all categories) I’ve ever tried.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],7.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,16075.0,2661.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
5.0,Best earbuds I've ever tried,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIONMZEW83LVV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2023",2023-08-27,United States,,"I abosultely love my WF XM4. I can't believe how good they sound with such small speakers and the bass is good enough without being overpowering.The battery life is really good. That being said I did buy mine not too long after they came out. Sony had some that had bad early batches and mine ran into the battery drain issue. The right earbud would end up draining faaar faster than the left. But Sony took care of me even though I was passed the 1 year warranty and sent me out new ones. I didn't have to pay for shipping to send them in either. Sony sent a QR code that pays for shipping when you show it to a FedEx location. It was about a 2 week turn around to get me the new ones. So while that was a bit of a hassle, the issue has been taken care of in later production runs.The noise canceling is amazing. It's better than thick ear plugs. That being said it's not perfect. ANC work best with repetitive noises. Like when I'm mowing the lawn and listening to music I can't even tell that the lawnmower is running except by the vibrations in my hand. But when it comes to noises that changes pitch often like voices, it's not going to do as good of a job. It'll mute them good enough but not silence them like repetitive sounds like fans, motors, etc.The adaptive sound control works good enough. I suppose it's like how a weak set of hearing aids work. You'll be able to tell you have them on but you'll still hear almost as good as if you aren't wearing them.They can handle sweat from things like being outside in the sun working but I don't know if I'd want to take them to the gym.The fit of them is only so so. You really have to have the right size eartips. One of them has fallen out once when I was using some aftermarket memory foam tips. I would have preferred if they had an arm that came down like Apple's do. This is not to say they don't stay in well, just not as well as I'd prefer.Speaking of the tips that's really my only complaint with these. The stock so called memory foam tips are a really hard variety of memory foam, if that's even what they actually are. I could only wear the stock tips for around an hour before they became way too uncomfortable. I don't know what Sony was thinking in pairing those tips with such nice earbuds but there you have it. So you'll more than likely want to look into some aftermarket tips. I prefer aftermarket memory foam but those are so fragile especially when it comes time to clean them. (lol Maybe that was Sony's reasoning with their hard ones?) I've gone though almost half a dozen different foam tips and decided to just go with some silicon instead. The silicon makes the ANC take a small hit. I mean that's just the nature of the beast of much thicker foam compared to thinner silicon but it's not that big of a hit. I still can't hear the lawnmower with silicon. You really just notice the hit when you first change them out and are able to compare them back to back.Sony's app these are paired with is really easy to use and with a recent update you can now pair these buds to two different sources at once.All in all I'm really happy I bought these.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],8.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,16075.0,2661.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
5.0,My favorite non-cheapo earbuds so far,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C5SFAFTHRLUC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,32 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2021",2021-07-15,United States,,"I've had a number of wireless earbuds from Jabra, Sennheiser, B&O, Samsung, and others in the past couple years and these are my overall favorite so far. Here are my thoughts, in long form... on my first Sony wireless earbuds.TL;DR: They're great. Really. The fit and comfort, for me, is excellent. Sound quality is awesome and Sony has a good app. The case feels cheap but wireless charging is super helpful. The touch controls are the biggest let down of the experience (but still good enough to recommend the buds).I'm not listing it in one of my ""categories"" below, but as with any earbuds - make sure you get a good fit. These buds are definitely on the large side (especially compared to the Marshall Mode II, which feel tiny). So they might be too much for some people. So they're not for everyone at least in that respect. I'm also not going to touch on the ANC. I haven't used it enough to really judge how good it is - many others have already done that. Sony knows what they're doing, I trust them there.The GoodSound quality. These sound great out of the box but a couple tweaks of the in-app equalizer and they're right where I like them. These might be edged out a tiny bit by the 3rd gen B&Os, IMO, but still really good.Foam tips. I've used Comply-branded foam tips before and loved how secure they felt but they were a slight PITA to take out and put back in. These are what I'd call Comply-light. No where near as much ""memory"" to the foam but definitely seal and feel more secure than usual rubber tips. As with any earbuds - be sure to actually try the different tips to make sure you get a comfortable fit. Sony's app even has a test that it will run to determine if you have the optimal size.Battery Life. These are probably the longest lasting buds I've had yet, rated at over 8 hours. I have yet to kill them. And these are the first buds to have me considering giving up my XM3 over ears for upcoming travel. Between the 8 hours in a charge and two more charges in the case, these would have no problem getting me to Asia with a quick recharge or two and take up a LOT less room.Sony Headphones App. Having used Sony's app with the over ears before, it's pretty familiar, so I'm happy with it. It has a proper equalizer option (B&O could learn a thing or two here) and has a number of other features built in to improve usage and sound quality. You also get a pop up (on Android at least) when you put the buds in with the battery level of not just the buds but also the case - knowing the case level to a % instead of some arbitrary R-Y-G LED on the case is super helpful.The MehThe case. I did not buy the XM3 buds, mostly because that gigantic case was outrageous. This case is much smaller - though still not Airpods level of tiny. It has wireless charging and also USB-C. That's all great. But it feels pretty cheap. The plastic itself feels cheap and the lid always feels like I'm going to break it or its going to fall off. It has just enough magnetic pull to not randomly pop open (but the buds wouldn't go anywhere even if it did). I'm kind of OK with it overall though, since any changes in material would almost certainly drive the total cost up.Ambient Sound Control. I might have a different preference here on what I'd like this to be, but it's not something I'll use enough to care. I'd rather this ""transparency"" mode significantly lower the volume AND pipe in the ambient sound - so I can tap my ear if I walk into a shop or something without having the pause the music AND turn on ambient sound or just take the buds out completely. Ya, I can tap + hold on the left ear for ""Quick Attention"" to activate that same mode - but then I have to hold my finger there like an idiot if I want to place an order or chat with someone. Speak-to-Chat is an option here too, but I'd rather manually activate it in cases of when someone greets me or starts the conversation vs me having to speak to activate that mode. I just think this could be better.Not GreatTouch Controls. Though let me say that the touches and taps themselves work great. It always responds and I don't have any issues activating anything, I just want there to be more control over what I can do with each ear. Specifically I want to be able to control the volume without losing playback control or the ANC/ambient options. Why not go the extra step of letting me customize each bud for tap, double tap, triple tap, and tap + hold? Even three of the four options would be enough. L: tap for ANC/ambient, double to go back a track, hold for vol down. R: tap to play/pause, double for skip track, hold for vol up. Done. Do that Sony.With all of that, I would absolutely recommend these earbuds... especially if you like taking advice from a random person in an Amazon review.

5.0,Phenomenal.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NGM5LQKR1OC4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,16 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2021",2021-12-14,United States,,"I was on the fence about these for quite a while. $300 is a steep price for a pair of earbuds. But I couldn't be happier with this purchase. They sound stunning. They're super accurate for wireless earbuds. I have some pretty nice audio equipment, but the balance of convenience & sound quality easily puts these as one of my favorite pieces of audio equipment. I was using Galaxy Buds prior to getting these, and I'll tell you, these have spoiled me. I already knew the Buds were pretty flat and super warm, but I'll never be able to go back. These have historically had a few issues but they've pretty much all been fixed via software updates. Including the dreaded ""whoosh"" sound that would happen randomly.Cons:- Case feels cheap. I don't know how this was overlooked. For this price, this is the biggest drawback for me without a doubt.- The earbuds themselves are quite large. Gotta shove and give em a good twist to really lock them in.- They tend to randomly disconnect when not playing audio through them, sometimes instantly reconnecting, and repeating. They'll play the little disconnect chime and then ""Bluetooth connected"" *disconnect chime* ""Bluetooth connected"". I never have this issue while audio is playing.- No option for toggling ANC/Ambient while in a call. It defaults to a middle-of-the-road between FULL ambient & passive noise cancelation. I'm sure this will be updated at some point.Subjective/Meh:• The case is quite large. I personally don't mind this, as it isn't uncomfortably large, but it is obvious to me when they are in my pocket. Decent peace of mind for me, knowing where they are.• Foam eartips - I find them uncomfortable, but I immediately replaced them with a silicone set I found on Amazon that are designed for these. You might like the Foam ones. They tend to provide better passive noise cancelation.• Soundstage is pretty in your face and forward. Then again, I haven't tried the Spacial Audio or whatever they call it, so that may widen it. I don't mind it at all. I love how these sound• While they're not uncomfortable, I don't find myself ""forgetting"" that they're in my ears. They are very present, and quite heavy.Pros:+ Incredible audio quality. These are such an absolute delight to listen to. The separation between instruments and layers is unmatched as far as my limited experience with IEMs. Granted, I'm no IEM expert.+ ANC works really well. While it doesn't cut out everything, it does a really, really, really good job.+ Ambient mode is wonderful. Doesn't sound cheap at all. Super natural, super defined, I've had sounds/conversations going while Ambient mode is on, removing and replacing the earbuds and it's like, it's actually kinda mindblowing. You don't have to worry at all about needing to take these out to have a conversation.+ Standard Touch-Sensor configuration is really great. I've left it how it is. Pretty intuitive. The sensors are also very responsive and I never have to repeat an action. I don't find myself accidentally toggling anything either.+ In-App customization is great. Sufficient EQ options with 2 customizable presets. The ""Clear Bass"" is wonderful too, it really does an outstanding job of increasing the low-end presence without muddying ANYTHING. Touch sensors are remappable and Updates are simple, quick, and roll out fairly regularly.+ Speak-To-Chat feature is really nice. It detects your voice and pauses audio and places earbuds in Ambient mode. Great if you regularly interact with people at work or wherever else and don't want to have to stop what you're doing to have a conversation.+ Did I mention audio quality? I really didn't know Wireless earbuds could perform this well. It supports multiple codecs, and it just, sounds incredible. You'll find yourself noticing little details in songs you haven't heard before. You can easily pick out any instrument in a mix and analyze it in it's entirety. I personally tend to have a harder time enjoying poorly mixed or muddy music, especially older rock, where drums are drowned out or the mix is too mid-foward and it bleeds everywhere. SOMEHOW music that I don't enjoy as much because of that, I find pleasant at best or listenable at worst on these. Such. Good. Seperation.+ Great battery life. I don't ever find myself draining these fully. And charge time is incredibly quick.+ Call quality is good. My voice comes through clear.+ Instant connect everytime I open the case.Trying to think if I missed anything. If you're debating whether these are worth it, I'd say - If you are a music fanatic, and want both the convenience of True Wireless, but the audio quality of really high end wired IEMs - these are it. Paired with really useful features, great ANC & Ambient, these are a no-brainer. If you have the cash, you won't regret these. I don't think there's anything on the market at this price point with this feature set, incredible audio, full customization, balanced sound, that's not riddled with bugs or issues that can really compete with these.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],10.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,16075.0,2661.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
3.0,NO MULTICAST in device - you need to use the software to pair to new devices,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YDP3D0TDWPNG?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,22 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2021",2021-12-02,United States,,"tldr: You bought these and you can't connect to more than one device? use the phone app, to 'pair' your earbuds each time you wish to add a new device. Remove them from the app on the phone then re-add them. Your phone will show you a prompt asking to link the earbuds. NOW, go to your computer or other devices you wish to pair and pair those to the earbuds.  Like other bluetooth devices, you can only be connected to one device at a time, connecting to one device will boot it off of other connections or to be refused to be connected to by other devices.Long version: I didn't pay for these, I was reimbursed for them as an office/technology expense. If I paid for these with my own money, I'd be PISSED OFF about the fact that I needed to download a Sony app to be able to get the headphones into a pairing mode state. I tried diligently to avoid installing any sort of bloatware as the main intention for these was to be used as daily driver wireless earbuds that I can wear between my work and personal pc and mobile phone as I WFH. I don't use these for phone calls but DO use them for zoom meetings.  I'm working with the following comparison experiences:1. some old school GENUINE over the ear beats by dre headphones from 20122. some Anker Souncore Life Notes from 20193. some FAKE wraparound beats4. some Sony ZX's5. some elCheapo phillips earbuds6. Steelseries Artics 9X (to use with a PS5 & XSX ++ w/ 1 pair)Those are headsets I've owned and used for a substantially long period of time. I know my way around cheap to mid-tier audio devices (nothing quite audiophile though).MultiCast issue:  Out of the box, you can't pair these earbuds with more than one device.  I noticed that my Anker earbuds are detected in pairing mode when trying to connect to new devices (right after powering them on).  These Sony Earbuds only do that THE VERY FIRST TIME YOU POWER THEM ON OR IF YOU FACTORY RESET THEM. Never again thereafter.  To work around this I had to download their bloatware app. I call it bloatware because they want to have the software ALWAYS ON to listen to your device location. They also want to 'offer' a feature that is useless 'badges' (think 'achievements' from xbox or PlayStation trophies) for keeping the software 'always on, always listening'.  With those things said, I'd have to say that otherwise the app is pretty good (as it can be). I like the ability to set what the left ear or right ear do when you tap them.The reason I'm keeping them is that they do indeed have stellar audio quality. After listening to music in the Anker's for the past 18 months, I appreciated them for what they were. Ear buds are limited by how much they can output so that they have the battery life to last hours on end. Being able to use the app to set the sony earbuds into pairing mode so that I can sync them to all my devices saved them from being a return.Comparisons: Now when I did research on these earbuds I was planning to go with these or the Bose QCs, but reviewers mentioned that the audio quality was slightly better and that they had a superior battery. I do have to agree with that sentiment for the bit of time that I've used these (will need to follow-up in two years with how these have panned out). I was put off on the Apple pods because they seem to get a bad wrap for going bad and needing to be replaced.These headphones are significantly better than everything else except for the 2012 beats and the steelseries. I'd say that the beats were at par with these in terms of feeling that low rumble and bass in the headphones.  The steelseries havent been used for listening to much music beyond what you'd hear in video game soundtracks, I'd say these seem to be just a bit better in quality but I don't have them setup to do a direct comparison to confirm for sure.Ease of use:I've been a technophile, but I see that as we get older, things become more abstract. I had no idea how to turn these on and kept trying to 'press' on them for some sort of click or tactile feedback, these don't provide that. They do power on the moment you pull them from the charging case, so you'll need to have them in your ear to catch the prompt saying that the power is on or 'that they're attempting to pair'.  I tried to press the sides a bunch at first to get them to pair, not realizing that they are in pairing mode out of the box on first use.  As I mentioned, I tried to use these without installing the sony software, but I found that I was unable to pair more devices after the first one. I needed to install the sony bloatware app so that my phone could consistently connect to the earbuds and set them into pairing mode.Now that I have them connected to my devices and using them, I've found that I just use the play, pause function rather than the passthrough/profiles setting.  It feels like the whole passthrough setting (holding your finger against an earpiece until it temporarily mutes out the audio while keeping it playing) is like a 'gee whiz' feature that isn't practical to most. You can just pause the audio, taking the same effort to hold your finger for a passthrough seems unnecessary.I know others mentioned that the foam inserts are stiff.  This is true, but I've found that I didn't like the silicone ear tips that came with my anker because over time they got weaker and gradually the earbud felt like it would fall out if I didn't twist it slightly.fitment:  it was not clear how these were supposed to fit in your ear. I sort of put it in and gradually started twisting them until they were a snug fit, I see that they appear to go in upside down from how I would have expected, the big part goes up top (doesn't hang down).  Once you have them in your ears properly, they seem to fit snug and secure (for someone who isnt moving around much, I wouldn't probably take this advice if you're planning to do any activity or sudden motion).Final thoughts: These earbuds are RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE for not having built-in multicast in the device firmware.  I do love the feel and quality of the case and the foam tip inserts, but I suspect I could have saved a hundred bucks and gotten some Galaxy Buds Pros instead (maybe).",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],1.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1800.0,862.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
3.0,Temper your enthusiasm for the WF-1000XM4 earbud noise “cancelation” function.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16WF58D1UJ3T7?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2021",2021-09-22,United States,,"The good:  The earbuds and case are sturdy and the sound is great.  If you use the correct ear tip size, then they fit well in the ears and do most of the noise cancelation.  I know wide variance exists in people’s preferences for earbuds.  But for me, these earbud tips are much better for me than ear tips from other noise canceling earbuds.  Also, did I mention I loved the case?The sorta good:  Before posting this, I took some airplane flights.  I thought airplane engine noise would be a good test for “noise cancelation.”  Plus, I had good flight experiences with my over-the-ears Bose Quiet Comfort noise canceling headphones.  Regarding these Sony earbuds, most of the reduction in noise was due to the passive noise cancelation from the earbuds themselves.  The “noise cancellation” software function did further reduce some – especially low tone rumble – but not by a lot.  But as before, when listening to music on while in flight, the sound quality is as good as could be expected.The not-so-good #1:  Many of us who engage in business travel use Windows PC laptops.  While the earbuds can be used on a Windows PC, they might not have been designed to work with a Windows PC.  To get the maximum use on an android phone requires the Sony Headphone App.  However, I could not find any Sony Headphone App on the Microsoft Store.  (I did find what appears to be a scam “Connect for Sony Headphones” for $5.00, with multiple 1 star ratings.)  I could not even find Sony online software to download to Windows.  In other words, if you are going to use the Sony noise canceling earbuds on a Windows laptop, then you will probably need to first program them from a smart phone, and then use them with stripped down functionality on your PC.The not-so-good #2:  I repeatedly tried to program the left earbud via the Sony app on my android phone to control volume instead of ambient function.  However, in retrospect, it was probably a mistake to have connected the earbuds to my Samsung phone via Bluetooth BEFORE I installed the Sony Headphone App.  Because once the Sony Headphone app was installed, it underwent a rather lengthy update.  Afterwards, my earbuds no longer worked correctly – especially the left earbud.  I was just about to return the earbuds, when after lengthy web searches, I found these Sony earbuds may need to be reset.  It is therefore important to know these earbuds are reset in a complicated way entirely different than other Sony noise cancelling earbuds.  Resetting these earbuds involve placing the earbuds in the case one at a time, opening and closing the lid, waiting for various flashing lights, and then placing them both in the case, pressing the buttons of both, and again waiting for flashing lights.  If your Sony WF-1000xM4 earbuds do not work, especially the left earbud, then my recommendation is you search the web specifically for: “How to reset or initialize the Wireless Headphones (WF-1000XM4).”  After reset and after reconnecting via the Sony app, the earbuds worked, but their connection was still sometimes buggy.  They seemed to sometimes have a mind of their own.The not-so-good #3:  I am not sure what’s up regarding noise cancellation.  I read other rave reviews about the greatness of the noise cancellation with the WF-1000XM4.  As before, my prior noise cancellation experience was with my over-the-ears Bose Quiet Comfort – with an active noise cancelling function that really does work great.  I have often used these headphones with travel.  However, when I land from hours of flying, the over the ear headphones leave me with headphone hair.  Plus, I find it difficult to sleep on international flights with headphones.  This is what prompted my interest in earbuds that would also cancel noise.If most any earbuds are snug, this will naturally cancel noise.  That is true with the WF-1000XM4 noise canceling earbuds.  The additional active electronic audio suppression seems only marginally better than the passive noise cancelation achieved with the snug fitting earbuds.  The ambient sound function does seem to pipe in surrounding sound otherwise covered up by the earbuds placed in the ear canal.  But I really don’t need that function.  I just want outside noise effectively canceled. In short, my sense is that the active noise cancellation of the WF-1000XM4 earbuds have only a marginal cancellation of sound beyond the passive/physical noise cancelation from the earbuds alone.  It is challenging to claim these are much better than my AKG Samsung earbuds – which also fit snuggly.The not-so-good #4:  During setup, you will be asked to install Audio 360.  It will give a demonstration of how much better the sound will be.  Using the example, the sound really would be better.  However, it is not until you go through the (uncomfortable from a privacy standpoint) process of taking pictures of your ears that you learn the audio 360 only applies to limited apps and services.  It is unlikely I will ever use this function.Despite the above, I am reasonably happy with these earbuds.  However, these Sony earbuds would be better if they had a Windows app, reliable left earbud button, better active noise cancelation, and transparency regarding audio 360 BEFORE pictures of ears are taken.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],2.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1800.0,862.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
3.0,So much potential... Sony missed the mark on these and here is why...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FAIQNK1V5ETJ?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2021",2021-06-28,United States,,"I bought the Sony WF-1000XM4 right at release time and have been using them for a couple of weeks now, primarily with my Samsung Galaxy S9 at the gym. The only earbuds I have owned up until I purchased these were the original Airpods 1st gen and it was time for an update as they were on their last legs.The Sony XM4 earbuds have so much potential... The hardware is top notch and the form factor fits great in my ears. Here are the two big issues with these earbuds:1. (Not a Deal Breaker) The new foam ear-tips Sony included are complete garbage. My first impression of them was good but after I have them shoved into my ear canals for 45min to an hour my ear canals get pretty sore. In addition, when you smile or make any facial expression you lose the seal and the sound quality goes out the window for a few seconds until you stop smiling. They also slowly work their way out of your ears with each facial expression. The foam tips just don't feel that secure. As a result, I decided to try some silicone ear-tips and they are SO MUCH BETTER. Why did you not include silicone ear-tips in addition to the foam ones, Sony? The silicone has a much more secure fit, is way more comfortable, and the seal remains regardless of your facial expression. Issue number one resolved for a few extra dollars.2. (The Deal Breaker) The volume on these earbuds simply does not go loud enough. I primarily use these at the gym and listen to a lot of rap (Eminem, NF, Mac Miller, Logic, Masked Wolf etc.) and the sound from these just does not pump you up to go that extra mile. It is hard to put your finger on it but one issue for sure is they just don't go loud enough. The other issue is the out of the box equalization and sound profile, the base is great and the sound quality is phenomenal but for some reason Sony has really jacked up the vocal intensity and even the highs don't shine like they should. I ended up buying some airpod pros since according to many, they have been the gold standard. The airpod pros out of the box equalization is stellar, great base, good vocals, good mids/highs. I am not an apple fanboy at all, I am an avid PC/Windows/Android power user all the way but my experience is that the airpod pros get much louder than the XM4s and don't have underpowered vocals like the XM4's do. I have done everything with the Sony in-app equalizer, the android equalizer, and even tried some different bluetooth settings in the developer section of android but nothing helps the Sony XM4's volume and soft vocal performance.Don't get me wrong, these earbuds have some incredible sound and if your don't care about volume not getting loud enough the sound is audiophile quality. The details in the music is phenomenal. They just don't give the same intensity of the vocals and the mids that other earbuds give I don't feel the music like I do with the airpod pros. Not to mention if you try to watch a lower quality youtube video that has lower volume that you want to crank up so you can hear, well with these that isn't happening. I can't believe I am saying this but I like the sound profile out of the box of the airpod pros better!! I do think the Sony's have more detail and have a crisper sound but the airpod pro's make you feel the music and pump you up at the gym to do some extra reps and go that extra mile.Sony, if you read this review you need to release a firmware update to allow these earbuds to get louder and to have improved vocals in the sound profile within the firmware. If I hook these up to my smartwatch the last thing I want to do is fumble around in an app equalizer... please make these sound great out of the box and don't muddy/downplay the vocals. I was able to improve these issues with an app from the play store called wavelet but I shouldn't have to use third party apps to increase volume and get the equalizer settings right. The Sony in-app equalizer was not powerful enough to have an impact, wavelet is the only thing that helped.I think the positives of these earbuds are obvious from the other reviews - The ANC is probably one of the best in the market, they fit well and stay in your ears (in my case I had to get silicone tips), the touch controls are awesome and blow airpod pro touch controls out of the water, the app is excellent, the sound is audiophile grade, the mic is decent for phone calls, the only issue I have which is a deal breaker is that the volume does not go loud enough!!Unfortunately, I can't wait any longer for a firmware update for these to get loud enough if that ever even happens as my return window is coming to a close. I really wanted to like and keep these earbuds but I can't get past the limited volume and underpowered sound profile compared to the airpod pros. I really don't want to return these but I don't think I have a choice.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],3.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1800.0,862.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds

I can't believe how much weight I was unnecessarily bringing around, and the functionality on the WFs is just sad in comparison. If you have an iPhone, get airpods.1 year update: 5/5.I didn't appreciate these buds at first. And even though they have an IPX4, I got supposedly ""rugged sweatproof/waterproof rating"" earbuds for working out. However, those earbuds (Jaybird Vista 2 and Galaxy Buds Pro) have stopped working after regular, rating appropriate use. While shopping for replacements, all the newest ""Workout earbuds"" have THE SAME IPX4 rating as these WXM4s. I find that incredible, it doesn't make sense. These earbuds have the best sound quality you can find (with great IQ customization, firmware updates that fixed my original bluetooth issues AND have the same IPX4 sweat resistant rating that the new Beats Fit Pro have (and the Beats Fit Pro are marketed as a dedicated workout headphone. A dedicated workout earbud needs at least an IPX67, not an IPX4).So instead of spending $200 on an inferior earbud, with just an additional wingtip, I'm just going to up my XM4 use and use the money I save for the XM5s when they are eventually released. I also got some COMPLY replacement ear tips since I'll be using them more.Foam tips fit great and have a really nice seal, but you do need to take more care of them (and pay more attention to ear cleaning).Jaybird Vista 2 stopped working less than a month in. Galaxy Buds Pro less than that (and even with their higher IPX rating were way way way too slippery to wear when you started to sweat). And I'm not going to even waste $$$ on the Beats Fit Pro when they have the same sweat rating with lower quality audio and 2 HOURS LESS BATTERY.Did I mention that? The battery on these things is amazing! Was shopping around and the best anyone else can do is 6 hours with ANC on, these do 8. Great job, Sony.(First review, 3/5 stars) I also own the WH over-ear, comparison below*, and they are perfect, just not in summer because that's major, major ear sweat. These are just about as great, but you currently have VERY limited button customization that means you can't use the most important aspects of the earbuds at the same time.You can only change out the entire theme of the left or right earbud (3-themes: noise cancelling, volume, playback), you can't have some of each. Because there's only one button for each ear, that means you can only have 2 out of the 3 features enabled at a time. Why?What I'm saying is it's either:1. Playback + volume2. or Playback + ambient control.But if I pick playback and volume, I can't control the ANC. With the WH over-ear headphones this is not an issue at all (more advanced features and buttons), but these are airtight buds jammed precisely in your ear for proper ANC fit, and I don't want to put them in and out all the time to hear the outside world... Especially since that's considerable wear and tear on the tips and will irritate my ears. I hope Sony updates the app ASAP because the current button customization is a bit silly.*In terms of audio quality, the two are very similar and have the same EQ customization via the app. ANC is a slightly different story. WH (over-ear) has more noticeable hiss at lowest volume, but I would say has better overall ANC and features. WFs claim to have a 'wind' feature that I am very excited to try as I have had ANC problems on windy days with the WHs (have tried in windy situations, and it definitely helps! Drains more battery though).--UPDATE--As of 06/18/21, the bluetooth connectivity is an issue and has even been addressed via a Sony update (though still problematic).

3.0,Comparing with Bose QC earbuds,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R141V0JBJADN84?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2021",2021-07-28,United States,,"I've recently purchased both Sony and Bose noise-cancelling earbuds and I have some fresh thoughts I'd like to share.Spoiler: I chose the Bose one.I tried both in New York in different situations, like in busy streets, during phone calls, playing music etc.So, to start with, the sound quality and noise cancellation of both devices are superb. I'll stick with the details.In general, the Bose one makes you truly disconnect from the outside world - It is so comfortable and light that you forget you're wearing them. Noise cancellation works perfectly well and really shuts down the external noises. The only issue I saw when comparing with Sony is that I could hear my footsteps, which was a bit annoying when walking.The Sony one, on the other hand, is really uncomfortable. It's not just a matter of changing the tips, the actual plastic case goes inside your ear, and that's not adjustable. To make a perfect fit you have to rotate the case and after a day wearing them my ears were hurting a lot. You just feel them all the time.Also, I didn't feel like it disconnected me from the outside world. It makes me feel like I'm wearing a helmet - like my head is inside a fishbowl or something. Although the noise cancellation is great, it doesn't make the outside world completely quiet. Think of it as the sound you hear when you cover your ears with your hands. It's very very subtle, but hey, I'm here to analyze the details.Furthermore, with Sony, when Ambient Sound is on, external noises sound flat, and you don't know where they're coming from - I heard sounds coming from the left when their sources were actually on the right.During calls, the person on the other side of the call had a much stronger preference over the Sony ones.When I was wearing the Bose ones, they said the noise was loud and uncomfortable, and by switching to  Sony in the same location, they reported it as sounding much quieter.Now, what REALLY turned me off with the Sony one is this: NOISE CANCELLING DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY DURING CALLS! It's basically a feature for you to hear your own voice, but it's super frustrating to be sitting quietly with the earbuds, then making a phone call, and all of a sudden you can hear everything around you. Noise cancellation gets turned off or at least is greatly reduced.Bose has that feature too but you can turn it on and off and even adjust the sensibility.Both apps seem to have similar sets of functions and I will not go through them here as it's already too long. The only thing worth mentioning to me is that you can use the equalizer for the Sony one. Bose just sticks with its standard sound profile, which is good enough.Also, I read a comment here that you can only pair the Sony earbuds with a single device, and that is completely false, as I've paired it with multiple devices and could switch between them very easily.Now trust me, I was super happy with the Sony ones until I tried the Bose ones. It really makes a difference. Even with my points above, I almost kept the Sony one. Here's why:With Bose i can hear my footsteps, and that annoyed me for a while.Bose's case is much largerSony has better battery lifeWith Sony, The person on the other side of the call hears me betterBut then, thinking about the comfort and the ""hands over ear"" effect, I went with Bose.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],6.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1800.0,862.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
3.0,Quality degraded over time,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPTEWCMMCRJTT?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2023",2023-05-17,United States,,"I am writing a review after owning these headphones for roughly a year. At first, I absolutely loved them and couldn't live without them. I work from home and live in a VERY noisy apartment building surrounded by people who don't work at all and really needed something to help me focus and block out all the extra noise. They took some getting used to, at first I could only wear them for an hour or two before my ears hurt, but after a while I could wear them for 4-5 hours with no issues. The sound quality is great, the ANC was amazing, and the voice quality on calls was perfect.After a few months I noticed that I would lose connection in only one ear (usually the right) for a couple of minutes. It gradually got worse and now when it happens I have to put them back in the case for a while and reconnect.The touch sensors on the outside are also EXTREMELY sensitive and I HAVE to wear my hair up in a bun or pony tail just to put these in. I have fine, thin hair (not thick or heavy) and the weight of my hair is enough to change the settings and pause the audio. I hate that.The main issue, and the reason for the low rating, is that about a month ago the ANC noise cancelling feature just stopped working. There is a slight difference between ambient noise and noise cancelling, but not as much as there used to be.

3.0,Was Expecting More for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2723EMWBM8V0S?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2022",2022-06-09,United States,,"Everything is good about the ear phones, except a couple or areas. First is the phone conversation with your noise in the background. If you keep talking when you have noise in the background the ear phones do a good job of singling out your voice. If you stop talking for the other person to talk, the ear phones magnifies the noise, thinking it’s your voice, and you almost have to yell for it to center back on your voice. I had a coworker that had another popular white ear phones on in the same slightly noisy environment and he could talk normal in the environment and his ear phones were able to pick up his voice fine without causing the callers problems for about a 40min conversation. I on the other hand could not use this Sony ear phones because I would have to be much more noticeably louder for these Sony ear phones to pick up on my voice, then validate that it’s me, then I can lower my tone to a normal level. This is not practical for a 30+ min conversation or a working environment.My second pain is the cushions on the ear tips. Sony’s manual tells you to slightly squeeze the ear tips before putting them in your ears, so that you get a good/sound proof fit in the ear. In the 6 months I have owned these, I’ve found that the material on the ear tips can not handle this as a frequent step, as it causes the ear tips crack and fall apart. Sony’s manual also states to wipe the cushions free of debris (earwax) after ear use with a soft cloth. I feel this doesn’t help the material with the test of time either as well. Under normal use, I’ve found that the ear tips last for 2-3 months before they have to be replaced.Given these problems and the price tag you pay for these, I could not recommend this product to anyone. I came over to these ear phones as an avid Sony Extra Bass headphones user that had 4 generations of those headphones and was used to a certain quality at that price point. And because they had earned my trust from that product line, I was a-okay spending $300+ with them on these; even with the mixed reviews at that time. Now, I’m disappointed in my long time friend. Hopefully Sony can send an update to fix 1 half of this problem and source another material that can take 8 months to a year of Normal abuse before having to replace the tips or start selling a bag of ear tips, so people can get a true cost of ownership.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],9.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1800.0,862.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds

One ear didn't fit so well, to the point where I would occasionally have to push it in. Ended up with another brand that glides in. Small ears won't work most likely, due to the ridges in the ear. It'll cause pain over time and with bad seal AC is useless.Software eq is nice but nothing a free app cant replace. Audio mids and lows can be good; however, highs are pretty bad. out of box it is horrible and the device relies heavily on an eq (not even close to neutral). Expect to spend time in the app adjusting the eq base treble and mods. If you have any familiarity with an eq, do it manually. The SW gets about 90%.

4.0,Pretty good but not the best,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26NE43RGR7LGG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2021",2021-11-30,United States,,"For context: I use these for listening to music during commute and leisure in an urban university level setting. I take it with me for bus rides, grocery trips/errands, and to libraries and other academic buildings. These are the type of field tests my unit has gone through that I will acknowledge in my review in regards to ANC and sound quality.I had some stuttering going on with them initially that went away when I disabled Adaptive Sound Control and DSEE Extreme. The box comes with a small USB-C charger and 3 different sizes of eartips (medium is already placed, small and large are separate in the packaging). The eartips are weird to get used to but not that unpleasant. Overall, the fit is fine, but you'll have to adjust it a little to get comfortable at first. It might feel a little uncomfortable initially, but you'll probably get used to it fairly quickly (for reference, I switched over from the Galaxy Buds 1st edition). Also, if you wear over 3 hours you might get some discomfort unless you move them around a little, but daily use during normal commute/transit is totally fine.Battery life is great, and works with wireless charging, but the charging case itself feels very plastic-y and kind of cheap, actually. It feels lighter than it actually is, like it has some hollow space? I don't know how to describe it, but it doesn't feel very sturdy. Also, the lid wiggles a little bit, but I'm not sure if that's like a quality control issue for me personally or for many other people. I might look into a case, maybe. Jury's still out on that.App is alright, but kind of a hassle sometimes. The sound quality is pretty good and the app provides an equalizer customization if that's your thing. Also, you can customize the controls a little, but I wish you could switch what tapping on the side of the earphone does, because they only give you certain combos based on the function (i.e. 'Playback Control' locks in 1 tap as play/pause, 2 taps as next track, and 3 taps as prev tracks). There are some people saying you can't pair this to multiple devices. Unless that was an issue that was patched in a software update, they're wrong. You can pair to one device initially by taking out the headphones from the case, and then pair to an additional device by holding down the touch area for 5 sec each on both earphones at the same time. It's not really explained well in the instructions, but it is possible. Of course, they cannot be used seamlessly-- you'll have to manually connect from each device which disconnects from another one, but that's different from pairing and also, for me at least, not too much of an issue.The ANC is not as great as the sound quality. Don't get me wrong-- it's pretty good, probably better than whatever else is on the market, but not as amazing as the overear headphones (WH1000XMF). It mutes out a lot of noise on public transport, such as public buses, but you will still be able to hear some things (such as the audio message for upcoming stops), and the ANC is not as effective with people's voices, so you'll definitely still be able to hear some. Also, wind noise is definitely audible.Again, it's pretty good ANC, but not as good as the headphones. You will still pick up some noise--I'd say about 25% of background noise remains, and even then, with music on 25%-40% volume you can block out most of that residual noise. Unless perfect and amazing ANC for pure silence (that is, no music) is your be-all-end-all factor of purchasing, I'd say go for it if you have the money to spend. These are certainly so much better compared to what I was using before and I don't regret purchasing it.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],1.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3339.0,904.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
4.0,SONY WF-1000XM4 VS. BOSE QC EARBUDS VS. SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS PRO,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22OFOLBVU9JAA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,220 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2021",2021-06-12,United States,,"Tested on Note 9. WF-1000XM4 (XM4), Galaxy Buds Pro (GBP), and QuietComfort Earbuds (QC).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOUND:*XM4 is a bit too much in the bass, and I couldn’t pick out details as well. Everything seemed narrow like I was really close to the speakers. Tuning via EQ and switching the foam for silicone helped bring the sound closer to what I prefer. But I'm pretty sure most people, especially if they don't A/B test, will love the XM4 sound out of the box--it's very fun.*I prefer the sound on the GBP, but they all sound really good for true wireless earbuds. I wouldn’t pick one out of the three on sound quality, alone.*Note on foam vs. silicone: XM4 sounds very narrow/bassy because of the foam. Using silicone will change the sound quality.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------COMFORT:XM4:*Can’t put foam on as easily as silicone. Once they expand, they're very secure and comfortable but can feel crowded after a while.*Supported by the ear, but there is a space between the bud and ear. Noticeable annoyance when your ear hits the buds while running.*Large and bulky (doesn’t pass the pillow test).GBP:*Silicone on the GBP is slippery w/ sweat. I know I had to adjust them every couple of minutes if I was working out.*The GBP slides in easily, and I barely feel them. They go into the ear canal a bit less than the XM4 (less invasive).*Small/flush enough to pass the pillow test, but you’ll still feel them since they go a bit deeper in the ear canal than the air pods pros. Diofit silicone ear tips are much softer than the stock tips; tremendously improved the comfort and fit.QC:*These fit the easiest by just plugging the outside of the ear canal.*But you must rotate the earbud to do so, and then the ear wing doesn’t hook onto anything; if fitted correctly, the ear wing just pushes back on the antihelix to ensure your ear canal is plugged.*Since they’re silicone, you’ll have to readjust the earbuds when sweat/earwax gets in the way.*Easiest to fall off during a rigorous head-shaking test (obviously hard to replicate in normal use though).*The biggest/bulkiest of the three (doesn’t pass the pillow test).*Note on foam vs. silicone: Foam is more secure and great when exercising. But it does feel congested over time, especially if you don’t have the right size on. Depending on the softness of the ear tip, silicone can vary in comfort and may not be the best for grip.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------USABILITY:GBP:*The GBP is very sensitive and small. Touch controls activate when you're adjusting your earbuds.*Voice-detect. Activates when I brush my teeth w/ an electric toothbrush. Yet, the GBP isn't as sensitive when you're actually talking, like saying ""hello"" which I have to repeat twice for it to work. It's useful when it works like it should, though.*Can have a volume control, playback function, and NC/ambient switch enabled if you use edge touching for volume. No passthrough.*I personally love edge touching. I can get it working by just touching my ear.XM4:*The XM4 is more polished when it comes to controls. No issues found.*The XM4, however, doesn't allow you to use NC/ambient, media playback, and volume; you must pick 2 out of the 3.*I found ditching NC/ambient/passthrough function and using the adaptive sound control, voice detection, and voice assistance (need to set up Google Assistance via the Headphones app first) to be an adequate substitute whenever you want to use ambient mode.*The adaptive sound control determines if you need ambient mode if you’re moving or if you’re in a location that you set to ambient mode. It determines this by your phone, so if you set your phone down while moving about, you’ll still be in NC.QC:*Impossible to have any accidental touches. Pause/play is double tap and the earbud itself is very big.*Can’t use both forwards/backward. Must pick one as a shortcut.*Volume slider sometimes increases/decreases too much depending on how you swipe.*Switching between NC modes is tedious. Wish there were a way to only use 2 levels, but it forces you to rotate between 3.*Note on foam vs. silicone: You have to compress foam before inserting them, so if you don’t wash your ear tips/fingers, you might run into some sanitary/durability problems. Silicone is easy to put on, very durable, and easy to clean.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOISE-CANCELLING:XM4 and Bose are comparable. I don't think it's worth trying to figure out which of the two is better in NC. The GBP is weaker, but it is still very good out in public. It also has the benefit of less cabin pressure.*Bose has 11 modes of NC from full NC to ambient mode.*XM4 has 1 NC and 20 levels of ambient mode.*GBP has 2 modes of NC, 4 of ambient sound, 2 of which amplify the environment a lot. And you can toggle hearing enhancement which is an even higher level of ambient sound. Can be good to hear more, but also makes stuff like car doors sound way too harsh.*Note on foam vs. silicone: XM4 has amazing NC because of the foam. If you can’t get a good seal and/or want to use silicone, the NC will not be as effective. The QC has stiff silicone (at least compared to the QC20), so it's a tradeoff between NC and comfort.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CASE:*XM4: Good, small case. VERY strong magnets.*GBP: Good, small case. Sometimes I mix the left and right earbuds, but the case only closes when they’re in the right place.*QC: The worst. Biggest case. Lowest battery life capacity. Weakest magnets. The latch doesn’t work if you simply press it; you must deliberately put some pressure on it and push it in.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION:Pricewise, I think the GBP offers the best value out of any noise-canceling true wireless earbuds I tried, but they don’t have an app for IOS AFAIK. The XM4 is IMO a better earbud to use (polished controls, hands-free voice assistance, better App/EQ), but I don’t know if it’s worth costing $100 more than the GBP. I don’t think the QC is worth the price unless you really like the ear tips. Regardless, if you have any of the three and are fine with them, there isn’t really a need to switch. They’re just noise-canceling true wireless earbuds--they all do the job.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT: Found my first bug with the XM4. Pausing your music or changing noise-canceling modes will cause a whooshing/pulsating effect from your right earbud to the left. Thought it was the noise-canceling trying to turn itself on via ambient sound control but turning it off didn't fix it. It's a subtle but noticeable sound with noise canceling on. With ambient mode on, it's very apparent. LATE EDIT: Found the culprit. It's LDAC/DSEE. Disabling both and using AAC only fixes it, so you'll probably have to wait for a firmware fix.EDIT2: If you use Google voice assistance (haven't tested Alexa) with the XM4 and want to use an earbud independently, you can only do that with the earbud you assigned playback functions. If you use the default voice assistance (your phone), you can use either earbud by itself but can’t use voice assistance to do playback/NC functions.LAST EDIT: Returned the XM4s. Going to be keeping the GBP as they're better to use in daily use (using the azla crystal tips RN). I think the XM4 earbud is really good if you're prioritizing on ANC while having a good package (obviously the GBP isn't the best at ANC). Now that I've been using them for a while now, I do think it's worth spending $100 more if you really want the best ANC (I don't). As for sound quality, I found that the treble preset is the best. . . . either that or the bright preset should have been the stock tuning IMO. Experiment with raising 2.5k/6.3k Hz, depending on the ear tips you use on the XM4. Maybe the 16k hz if you want some more air. As for the sound quality vs the GBP, I think they're the same if you tune them both to your liking. The LDAC/DSEE vs scalable isn't that noticeable, and the XM4's dynamic driver does well up against the GBP's subwoofer/tweeter combo. IMO, the only way to get a ""better"" sound quality earbud is to include more drivers, like your typical audiophile IEMs . . . but then, you'd be buying those instead of TWEs.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ew7VlmwcL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Ksz-92-GL._SY88.jpg']",2.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3339.0,904.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
4.0,Are they the best though??,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17J5WFLQX844M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,595 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2022",2022-10-30,United States,,"Sony is always leading the way for electronics.. that may be my personal opinion but I’ve also had Sony products since 1995 and I am the type of person that when I see a brand that works, I do not stray away.Regardless.. these are the flagship TWS earbuds around.. I am being unbiased when I say mehh… I will keep this review short.Sound quality/Call quality.. extensively great.. having the adjustable EQ, makes it so much better to enjoy music that you love. I listen a broad spectrum of music and they do not disappoint by any means. They can provide clean and clear bass when you want them to, or be bass heavy. Just slide that “Clear Bass” to the right and you’ll not be disappointed, as they still provide clean sound that’s totally not overpowered with the bass all the way up. Even at flat, the highs, mids and bass tones are natural and warm.. they are rich. Though these don’t provide a soundstage like over the ear headphones do which may be a downfall to some people. The call quality though, is to me, better than the top of the line Jabra 85T.. I have had those before myself, and was let down. People can hear me very clearly, rarely do I have to repeat myself if not at all. Voices are clear, they’re not muffled or sound far away by any means, which me being a trucker, having the cleanliness and clarity is a must have when on the road. It is very weird though, when you do receive a call, the sound changes I’ll explain that below.Sound modes.. the ANC, I hardly ever use because they seal in your ear well enough that ANC, in my case, is almost obsolete. I wear them in off mode every day.. they provide enough seal and passive noise reduction being “in ear” more than let’s say Apple AirPods Pro, that you won’t need ANC. Transparency mode is really nice to use. If I’m out and about running errands, I leave the transparency mode on so I can hear what’s around me at all times. Sometimes though, with certain sounds, or wind it can sound like you have a solo cup over your ear so not everything is going to sound clear. I usually take one out when I am talking to someone to be courteous, because they do give you a sense that you’re talking too loud when in reality you’re not talking loud enough which can make people have to ask you to repeat yourself. Overall, the ANC is great, it’s not something I use or care to truly use unless needed but it’s a great feature to have if you like to use it. Li Ike I mentioned above, it does have this sound mode that turns on when you receive a call. It’s not transparency mode, but it’s like a hear your own voice mode. For some reason the volume every time I connect these earbuds the ringer is on the lowest volume setting. The only way I know I’m receiving a call is when the sound mode changes from off, to the “hear your own voice” sound mode. It goes from hearing barely anything to like a 50% transparency mode that makes it sound like you’re in a tunnel.Battery life… This is the flagship of any earbuds… I’ve worn these for 10-12 hours some days, and with the sound mode in Off, they did not die or reach “low battery”.. I had them at 60% battery life one day, and 8 hours later the voice prompt finally said “low battery” and that was at 20% battery left in both earbuds. They do last a very long time. Mind you I have mixed usage.. music, movies, phone calls/etc, and they still have outlasted any other pair I’ve had. I cannot speak for battery length in ANC/transparency mode, but I can say that they do outlast anything.Tap control… be weary, that while they are functional, you have to tap the earbuds just right for them to recognize the functions you wish to have them perform. They seem to be proprietary to the center of the earbud, as I’ve tried tapping just outside the center and nothing happened. This may be cumbersome to a lot of people who like having tap controls.. I barely use them except to change sound modes, and play/pause whatever I’m listening to or watching at the time.Comfort… this is a let down… I’ve been wearing AirPods Pro’s since they came out. To me, they are the most comfortable earbuds I’ve had. And I declare that to Apples design of the tips and earbuds to your ears rather than having an eartip contour or expand your ear canal to fit.. while these do have comfort, the foam tips, they aren’t gonna last long and while they provide comfort, it’s just not enough. I ordered a pair of Eartune U-Ellipitical eartips that changed everything. To anyone looking for better eartips, the Eartunes are what you need, as they are designed with a more oval shape to contour to the ear canal a lot better. With the ear tip change, they will however, these earbuds still provide discomfort elsewhere.. where they sit in your ear overtime will cause a burning sensation.. the first few days wearing them I had to take them out after a few hours because my ear canal, and the area where these sit were making my ears burn pretty bad.. I still have some days where I feel some burning, it’s not as bad but it’s still enough where I find myself taking them out for a while to give my ears some relief, and that’s where a lot of other earbuds may prevail in comfort compared to these.Overall, if you’re a sound guy, you want top of the line ANC, and a superior battery life and can live with small discomforts.. I highly recommend these for you and they will not disappoint. For those who are looking for an alternative in comfort and comfort being a priority, compared to the Apple AirPods Pro’s, or equally comfortable earbuds, these are not for you.. while the pros may trump the downfall in regards to the small issues in comfort, the comfort may trump the pros for others. Please understand I changed eartips to one’s more similar to the Airpods, but still experienced discomfort. If you’re looking for a balance of everything a TWS can offer/may have to offer, these are definitely a great pair, I just think that maybe the price should be a tad bit lower and I would wait for the next time they go on sale.Update - 12/5/22After doing some research I found a set of eartips that I recommend for these, Eartune Fidelity U-Ellipse. I highly recommend these to a seriously great extent because they have changed the game for me, and I can comfortably wear the WF-1000XM4s over 10 hours without any issues of burning, itchy or etc. If you purchase these earbuds and the eartips above, you will not be looking for another pair of earbuds for quite some time.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],3.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3339.0,904.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
4.0,"Tricky to handle, but solid performance",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWMACLG63HOS6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,68 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2022",2022-07-24,United States,,"My experience with true wireless earbuds like this had previously been limited to a gifted pair of Skullcandy earbuds that retailed for less than 1/3 of what Sony asks for these.  Suffice it to say, those did not give me a good impression of this still somewhat new form factor for earbuds.  Their sound quality was atrocious (think sub-telephone quality audio, plus constant dropouts if the device they're connected to is anywhere but within eyesight.)  They had a tendency to activate themselves while in the charging case, draining both the earbud batteries, the case's battery, and also causing me to miss audible notifications because it cut the phone speaker off.  But despite the issues, the true wireless form factor was something that intrigued me, so I saved up and waited for these highly-rated Sony units to go on sale.  Now that I have them, are they worth the higher cost or are they just as troublesome as the cheapies?Long story short: YES. These are head and shoulders better than those cheap trash buds, as they should be.  But do they justify the high cost compared to so many lesser brand competitors?  I think they do.  The sound quality is impressive (if not top of the line), and the noise cancelling works very well, especially if you can get a proper fit with one of the ear tip sets included with the purchase.First, sound quality.  My personal ""gold standard"" reference headphones are my beloved Sennheiser HD 600, an open-backed mid-level home audio headphone.  They are a little low on bass but otherwise have superbly flat audio characteristics.  These Sony earbuds don't quite match the Sennheiser 'phones for overall quality, but they are far from poor performers.  They're a little bright and midrange-y for my tastes, but this isn't bad for most kinds of music or speech programming, in my opinion.  When they're snug in the ear canal they also offer a surprisingly good amount of bass.  They won't make your skull vibrate if you're a bass-head, but they can offer clean and punchy bass and pretty moderate volume levels, especially if you tweak the EQ in the available Headphones app for smartphones.  On my Pixel 6 Pro, they connect in ""HD audio mode -- LDAC"" for increased sound quality.  I hate that they don't seem to support aptX or aptX low latency, though, so these may not be suitable for watching videos on a TV.Second, noise cancelling.  My main reference are a budget pair of Anker Soundcore Q20s, another over the ear headphone that's often available for $50 or less.  Despite their low cost, I think their noise cancelling is as good as the $400 Sony or Bose models that rate so highly.  Like, 90% that good for 1/8th cost.  So that's a pretty high bar.  These true wireless ear buds, sadly, don't quite work that well in this regard.  That said, they are far from poor performers in this regard.  They will reduce a LOT of background noise, especially when tightly fitted to your ears.  These are definitely geared more towards the typical ""transportation noise"" reduction, like the drone of a car or a plane's jet engine.  They work less well on higher-pitched sounds like the click-clack of a mechanical keyboard or chattering co-workers one cubicle over.  But, that's pretty typical of most noise cancelling headphones, regardless of style.Battery life, so far, seems adequate for my light use needs.  I think I'm seeing about a 40% drop in earbud life after an hour's use, and that is topped back up by the case in less than half an hour of charging.  I've used them for several hours so far and the case's battery life is still over 80% so it should last several months of my sporadic use.As for complains and issues, they are few.  The main gripe I have with these is how hard they are to remove from the case.  The case is slick, hard plastic, and fairly compact, and the ear buds are held in place by pretty strong magnets.  The ear buds are also slick plastic so it's hard for my ham hands to get a good grip on them.Getting a good fit is a little hard for me, too.  Neither the small nor medium ear tips gave me a good seal, and the large ones are a little TOO big so they are tight even when they're not properly seated in my ears.  But, once I do shove them in (twisting them in place is what they recommend) they seal fairly good, at least in my left ear.  My right ear is still a little loose fitting, so it takes so fiddling to get it just right.The touch sensitive pads on each ear bud are easy to accidentally tap while getting them fitted properly, too.  Once they're in place, though, the gentle tap controls work really well.The one other issue I've experienced is that only one earbud has connected, so I got mono audio through both earbuds!  The only way to fix it was to put them back in the case, which I didn't have with me, so I had to do a listening session only hearing half the audio.  So far it's only happened once, but it was super annoying.The Headphones app is necessary to unlock the full functionality of these earbuds. Not only can you manually pick the mode (noise cancelling on/off, or ambient mode on/off) you can also set the level of amplification used in the ambient mode.  There's an EQ with various presets and two custom slots for you to use as you want.  There's also a bass boost option and displays for battery life of each earbud and the case.  If you want to access some other features, like some silly social media type deal and a feature that automatically changes modes based on your usage patterns, you'll need a Sony account.  There's also some settings for 360° audio that require taking pictures of your ears and using specific apps like Spotify or Tidal, but again these are optional and not necessary to really get the most out of these earbuds.Overall, they're a pretty good set of earbuds, and at least in my opinion, worth the cost when they go on sale.  If you try them, be sure to try all three sets of ear tip cushions and use the Headphone app's test tool, it will help you find which ones will work best.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6106948gSrL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EUSQG34gL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XwQCr5CyL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+K9lOIbZL._SY88.jpg']",4.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3339.0,904.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
4.0,"A good set of wireless NC earbuds, but somewhat large and pricey",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3COJNP4QA8ZF0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,53 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2022",2022-10-27,United States,,"In addition to being a headphone addict, I was looking for another option for a quality set of  wireless NC ear buds for air travel.  Currently I use over-the-ear Sony WH1000XM (original V1) OR Bose Wired in ear QC20's.  Both sound good and have very good noise cancelling.  However, I wanted to reduce the bulk while traveling and have an option to go wireless as my new phone does not have an audio jack.  Enter this review, and my comparison between the Sony WF 1000XM4's and the Google Pixel Buds Pro (PBP).In this review, I used a 0- or 1-point system with 1 point for the winner, 0 points for the loser and 1 point for each for a tie.If you don't want to read through the comparison, just get the PBP's.  These two earbuds are very close in features, sound quality and noise cancelling, but the PBP's are cheaper and still beat out the Sony's based on my scoring...and I really love the Sony’s but cannot justify them for the price difference!For my smaller ears the Sony's were a bit more uncomfortable. Ultimately both are really good ear buds, and it comes down to a matter of fit and price (at least for me).  If price is not an option and you have larger ears go with Sony, otherwise go with the Pixel Buds Pro.Detailed reviewPrice: Both were purchased on sale, so the Sony's were $250 (regularly $280) and the PBP's were $150 (regularly $199).  In my opinion, PBP's are a bargain compared to the Sony's!  Winner: PBPFit: PBP smaller and lighter.  Sony, foam tips seal well, but can be scratchy in the ear and feel hotter.  For my smaller ears the PBP's were just more comfortable. Winner: PBPNoise Cancelling: Sony is better with NC and foam tips.  PBP's not far behind though. With proper ear tips, the Sony's will block out slightly more noise in air travel.  In the office, it is also close, but some of the higher pitched sounds will make it through on the PBP's.  Overall, it is pretty close given the cost difference between the two, and Sony's reputation for Noise cancelling. Winner: SonyBass -no/flat EQ: Both are bass heavy buds. Winner: TieMid - no/flat EQ: Both have OK Mids. Sony's seem slightly more subdued, but both were pretty muddy without some EQ help.  The PBP's treble boost may also help the MIDs come out a little more but its too close to call. Winner: TieHigh - no/flat EQ: PBP have an accentuated high-range making music a little brighter but can get shrill.  The Sony's highs were a little dull making for an overall slightly subdued sound Winner: PBPOverall sound no/flat EQ: Sony's sound slightly cleaner out of the box without the EQ, but the two are close.  They both need some EQ help to go from good to great sounding buds. Winner: SonyOverall Sound W/EQ: With some EQ adjustments both can be closely matched.  Sony needs a treble bump, PBP's need treble reduced.  Both need the mid’s bumped slightly. Winner: TieTouch Controls: PBP has more controls available at once.  Both can be changed in the apps, but with Sony you must choose between music control or volume control.  The PBP's can do both with taps or swipes. Both will pause music when the earbuds are removed. Winner: PBPControl feedback: Sony's have spoken audio queue's, PBP's use beeps.  Much easier to know what you changed with spoken responses by the Sony's. Winner: SonyVolume level: At the same volume settings, the Sony's were louder.  For the PBP's it seemed I needed to play these near max volume.  Could be a phone issue, but all volume and app settings were the same for both. This bothered me enough to almost make me not want to keep the PBP's. Winner: SonyBattery Life (ANC on): Sony's seem to have a slight edge, but only by a few minutes. Too close to call Winner: TieCharging: Both have USB C and Wireless charging and charge in approximately the same amount of time.  Number of charges and quick charging (5-minute charge for an hour of play) is the same per the specs. I have not tried this out yet as I always keep these charged. Winner: TieMultipoint (pairing): Sony does not allow you to pair and use with two Bluetooth devices at the same time.  The PBP's do. Shame on Sony for not including this for the price of these headphones. Great feature for office use! Winner: PBPApp: Both apps are well done.  The PBP app is a little easier to use. Both have ear tip check feature which will tell you if you ear tips are sealing well.  I used a smaller tip in one ear and both apps detected a bad seal. Winner: TieCharging Case size: Both are small, but the PBP's have slimmer case and feels better when carried in the pocket. Winner: PBPAssistant features: Both are capable of using Google assistant or Alexa..Yes, the PBPs will work with Alexa Winner: TieAuto Ambient Switch: Only available on the Sony.  If it senses you are talking it will automatically switch to ambient sound pass through and pause your music.  Very useful feature and works well especially on an airplane.  However, if you like to sing out loud you probably want to disable this feature.  Winner: SonyFind my headphones: Only available on the PBPs. You can send a signal and make the buds beep if you misplace them. Winner: PBPBluetooth: Both connect instantly and have great range.  Walking to the other side of my house and through about 3 walls, both ear buds cut out in the exact same location. Winner: TieMicrophone: Did not really test this, based on the soundguys.com review they are close, but in their recorded audio the PBP's mic sounds a bit better to my ear than the Sony's.

4.0,ANC: Good. Sound Quality: Very Good - Updated,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33X7YICIUITL7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2021",2021-12-09,United States,,"Over the years, I've owned a number of noise-cancelling ""headphones"". The three I currently own are the:Audio-Technica ATH-ANC33iS ANC In-Ear HeadphonesBose Noise Cancelling Headphones NC 700Sony WF-1000XM4 EarbudsAlthough this review will focus on the Sony earbuds, I'll be making a variety of comparisons to the other two.Noise Cancelling (ANC)None of these devices will put you into a noise-free bubble. Babies crying? Forget it. Subways, heavy street traffic? Some, maybe significant, reduction. Jackhammers? Run, don't walk away.Second, with the exception of ANC headphones (like the Bose), take any analyses you read with a grain of salt. The noise-cancelling that comes from the ear tips for ear buds & earphones constitute a major part (50%?) of the noise cancelling. Only technical comparisons of the ANC headphones can be taken seriously since, although heads & ears do vary in shape, almost everything depends on the ear muffs and tech inside.So how good is the Sony? It's hard to choose between the Bose and the Sony. When I get a superb fit with the latter, the ear buds actually perform better out on the street than the Bose headphones, but I cannot overemphasize how important ""fit"" is. The Audio-Technica ranks third. With the ATH, I often must increase the volume when, for example, traffic is heavy. That isn't necessary with either the Sony or Bose. Furthermore, on windy days, the ANC in the ATH actually increases the volume of the wind. Wind barely affects the Sony (even without the wind noise adjustment via the App) and has no effect on the Bose.Ear TipsThere's no way any review can assure you that a set of ear tips will work best for you. Fit is a very personal matter. Between the AHC and the Sony, I've probably spent over $50 on ear tips of various kinds. I've found that triple-flange ear tips work best for me, and because they will work with both the Sony and the AHC, I've been able to make fair comparisons between the two.Sound QualityI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to podcasts, but I do occasionally listen to music and was blown away by the sound quality of the Sony. The Bose is pretty much on a par. There's nothing especially noteworthy about the ATH's sound quality.Comfort:It's hard to say which are more uncomfortable: the Bose or the Sony. The Bose headphones are very heavy and make one's ears sweat after a while. An hour is about all I can take. Pretty much the same is true of the Sony. They won't make your ears sweat, but after even 30 minutes, I want to remove them. I can, and have, worn the ATH for an entire day.Battery Life:I don't care all that much how long the battery will last as whether or not I can still listen to a podcast or music if the battery is dead.Both the Bose and the ATH will work even with a dead battery. The ANC won't work, but you can still listen. And since the ATH uses a AAA battery, you can simply make sure you've always got one in a pocket or purse. The Sony doesn't work at all if the battery is dead.Sony Headphones Connect AppYou need this app to take advantage of the Sony ear buds. And it is a disaster. There is no ""manual"" per se, but an internet-based collection of hyperlinks that is hard to navigate intuitively. And the app's design is, shall we say, less than intuitive.You can't even access the app if you are not wearing the ear buds, or if they are not at least close to the device running the app.To test the fit of the earbuds (an excellent idea), instead of going to the sound tab (the logical place), you must go to ""system tab"". The sound level of the fit test is unbelievably loud. While testing various ear tips, I must have run this at least 20 times and fear for my hearing. There is no way to lower the volume level of the test.Some tips to get the best out of the noise-cancelling:1. Set the Adaptive Sound Control off.2. Under the Sound Tab, set the Ambient Level to zero.Finally, you can change, within limits, what options are available via taps on the ear buds, but this is critical: on the right ear bud you can control volume OR you can control play (next track), but you must make the selection in the app and you cannot do both.Bottom Line: the Sony WF-1000XM4 does what it is designed to do and does it well. Whether it is comfortable enough for you to wear for hours is something I can't advise you on.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],6.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3339.0,904.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds

I accidentally engage the touch controls when I practice yoga, when I put on a hat, and even when my wet hair brushes against them.

I would say the quality of sound is pretty good with a little background noise. The noise canceling is a bit of a joke if you ask me. Nothing like the pair of old school Bose headphones I had with noise canceling (The ones with the neck bracellete and two wired head ohones coming of the neck band deal). Ypu can turn the noise canceling on and off with the left bud by tapping it with your finger, but the noise canceling is not impressive.The only other down side is that the buds hurt my ears for about a week, maybe two before my ears adjusted to them. I wear them all day, answering phone calls and listening to some kind of media content.Positives are the sound quality is pretty good.Before the buds ""shaped my ears"" they fell from my ears many times and did not sustain damages. One time, one fell out and landed in a bucket of latex paint. Miraculously the bud survived. I let it dry out and peeled off the paint. The buds sound outlet actually has a protective, soft mesh that prevemted the paint from getting into the ear bud. Sure enough, while I cleaned the ear bud I could hear music turning on and off as I got it all polished up. They still worked perfectly.No a days I'm much more careful with them.I attend to the possibilty of a potentially loosening bud.The case is awesome. Never completely drained it. On a full charge I've easily listened to 12-14 hrs over two days, probably 16hrs.The case is magnetic and give a satisfying snap when it closes. There is a battery life indicator ligjt on the case and the ear buds themselves tell you how much battery lige is left when you take them out of the case ans plug them into ears(each ear bud reports it's charge independently via voice through the speaker).They are a bit bulky but after some nasty stinging in my ears when touched from the duration of use early on, these ear buds are bomb. Never leave home without them except on my days off. Well worth the money and worth the short period of break in  discomfort.Noise canceling is so-so.

(Let’s just call it brand J.) But my dog found the right-side bud laying on the carpet and dismantled it. Without the right-side bud, the left one is useless. Brand J makes great buds, but I heard the Sony WF-1000XM4 buds had better sound quality. So, I bought a pair of Sony buds, and I’m glad I did.The Sony buds come with three sizes of replacement tips; however, I ordered rubber replacement tips from a third-party vendor because the originals are made of foam, which in my experience is more difficult to clean and has to be replaced too frequently.I noticed right away that the bluetooth reception range on the Sony buds is shorter than on brand J. This is important to me at home when I listen to podcasts and audio books. With brand J, I can leave the phone in my room and go out to the kitchen or the living room without losing the signal. But with the Sony buds, I have to carry the phone with me all the time in order to keep the signal from dropping out. Even line-of-sight outdoors, the difference in reception distance is marked. I’ve learned simply to never walk away from my phone when I’m connected, and that resolves the issue. For me, it’s worth the trouble because of Sony’s superior sound quality.Sony has an app for the phone that allows for EQ customization as well as access to a number of convenience features. My favorite is the feature that allows me to designate when and where the buds will automatically switch between Noise Cancelling and Ambient Sound. For example, I know that when I’m out walking the dog I want to be able to hear all the street noises around me. Therefore, because I set it that way, when the phone senses I’m moving it switches to Ambient Sound. I can also adjust settings instructing the buds to change sound dynamics when I arrive at specific locations.There is one issue that really annoys me. First, I don’t normally take the bud charger along when I do errands around town. Most of the time I can listen to media through my buds then seamlessly transition to the car’s audio player. And when I get out of the car to go into a store, the buds usually connect to the phone again within a few seconds after putting them back in my ears. But every now and then the buds fail to connect when I turn off the car engine. In that case, I have to  go through the steps of placing them back in the charger then immediately taking them out and putting them in my ears. If I don’t have the charger with me, I’m required to shut off power to the buds, plus turn off blue tooth before starting from scratch again. Maybe I’ll just make it a habit to carry my charger whenever I go for a drive. The Sony charger is slightly larger than Brand J’s charger, but carrying them around is still doable.The Sony buds are larger and heavier than brand J buds as well, but they feel just as comfortable in my ears. And if I want to change to a different mode on the buds, all I have to do is tap. With brand J, I had to press on the buds which pushed them deeper into my ear.I also like the Sony voice that speaks when I change modes. It’s nice and pleasant, and sounds like I’m listening to a National Public Radio broadcaster. The brand J voice sounds like someone talking to me on a Ham radio set.You can’t go wrong with these Sony buds. They were at the top end of my earbud budget, but they were certainly worth the money. And if my dog should some day eat one of my Sony buds, the other one will continue to work independently.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],10.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3339.0,904.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
2.0,Not the Airpods Pro Killer I was hoping for,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24SDL8M1D6MI8?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,18 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021",2021-06-11,United States,,"********************* Update *******************************I returned them because I did not find the improvements in sound quality worth the many sacrifices when compared to my Airpods Pro.In my original review I had also mentioned that the Sony had better battery life, but with LDAC turned ON it's only about 5 hours--not the 8 hours claimed by Sony, which is just a hair longer than the Airpods Pro. Plus, they both have fast charging making the impact of a longer battery life less significant.Finally, Sony failed to fix the ambient noise issue--both with the fading in and out and the general poor performance. If ambient mode is important to you Apple is still for some reason untouchable. I don't understand why the other trillion dollar corporations can't figure out such a simple feature. It's just microphones right? Sound quality and ANC are understandably difficult, but ambient mode should be easy.Everything from the original review below still applies.********************* Original review ************************I am an android user with Airpods Pro and the WH-1000XM3s (large over ear headphones). The Airpods Pro are still an overall better product but the Sonys do excel in a couple of key areas such as battery life and sound quality.Airpods Pro: Significantly more comfortable, far superior controls, usable ambient sound mode, and much cheaperWF-1000XM4s: Better sound quality, better battery life, great appToss ups: ANC (better on the XM4s but not by much)********************* Bit more detail ************************Noise canceling: ANC is better than the Airpods Pro but not by much. I think a lot of the people gushing over the ANC are either experiencing it for the first time or comparing it to headphones where ANC was not a top concern. If you're coming from Bose, Apple or even last gen Sony, you should vastly lower your expectations.Audio Quality: Far better than the Airpods Pro. The sound that comes out of these is simply unbelievable. In typical Sony fashion, they are a bit bass boosted, but you can easily fix that with the full EQ in the app. They can also get very loud.App: The app is excellent. It always connected to the buds and allows decent customization of the buds from sound quality to button layout, voice assistant, etc. I wish there were more options with button layout. Currently, there are only function groups and each bud can only be configured with one group, not individual button configurations. For example, ambient noise layout has ambient noise on/off with single tap. You cannot also add media controls to that bud nor change input for ambient noise from single tap to long press.Controls: These have touch control that are just alright. Touching them on the edges to adjust them in your ear will not trigger false inputs, which is good, but this also means that you have to be very precise and hit them right in the center to get them to respond. Plus, you have to tap them somewhat forcefully to trigger, which reverbs the noise in your ear like a gong. Often, I have issues activating skip forward and backwards, which requires multiple taps. The buds only register the first tap and ignore the rest, so it just pauses music instead of skipping songs. I also have long hair at the moment and sometimes my hair will trigger the buds, either pausing music or turning on ambient noise, which is very annoying. The force touch controls on the Airpods Pro are far, far superior.Comfort: My biggest issue. The XM4s are really large and designed to sit in your ear unlike the previous generation. Plus, the foam tips, although great for noise isolation, are lousy when paired with this in-ear design. Basically, every time you smile or open your mouth or clench your jaw, or breathe deeply, or do anything at all, your ears deform a bit, which pushes the hard plastic of the buds, which pushes the dense foam out of place. So, I'm constantly fidgeting with the fit. The XM4s are not something you can wear for an extended period of time. I am used to constant pain and suffering but still I can bear at most half an hour before I have to take the Sonys out. The Airpods Pro have a controversial design, but Apply really nailed the comfort factor.Ambient sound: The XM4s have a cool feature where they will automatically go into Ambient sound mode when you start speaking. This feature did work fairly reliably for me, but you have to speak loudly to trigger it and it wasn't always perfect. Sometimes, it will trigger with a cough or a sneeze. In any case, this feature is moot because Sony messed up really bad with Ambient Sound. There is constant loud static, people speaking sound unnatural and your ears still feel plugged up. Imagine sticking your head inside a metal bucket with a loud fan buzzing inside. That's what Ambient sound is like with the XM4s. Again, Apple really nailed this feature and if you regularly have conversations with people (both with phone calls and IRL) while wearing earbuds, get the Airpods Pro.Call Quality: I was only able to test in a quiet environment but people didn't seem to have a preference. They did mention that on the XM4s I sounded farther away than with the Airpods Pro. However, I still prefer the Airpods Pro for calls because of the superior ambient sound mode.

These things so good and so bad.  Still with custom equalization best sound I've heard in buds, especially bass which should be enough to make me overlook everything else yet I can't.  I don't put them in to the sound cause of all the other problems.  I have constant connection problems with them.  Shocked to find I can only make one connection with them.  Really ? at this price I should get 15 connections.  The case I keep coming back to cause I use so many other buds and cases that this this one is a SHINING BEACON OF SUCKINESS.  It is cheap and big and unusable.  I dread opening the case and trying to get the buds out.  How on earth did they ever ship this product with this case ? $300 sound wrapped in a 50 cent case which protects them from..........USE.And they are huge, bulky, miserable looking, hard to put in your ears, there just is NOTHING good about these but the equalized sound and the ability if you want it to have booming  bass.  The noise cancelling is good for buds too but at the cost of hear through is is pretty noise cancelled unfortunately.Do not pay big $ for these.  Get them cheap if your ears are big and you crave great sound.  I crave great sound thought I'd reach for these despite their massive shortcomings.  Alas, I do not.  AVOID.Oh and the packaging ? people complain that it is cheap.  All of these should be like this.  The money wasted on packaging of ear buds is absolutely Apple level bad.  I want a cardboard box which I can recycle as I don't need an ""unboxing experience"".  If you want that, buy some nice boxes and quit burning money which should be put into the product.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Sure wanted to love these but they fall far short.  The sound ? great.  The bass is amazing for ear buds and I assume it is cause of the foam tips rather than the usual rubbery ones.  First set in my ears with foam since Shure E3Cs.  Unfortunately, even with the smallest foams these are uncomfortable to stick in my ears.  Remind me of the Jabra 85t which are just too big.  These are also in general rather huge.  Some might like this, I do not.  I want these to tuck into my ears not stick out a 1/4 to 1/2"". When rotated into place, they do stay in my ears which is nice.  Many smaller which fit much better will not stay.  The app sucks.  Not a fan of  just tapping on the surface for controls, I much prefer buttons, full size button on each ear can work.  For these tap models, the taps do work well.  What else ?  the case ?  it, like the ear buds is HUGE, awkward, and cheap feeling plastic.  I'd over look this too if everything else was great.  It ain't.  Biggest case problem ? try pulling the earbuds out of the case ? EPIC FAIL.  Did no one ever try this ? I have 5 different cases here on my desk from just the last 6 months and this is the only one where you have any trouble pulling the buds out of the case.  THE ONLY ONE.  Real PITA.  More ? the big copper looking mics on each ear ? butt ugly.  I think they think they are cool.  They are not.  The magnets are nice and strong so returning the buds to the case goes better than average but trying to take them back out is still very difficult.  This alone is a deal breaker.  Did I mention the case just feels like it is from a $30 set of buds ?  I got the refurbs for $120.  For that these work.  If I paid $300 for these I'd feel totally ripped off.

2.0,Great - When All Conditions Are Met,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLB9T4RF50CDR?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2022",2022-08-16,United States,,"The sound on these earbuds is nearly unrivalled (seriously, when these work perfectly, the sound is phenomenal)... under strict conditions.  These are not as user friendly as AirPods.  I had to send first pair back as their was considerable unnecessary sound in noise cancelling mode, and some other issues.  I returned the second set due to the following issues:* The headphones are better on a newer Android device than an iPhone.  The audio on my iPhone 13 Pro vs a Samsung Ultra 22 (might be wrong on that iteration), was not nearly as good.* No multipoint Bluetooth, an issue I did not think was a problem until I actually got these in hand.* Microphone quality is atrocious, and this point right here is why I no longer own these buds.  It picks up way too much background noise. If I am in an outdoor environment of any type, and god forbid a mall or restaurant, I cannot use these earbuds, I have to go into handheld mode, every time.  Everything else I can forgive, but not this.  I have a 5 year old set of $20 cheapo earbuds that have quality 10x better than these in the microphone department. These cost 250$.  I cannot overstate how bad the mic quality is, and why would anyone by wireless earbuds these days with a bad mic? I don't even use the phone very much at all, but when I do, and every single person I speak to tells me they cannot understand me, there's a problem.* I have big ears, like two Cadillac doors left wide open kinda big.  These earbuds are nearly too bulky even for me.  If you are smaller, like my wife, even with the smallest of the ear tips. you are not going to have a good time.  The are very top-heavy.* Active Noise Cancelling has a lot of underlying noise (static).  This feature on these, like the audio quality, is phenomenal when it works the way it's intended, but any variables seem to cause issues.  In a setting like an airplane where the noise is at a consistent predictable level, they are flawless. ANC mode with, say, traffic, or in a mall, where noise levels are up and down, there is a lot of underlying static, popping, and hum. Often quite distracting unless I have loud music on (and I like walking with noise cancelling just for the quiet).  For comparison, my AirPod Pros did not quiet background noise nearly as far as the Sony earbuds, but was able to handle inconsistent or variable noise much more efficiently, and I never ever had any underlying noise that as loud enough to be a bother.PROS:* When the sound is great, it's the BEST earbuds I've ever listened to.  It's not close, these are that good.* Ambient Noise is better than Apple's.  When I turn Ambient noise on max, I can hear people talking across a very large room very well.  The Sony's even focus on actual voices extremely well.  My Airpod Pros in Apple's transparency mode, or hearing aid mode, whichever it is, was not nearly these good.* The buds feel solid and well built.  AirPods always feel a little cheap and plastic to me. Exact opposite for the case though, the cover is so thing I swear if I owned it for much longer I would crack it.* Sony's software for these is great, with a lot of options.  The equalizer mode with clear bass boost is pretty awesome.

From my teen years I've had everything from the iconic Walkman, to CD players, and even an MD player (which most of the readers probably haven't seen). I also have the WH-1000XM3 which I'm pretty satisfied with, and the wired MDR7506 which has blown my mind away for the price. I even have the competitor’s noise-cancelling earbuds (price at the same amount as these), but I love Sony’s products that much I wanted to own this too.This, however... was a BIG disappointment!Starting with the positives: the design is stunningly beautiful, and the fit, using the memory foam pads is excellent. The comfort is also very good, but I didn’t have these for more than 2 hours since I got a big disappointment right away. The pairing process is quite easy and can be done in seconds. The sound quality is fine, and noise-cancelling is good, but to be honest, I couldn’t detect huge advantages over the competitor’s buds, which were released a year ago. Also, more below on some negatives on the quality of sound while paired to my PC.Now the not so good stuff:The unboxing experience gets as dull as it could be. Sony’s mentioning environmental reasons for it, but the box feels like super-cheap paper put together to save cost. Well, I don’t care about boxes, so I moved on.This is the real reason I had to return the product: This device can only be paired with a SINGLE device, and yes, Sony apparently meant it! When you pair these buds to, let’s say, your phone, they become invisible to other Bluetooth devices. I tried to turn the Bluetooth off my phone, and the buds wouldn’t be discovered still. I even turned off my phone, with no avail. The only way I could connect these to my PC, or any other device, was to unpair them first from my cell phone. Honestly, this feels like a slap in the face for such expensive earbuds. I have the competitor’s buds which are priced exactly as the same as these ones, and have no problem pairing them to my PC, tablet, and laptop.The second point, which was quite disappointing was this: I use an equalizer in my PC, and I’ve had no problem listening to music while boosting sound a little on my PC, using even the no-brand wireless earbuds available on Amazon. While Sony’s earbuds did perform OK without the equalizer, they miserably failed with even slightest increase in sound volume from my equalizer. Again, not only the competitor earbuds (launched a year ago) have no problem handling such output levels, but also the cheap, no-brand earbuds (mine was $50) have had ZERO problems playing music at these levels.Overall, get it if you use only one device, want great ANC and are loyal to Sony.

They clearly put very little effort into designing it. But whatever. As long as the headphones work well, right?Pros:They seem to have good sound.Meh:The noise cancellation doesn't seem to be any better than my AirPods Pro or Bose QC earbuds, but it is a little better than my Sennheiser Momentum 2 earbuds.Cons (in no particular order):1) I couldn't figure out how to get these things in my ears. Turns out, you have to twist them around like crazy, slowly wiggling them into place. I feel like I have average ears, as I usually use medium ear tips (sometimes small), but I couldn't even get these in my ears with the medium tips. Once in (small), my ears were instantly aching.2) It was hard to get a good seal, without which you can't hope for good sound or noise cancellation.3) They didn't keep their seal, and I'd imagine they'd just fall out. Just casually walking around, they were unseated within a couple minutes. It then took another couple minutes to get it back in my ear, with a good seal. I should note: not a single one of my earbuds can maintain a good seal, with my ears. My AirPods, which are my go to earbuds, call lose their seal, or even fall out completely, if I'm not using 3rd party ""ear hooks"" to hold them in, at which point they hold their seal virtually perfectly.4) The charging case is a joke. It feels super flimsy and it doesn't open very wide, making it extremely difficult to get in there and pull the earbuds out, for people with large hands (like myself), and I legitimately worry that I'll break the hinge one of these times in an attempt. The case is also relatively difficult to close - not a big deal, but I noticed I couldn't close it 1-handed, while it laid on my desk, which is just a little annoying.5) I love the idea of the dynamic noise cancellation settings, based on location. However, any time you go shopping or anything at a location that you haven't manually added to your location list, it keeps changing between the ""sitting still"" and ""walking"" settings, every time you stop/start walking again, which was really annoying.6) The foam ear tips are terrible. They're likely largely the cause of both the sealing issues and discomfort. Also, it seems like earwax is difficult to remove entirely (I think my ears are relatively clean, but I could feel that they left a slight ""residue"", for lack of a better word - similar to touching glass or something, leaving oils from your skin on it.7) Largely due to the seal/fit, I found myself legitimately experiencing anxiety every time I went to push on the earbuds to change tracks or noise cancellation mode, because it was extremely likely that I'd break the seal, and get to spend another minute or two trying to fix it. Also, at least the only way I could get them to fit, they sat at a weird angle, making finding/pressing the center difficult.Untested:I only used them for about 30 minutes (15 while shopping, 15 sitting at home) - by the end of which I was so annoyed with them I just took them out, preferring to simply not have my music at all, rather than deal with these headphones. So...1) I haven't had time to compare the sound and noise cancellation with my other earbuds, aside from memory.2) I haven't tried out their 3d sound feature.3) I can't attest to battery life or long-term comfort.Some 3rd party silicone headphones might address some of the seal/fit/comfort issues, but I'm not going to spend any more money on these.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],5.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,1104.0,752.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
2.0,Super Disappointed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SNSNOCWSRTSW?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023",2023-03-22,United States,,"I just want express my disappointment in my Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds after less than a year. I want to start by saying that for at least two years prior, I think maybe three years. I had the Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds and I absolutely LOVED them! I had recommended them to everyone I possibly could. They were without a doubt the BEST true wireless Bluetooth earbud I had ever experienced. The only reason I upgraded to the new version is because my old ones were stolen when my car was broken into. I was devastated but ultimately, I didn’t hesitate to purchase them when I noticed that they were discounted as part of prime day on amazon this summer although when I initially looked I was just going to spend the money because I thought it would have been well worth it. I had had no problem with my Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds, and I imagined that they could only get better with a new design and even better technology. At this point I have decided I am was sorely mistaken and should have purchased the ones I already loved but I was nervous that with software updates for the new version they wouldn’t work as well because that seems to be a common theme in tech. After less than a year I am experiencing connectivity issues with every single use. Sometimes it sounds like they are connecting and reconnecting all the time. Other times it is just random pauses in my music or podcast sporadically and I have even tried to see if it was my phone or my Spotify but when I connect other headphones as a test, I don’t have the same problem. There are also times where after I have been using the earbuds for a while and I put them in the case they don’t automatically disconnect so the next time I go to play music or a video out loud my phone will say that its connected to the earbuds still. With this problem I have also tried to assume that it was my phone causing the problem but I have gotten a new phone since this problem first showed up and I am still experiencing the same thing. The ear tips, while I do understand that they are supposed to support the incredible sound proofing, aesthetically they are horrific, they seem to hold onto any ear debris more than any other earbud. And I promise that my experience is not all negative, I love the redesigned smaller case, although it does feel lighter and cheaper. And I still love the champagne/gold color! it is just insanely disheartening to have so much faith in a product and brand, recommend something to everyone you can and then be so personally disappointed in the “upgraded” version of the product. Since my first pair of Sony headphones everyone has always told me that I just wanted to be different and not use air pods or beats but I genuinely believe that the quality and style of Sony products was just way more worth the price tag and I commend paying for quality sound over just the popularity of what everyone else decides is amazing.  Maybe my set of Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds are just an unfortunate one off and I hope so because I want to continue to put my money and words behind Sony but the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds have really let me down.",True,Color: SilverPattern: Headphones,[],6.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,1104.0,752.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
2.0,Super Weird.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YZFPWW7WXQ0J?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2022",2022-09-17,United States,,"I swapped a pair of Samsung Buds Pro 2s for these, so I can make a pretty good immediate comparison.The bottom line is that the audio quality of music on the WF-1000XM4s is distinctly average. Turning on the proprietary Sony LDAC Codec and using a  high-res streaming service like Tidal or Qobuz helps, but I still do not consider these to be a true audiophile experience.Are they better than the $20 pair of ear buds that you buy in the airport? Sure. But not by so much that their high price can be justified. They are somewhat flat, overly bright, and two dimensional. Using the ""Bright,"" and  ""Excited"" pre-set equalizer modes is like driving a chisel into your ear. Stick with the relatively dull and uninspiring ""Off"" mode. Compared to the Samsung Buds 2 Pro, this set of ear buds sounds merely average.Another significant issue for me (though it might not be for you) is that it's incredibly difficult to get an airtight fit on the buds. This is important for listening to music and essential for the noise canceling feature. The only way for me to get such a fit is to have the buds cranked so far down that they are practically falling out of my ears. And it takes two or three minutes to get them properly in place every time I use them. Again, this might simply be a matter of the shape of my ears...but I have had no such problems with other ear buds. I do suspect that it is the result of the relatively flimsy foam material that Sony uses as the connection point to your ear canal - though it could also be the odd shape of the device itself.So what do they do well? As advertised, the active noise canceling is pretty decent. The comfort level seems good, though I'm worried that they are going to fall out of my ears due to the crazy angle at which I'm forced to insert them. Taps and gestures produce the intended result, and the ""speak-to-chat"" feature is spot on. Calls work well at both ends, and the volume can be adjusted to your liking.The reason I traded out the Samsung Buds 2 Pros for these was because of two deal-breaking flaws. The Samsungs chewed up my ears like hungry rodents (ouch!), and the lowest possible telephone call volume was punishingly loud. But the audio fidelity? It's rich, detailed, transparent, and smooth. It absolutely blows away the Sonys. Not even a close contest. It is worth noting, however, that I paired the Samsungs with a Galaxy S22, so your milage could vary.To be clear, if high fidelity music listening is not your thing, the WF-1000XM4s may be convenient and useful (if, that is, you can get them to fit your ears properly). But of course if you dont care too much about the fidelity of your music, you can save yourself a few hundred bucks by buying a generic pair of low-cost buds!UPDATE AFTER 2 WEEEKS: The call quality (which was never great) has deteriorated to the point where people on the other end of the call have a lot of trouble hearing me.

After all, the locate function from apple is useless because it requires the product to be active to find it. Which,  if they are in the case and lost, obviously will not be found by the app. Also, the audible sound that it is supposed to emit comes from inside the case (AirPods Pro gen 2), so also useless because it is inaudible. That said, if the locate function does not help me not lose them, why not try something else, right?At first glance when I received them, they seemed nice. The Sony product is quite difficult to get out of the case. Even after several days, I am still fumbling every time to pull them out. The magnet that holds them in is a bit too strong, and just the ergonomics of the case and the way they fit in there makes it really hard to get a good grip with two fingers to pull them out. The rubber ear pieces also do not stay on very well. Several times, when I go to pull it out of my ear, the rubber part stays in my ear canal and almost need tweezers to get them out. I tried downsizing to the next smaller ear piece and they will just not stay in my ear at all and fall out with just simple walking around or moving my head.Next, the noise cancellation is not very good at all, far worse than the apple ear pods.Finally, the app you have to download to check battery life, adjust certain settings, is very finicky. It quite often will not connect to the device.I am going to give it a try for a couple more days just to make sure I am not just being preferential to the product I was used to but quite likely will be returning these.Update: almost a month into using these and only more problems. They are not very good at all with an iPhone. When a call comes in and you answer it, even though you are connected and may be listening to music, often the call goes to the phone. Then as you start talking on the phone, randomly switches back to the pod. This happens back and forth randomly and repeatedly and consistently with every call.  Basically this product is only good for listening to music. Sound is good as long as you don’t need excellent noise cancellation. One last thing, don’t sell me a product that then makes me have to subscribe to another product to get full functionality. Not happening.

The battery drains down to zero within a 30 minute window (faster if your volume is maxed out).After having looked up the issue online is this not a rare issue but a COMMON issue that Sony has apparently not addressed in even their new line of Sony WF-1000XM5s. I had reached out to Sony for assistance they did offer to repair the headphones  or to give a check for the amount I paid. I was told that the repair would also take longer since they are experiencing part shortages. I decided I would take the money and will be going with other brands for my wireless headphones. I will not be purchasing Sony headphones further more.",True,Color: BlackPattern: Headphones,[],10.0,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,1104.0,752.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 164.97, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
5.0,A sound quality focused headset that goes way harder than you'd think it should.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK735S6N8LTI7?ASIN=B0B8TC6KWF,149 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2023",2023-08-10,United States,,"So, I've owned a lot of wireless headsets over the last few years, and so far, in almost every category, this takes the cake. I didn't expect a headset from Samsung to go this hard, especially with my fondness for Audio Technica and Sennheiser setting my expectations, but here we are. Let's break it down:The first thing I want to state is that I've replaced my last 3 headsets due to their death, and so longevity of this headset will heavily determine whether this review stays 5 starts. I've had it for around two months now, and I expect, generally, to get at least a year out of something like this under pretty heavy use. So far the only headset I've had that met this expectation was the Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless, lasting around a year and a half before one of the buds gave out unexpectedly. After that is was the Audio Technica CKS50TW, out of which I got a grand 3 months, and didn't honestly care to replace under warranty.SOUND QUALITY: My standards for sound quality are pretty high. My desktop audio setup is an Audio Technica ATH-M50x, and while that's not the most impressive headset ever on its own, it's fed by an EVGA NuAudio sound card, and produces some impressive sound with a little bit of EQ tweaking. This headset gets so close to that sound quality that I probably use it more than the M50X now when at my desk. It's better than both the CKS50TW and CX Plus by quite some margin in this regard, and I've seriously come to enjoy the 'dynamic' EQ preset. It is *stunning* quality, in my opinion, for a headset of this price. In case you were wondering, yes it's better than the AirPods, although I've found that *most* headsets from reputable manufacturers in this price range are.BATTERY LIFE: This is perhaps the one aspect of this headset that *doesn't* completely take the cake, but it's still absolutely respectable, and I completely agree with sacrificing battery life for comfort and size, because that is another aspect in which this headset shines. Look- the battery life isn't the *best*, but I typically get 5-7 hours out of it, more if you have noise control turned off, and truthfully, in my room, I don't need it most of the time. There are a lot of headsets out there that do better in this category, but the tradeoff they make is protruding out of the ear to house their larger batteries, and in this case, I think the fact that we're able to get this much battery into an earbud that completely nestles into a fully supported and secure position in the ear is worth it. This is still *plenty* of battery life in my opinion, and the headset charges swiftly, as does the case.NOISE CANCELLING: The ANC and hear-through are both best-in-class as far as my experience goes. This was something where Sennheiser just about made it and Audio Technica kinda fell on their face, but this is the best ANC of any headset I've tried. It does a *fantastic* job of silencing typical office/home background noise like vents, fans, etc. as well as outdoor noise like engines, wind, etc.. One of the other benefits of the completely rounded in-ear design with no protrusion is that they are susceptible to comparatively little wind noise while doing things like cycling, which is my main use case for these. I'm willing to bet that their completely nestled fitment helps with noise cancellation, and may explain why other headsets that protrude further tend to fall flat in this category.There's little else for me to talk about beyond the fitment, and that's something I've said enough about. They're very comfortable, they fit very closely and don't protrude out to catch things like the wind, or my hair. They stay in place exceptionally well, and my overgrown pixie cut even hides them completely because of their low profile. My only complaint is that if the tip of a hair pokes into the pickup for the ANC, it can cause some static until you brush off the hair, a relatively minor gripe that only applies to people within a very narrow range of hair lengths, since longer hair couldn't poke its ends into the pickup, and shorter hair wouldn't reach it.Overall, I sincerely hope this headset lives a long life; I've very much enjoyed it so far, and would like to for as long as possible. The build quality seems decent, and my only concern is dropping the buds on a hard surface or wax ingress, but I think both the headset and tips are well-designed to prevent wax ingress, and dropping things is sort of an end user problem in this case that only particularly butterfingered individuals like myself really struggle with, so we'll see how this goes.",True,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2,[],1.0,B0B8TC6KWF,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B8TC6KWF?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B8TC6KWF&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,3631.0,679.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 110, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Galaxy Buds2 Pro
5.0,Reliable Companion for the Long Haul - A Year with the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPBYOEEH7GR13?ASIN=B0B8TC6KWF,31 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2023",2023-10-06,United States,,"I've had the pleasure of using the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2 [2022] in Violet for a year now, and I'm happy to share my thoughts on this second pair. Here's what I've found:Pros:Low-Key Design: I appreciate the understated design of these earbuds. They're sleek and don't draw unnecessary attention while still looking stylish.Amazing Noise Canceling: The noise-canceling capabilities of the Galaxy Buds Pro 2 are truly impressive. They effectively drown out ambient noise, making them perfect for quiet work sessions or immersive music enjoyment.Great Sound Quality: The audio quality is top-notch. The sound is crisp and clear, and I've been consistently impressed by the overall audio performance.Excellent Volume and Bass: These earbuds deliver a punchy bass and satisfying volume levels. They make my music and movies sound fantastic.Easy to Clean: Maintaining these earbuds is a breeze. They are easy to clean and keep looking fresh.Long Battery Life: The battery life has remained impressive throughout the year. I rarely find myself needing to recharge them, even with regular use.Cons:Not Ideal for Sweaty Workouts: One downside I've noticed is that when I get sweaty during intense gym sessions, these earbuds can start slipping out. It's a bit frustrating and interrupts my workout flow.Falls Out of the Case: The earbuds have a tendency to fall out of the case if it's dropped or mishandled. It would be great if the case had a more secure mechanism to keep them in place.Missing External Speaker: I often wish there was an external speaker on the case to help locate them when they are inside. It would be a helpful addition for those moments when you misplace them.Despite these minor drawbacks, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2 [2022] has been a reliable audio companion for me over the past year. The combination of great sound quality, superb noise canceling, and a long-lasting battery makes them well worth considering.

5.0,A great companion for Samsung ecosystem.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U9EN7BD8G16V?ASIN=B0B8TC6KWF,10 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2023",2023-10-02,United States,,"I've had lots of earbuds and headphones but my daily drivers have been the Samsung Buds 2 and the Air Pod 2s. I normally use some Sennheiser's when going over the ear but like the convenience of buds.These are fantastic fit with Samsung ecosystem (phones (S22 Ultra) and tablets (A8)). While they're serviceable compared to over the ear sets it's tough to beat the bigger drivers.At first I was a bit disappointed with the scope of the sound stage compared to my Buds 2 but bare with me. After about 5 hours of listening these warmed up considerably. The other adjustment I made was getting after market ear tips. I'm using the Comply foam ones but only because the AZLA silicone ones wouldn't get to me in time for a trip.The foam tips changed this from a small upgrade over the Buds or Air Pods to a clear winner. The base is significantly improved at lower and mid volumes and the mid tones were also excellent. I wish I could get a bit more definition in the higher ranges but you can hear the secondary tones on high-hats and that's usually a great indication of clarity in these. The higher quality codec for HD music is fantastic and and the 360 audio is really clever. Atmos movies also sound fantastic although I haven't run Atmos with the 360 to see how that is.I'd also say that the ANC is a good step up over the Buds 2 and easily ahead of the Air Pods. Not sure how they would stand up to the Sony WM5s but at a third the price the difference to me was negligible.Played with many different types of content and music from Classical, Jazz to EDM & Classic Rock. The dynamic EQ was fine although you can also put it on a flat EQ on the buds and use the custom EQ inside the Samsung sound settings to punch things up to your liking.TLDR: A great pair of buds with modern Samsung phones and tablets.

I payed $300 and used them for a couple of years - I was very happy with them. They had awesome sound quality, best ANC available, and good battery life. Then, a few months ago, I noticed that when they were wirelessly charging, the light would go from orange (normal) to red and blinking. Each time I would get a warning via the Sony app on my phone that the headphones were too hot - so, I switched to just charging with the cable and that problem went away.I typically only use these headphones for around an hour at a time. I started noticing that the battery would die early - I thought perhaps they weren't fully charging. But no, they were going from 100% to 0 in less than an hour. Then, less than 30 minutes. Then, I couldn't get through a 10 minute YouTube video without the right one dying.After looking into it I discovered that I was not alone - it appears Sony has updated the firmware, somehow causing the batteries to get absolutely wrecked. Once the battery is overcharged or overdischarged, the damage is done. I reached out to Sony and they essentially told me that without a physical receipt, there is nothing they can do - a digital receipt just would not do. Sony is not addressing this issue in a way that I respect at all, and they have lost my loyalty over what was otherwise a fantastic product. So, I figured, Samsung has never let me down, let me try these...These Samsung headphones are better than expected - the sound quality is almost as good as the Sony's, the ANC isn't as good but it's not bad, and they're smaller and less obtrusive.

4.0,"Such great sound, painful design for smaller ears",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H8R7BRAON8JT?ASIN=B0B8TC6KWF,33 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2023",2023-09-15,United States,,"This earbuds are absolutely incredible for the cost differential; pay a bit more, massive upgrade in sound quality.I have nice speakers and decent wired over-ears at home, but with my partner and I both working hybrid schedules, I usually listen to music and podcasts with my earbuds in. I always told myself I'd just use my speakers, but being able to have just one bud in so I'm not walking around the house like an oblivious wad is irresistible. The wireless convenience calls to me. However, I've never been so much of a noise geek that I was going to pay for nicer wireless earbuds. Still, the reality of the situation is that I use earbuds an overwhelming amount of the time.Because of this, it crept up slowly that I've hardly been listening to music. I had the older, non-pro Galaxy buds 2 for years- replaced once with the same model to have spares without an upgrade- and while I loved the look and feel of them and they were serviceable, the sound was not great. Audio for calls was sometimes terrible, and I was unintelligible half the time. They fell out of my ears if I was running, although not so abruptly I couldn't fix the positioning and prevent them from popping out with a free hnad. Ultimately, none of these issues were enough to make me want to upgrade to the bulkier, more expensive Pro earbuds. Still, when my older headphones started to get finicky again, I eventually bit the bullet, thinking I might just get more of the non-Pros anyway.It was amazing. These are the first earbuds I've owned where the sound quality was worth even listening to music on, and that's when I realized immediately how much more I'd be listening to. They have great, rich, dynamic sound. I didn't love the look of the exterior speaker on the larger buds, but I 180'd as soon as I heard the results- obviously, it was worth it.They were so much bigger that they looked a little goofy in my ears. Not a big deal, worth the effect and good noise that came out of them. I've been very excited.Unfortunately, I like having background noise running for much of my workday, and my partner and I often have different listening priorities. This is a problem because I quickly realized that, if worn for an extended period of time, these are physically painful on the cartilage of my ears. No matter how I positioned them, if I wore them for a few hours, my ears (specifically, whatever you call the curve of cartilage above the lobe) get sore to the touch for hours or days. Seemingly, I can get about an hour of listening out of these a day. That's a downer, as I didn't buy them thinking I'd have to restrict my use of them as aggressively as my parents tried to limit my screen time in the early 2000s.On the plus side, they still sound great, and my old headphones ended their time on the fritz, so I've just gone back to them. I can wear these around the house where my options are ample, and in theory, I'll probably still use them. I'm holding out secret hope that I can slowly damage the cartilage of my ears enough that I can wear them longer, but for now, I'm punished with seriously tender ear-tissue that lasts for days and bothers me even if I switch headphones or earbuds.Long and short of it, they sound great. They're massively worth the money if you're considering an upgrade from the regular galaxy 2's for the pro's (although I still prefer the smaller, simpler look aesthetically). They even stopped falling out of my ears when I'm on a run with this new design. Unfortunately, be cautious if your ear-holes aren't on the larger side and you aren't willing to gauge a weird part of your ears as part of the bargain.",True,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2,[],1.0,B0B8TC6KWF,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B8TC6KWF?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B8TC6KWF&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,529.0,117.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 110, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Galaxy Buds2 Pro

The phone sees a serial number (not the name of the product) and fails to pair.The buds will pair with a Galaxy 6 classic watch, but since neither the buds nor the watch come with documentation, it took some sleuthing to find a solution that worked.  As so:The buds go into pairing mode when the case is opened.  Best practices is to leave the case on a charger for an hour or so before first trying to pair.From the watch, go to setup -> connections -> bluetooth.  Turn on bluetooth if not on.Open the case for the earbuds.  This starts the pairing process.When the buds name come up in the watch display, touch it.  You should be paired at that point.Save yourself some trouble and put the Galaxy Buds Pro app in the Tiles screen so you can find it easily.Go to the Galaxy Buds Pro app.Note that you need to have the buds firmly seated in your ears for the noise cancellation to work.  Like, really firmly.You'll notice when the buds are seated firmly enough because the ""noise cancellation"" button will no longer be greyed out and the sound quality improves dramatically.One final note:  These buds are only as good as the source.  If the music source is highly compressed, the buds will sound tinny.  With a good music source and with the buds seated properly they seem decent.There doesn't seem to be any kind of mixer app on the watch, so you can't do things like bring up the bass or fix the treble.  I'd love to be wrong on this but I have not found any way to change the mixture.  A lot of the music on the Amazon Music app sounds tinny as a result.

I was told that I could use it with 'any brick type Samsung charger.'  I was uninformed - didn't know what that was - so after researching I learned that it's just a regular wall plug in like the ones for USB cords, but with a type C port instead.  i could get one for $20 or $25 - or more if so inclined.

Perhaps the other earpiece is a ""stay at home"" earpiece and does all the cooking, cleaning, and theoretically, raising the of baby ear pieces these earbuds buds might have. What this earpiece doesn't do, is work.  Maybe I got the gold-digger version instead of the house-spouse version.

I thought it might be getting power drunk on all that extra charge so I left it off the juice for a month!  No dice though.

Through my own troubleshooting I have been able to unpair and re-pair them, usually several times and they’ll work. Unfortunately the right bud is completely dead now. I’ve had these for just ONE MONTH, and a week, missed the 30 day return window.I have to pay a 47 dollar restocking fee for their faulty product because I decided to not return them within that window, as I thought the issue was resolved. You tell me, is it fair to pay any type of fee to return defective merchandise? I don’t even want my money back, I even called and tried to get a replacement pair, but nope.Hopefully you read this review and understand the concepts and you will avoid making the mistake of mine. They only sound great when both ears work. And this isn’t any negative against Amazon, it’s solely aimed at the company who sold and make them, because Amazon tried to reason with Seinheisser and guess what? They still think it’s ok to take my 47 dollars as a restocking fee. Whatever is German for >insert exploitive words of choice here< I say it back at them with a choice of that rarely used finger, and disgust exudes my pores and from deep within.

Both chirp randomly, cause a very uncomfortable pressure inside my ears, and frequently become too quiet to hear even on max volume.

The first thing I noticed (I got them default in Ambient Mode) was the very loud and noticeable white noise, that the 30$ Tozo T6's don't have.Cons:1) The Ambient Mode has a very loud and distracting ""White Noise"".  The microphones used to pick up ambient sounds are low quality and cheap, with a very high Noise Floor.  You may adjust the Ambient Mode sensitivity in the latest software update, however, if you turn down the white noise, you also effectively lose the Ambient feature.  I tried to find a sweet spot at around 40% sensitivity in Ambient mode, but unfortunately it just doesn't stack up to the natural sounding Ambient Mode of the Apple Airpod 2 Pro.2) The minimum volume is too loud.  Sennheiser decided to increase the loudness of the TMW3's compared to 2nd generation.  I don't know why they did that, because the TM2's were loud enough, even below max volume.  Nobody ever complained about them being too quiet.  But because of this change, many youtube Audio Reviewers, consumers, and myself have noticed that you cannot use these for bed time because the very lowest sound setting (other than actual mute, volume off), is LOUD.  It's not relaxing.  We should have the option of a fine gradient of sound volume for 200$ earbuds.PROS:1) Oh the sound is absolutely as amazing as all the reviewers suggest.  I've never heard such beautiful sounding music.  So clear.  Many songs I listened to hundreds of times in the past came to life and I could hear parts of the music that were previously obscured to me.  I think the Hi-Definition option is a gimmick though.  I did not notice the music sounding too much better with it on, or any difference at all.2) The battery life.  It lasts.  The case, it's small enough (people complain but it's not that big.)  The case charges fast.  The earbuds charge fast in the case.  Both have good battery life.  Love it.3)  The software is pretty easy to use, albeit slow at startup.  It has good useful functions, among them the option to turn of the very loud voice notifications and substitute them for gentle, robotic ""beeps"" to notify you of connection, disconnection, etc.  This is really nice.  But the fact that the earbuds are inherently too loud on their lowest setting kind of makes this a moot point.4)  The fit.  The earwings really help.  They do not hurt or dig in as people say.  You can customize the size, and rotate if it hurts, to adjust the ratio of secureness/comfort.Conclusion:  These are being returned.  I could live with the white noise in ambient mode, but the loudness at the lowest settings is by far the loudest I've ever used.  This makes me mad because Sennheiser actually ""improved"" the 3rd generation by making it louder, and as a result, the lowest volume (it's a linear function from min to max volume) is just too freaking loud.

So you will need to install the ""Smart Control"" App from App Store, in order to get the firmware upgrade.There is also an option in the Bluetooth setting to disable volumne sync (or Disable absolute volume), so that you get a finer control of volume levels.A positive note is the touch control settings.  Unlike other manufactures, Sennheiser have chosen not to allow cycling of ANC and Transparency.  In other typical TWS buds, it is very annoying to have to cycle through ANC to Transparency to Normal mode.  Sometimes you have to guess which mode you're in.  In the M.TWS3, you can only assign a touch option to Transparency, and a different tocuh option to ANC.  And this IMO is a very good arrangment, to avoid confusion of different modes.  Thank you Sennheiser!!(2) Next the Subjective:Like most earbuds, it needs good fitting to produce the expect sound quality and sonic experience.  So ppl who complained about the sound of M.TWS3 probably did not have correct fittings.Aside from that, once you get a correct earbuds fitting, here is how it sounds...Lows --> deep with good impact (a little boomy at the very low end, below 50Hz; can fix by EQ)Mids --> spacious, good imaging, with sweet vocals (vocals are never shouty)Highs --> rounded with a bit of sparkle (no sibilance at all)Here's the EQ setting used (Pop/Rock genre)...Bass: -2.8dbMid: +1.3dbTreble: -1.5dbMomentum True Wireless 3 brings back the traditional ""Sennheiser"" sound!  If you've had experience with HD650 or IE800, then Momentum True Wireless 3 should be in familiar territory.It does not sound silbilance, otherwise would hurt your ears.  And vocals are not shouty when you crank up the volume.(3) Subjective compare:Many people have also praised the 1More Evo TWS earbuds. And it is in similar price point as the M.TWS3. So it's a reasonable comparison. First off the 1MoreEvo does sound pretty good with the dual 10mm DLC dynamic driver + BA configuration. It tries to present the entire frequency spectrum.  However, vocal does sound a bit artificial, and treble can be a bit harsh. Maybe there is a bit of distortion issue with the crossover of the dual drivers setup. On top, the smaller acoustic chamber of the 1MoreEvo could affect its optimal sound.On the other hand, the M.TWS3 single dyanmic TrueResponse driver together with is proprietary DSP is able to produce entire audible frequency range with minimal distortion. Music is more natural and pleasing from the M.TWS3. The TrueResponse driver is simply amazing.While it might be difficult to compare the two if you've only had one or the other. But the winner is clear once you have both the 1MoreEvo and M.TWS3, and listen to them side by side.  M.TWS3 sound is much more refined, yet not pretentious.IMO, the TrueResponse driver has much more potential than in is current state of M.TWS3. I think it is limited only by the quality of the Bluetooth Codec, which means you'd only get compressed audio.  Bluetooth by design is a low power short range radio and therefore bandwidth is always going to be limited natually.(4) Summary:Some people have said that M.TWS3 sounded more like a Hi-Fi speakers than earbuds, and I tend to agree. In a quiet room, you could be lost in the music. That's how wonderful the M.TWS3 sounds, while also being comfortable.  If you don't want to spend hundreds $$ on a pair of IE800S, why not spend only a fraction of the price on a pair of M.TWS3?  While the Momentum TrueResponse driver cannot compare to the XWB drivers in IE800/900, you will still get over 90% of the quality.Sennheiser have made many headphones and earphones in the past, and some of them are a hit, while others are a miss.

4.0,The TW2s are overall better - but I can sleep with these ones in,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9P6FWXVE32ES/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09T8YPFV2,44 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2023",2023-08-06,United States,,"Abstract: The Momentum TW2s are hands-down better than the newer TW3s for general daily use, but the TW3s have one major advantage - they are so much more comfortable that I can fall and stay asleep with them in.The TW3s are in one way better and several ways worse than the TW2s.The bad:1. The case does not always charge the headphones, even when the case has a full charge or is connected to a charger. The metal contacts between the headphones and the case are very sensitive to dirt and grime, and the headphones will not charge if there is even the slightest bit of dirt or misalignment of the contacts. Worse, the headphones don't automatically turn off if they don't detect that they are in the case, and I have frequently went to use them after several hours of ""charging"" only to find one or both earbuds completely drained. This has become less of a problem since I got into the habit of regularly and meticulously cleaning the electrical contacts, but I never had this problem with the TW2s.2. Getting a decent fit requires a lot more fiddling compared to the TW2s. On the one hand, it's nice that they provide more adapters to fit different ear shapes, but the overall shape of the TW3s just doesn't fit my ears as well as the TW2s. Once I do have a good fit, they're more apt to slide out of place whereas the TW2s stay firmly in place, even during intense physical activity. Everyone has different ears, so your mileage may vary.3. It's much easier to accidentally trigger a button press on the capacitive touch sensor when adjusting the earbuds. With the TW2s, the touch sensors were on a flat disc with hard edges, making it easy to grab the earbuds by the non-touch sensitive part. With the TW3s, this hard boundary is replaced with a smooth edge, making it more difficult to adjust the earbuds without unintentionally triggering a button press.The good:1. (This mostly applies to side sleepers) I can fall asleep with these things in. They're not as comfortable as foam earplugs, but they're pretty close. The TW2s are just as comfortable for daily use but when I try to sleep on my side with them in, they press into my ear and become quite uncomfortable after a few minutes. The TW3s don't stick out as much as the TW2s, and they don't feel like they're getting jammed into my head nearly as much. Being able to stick in some noise cancelling earbuds playing gray noise at low volume is a godsend when you have upstairs neighbors who keep a different sleep schedule and stomp around when you're trying to sleep. This alone is enough to make me recommend the TW3s. Just be sure to disable audible feedback through the Smart Control app so you don't get jolted awake with a verbal ""RECHARGE HEADSET"" notification.2. They sound just as good as the TW2s. The TW2s already sound fantastic and I can't imagine anything but the smallest incremental improvement being made to sound quality, insofar as I can detect such a change with my middle-aged ears.",True,Color: Black,[],3.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,352.0,113.0,fourStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3

I also have used them for sleep as well to varying degrees of success.  It's a blessing to be able to pull these out of their container and put these on if I'm needing sound deadened from outside while eating, reading, or even walking through a grocery store or sitting in a waiting room where the medical providers seem to believe that a television blaring home improvement shows is ""soothing"" to the folks sitting there.Sound wise, they kick ass for what they are, if you're an audiophile it's not perfect, nor can they be.  They're Bluetooth, and they're earbuds so don't expect them to sound like  a pair of HD600's or AKG's, or your favorite set of headphones.  Also, if you play garbage, such as low bandwidth streaming, or audio sources, you will know it as they are very unforgiving, and can be a bit disorienting.  I was getting a warbling between the two earbuds and thought it was a problem with the earbuds, but I tried on a set of wired headphones and got the same effect which meant it was the source material and not earbuds.The biggest knocks I have on them are both frustrating, as they could and should be corrected.First the earbuds are rubber and work well enough, however if you are walking or moving briskly, you will get the feeling of them falling out, and in some instances I have had them fall out.  This is easily rectified getting 3rd party ear tips that grip just a little better.  This actually does help with the noise cancelling as well in some instances as well.  If you're going to charge folks the amount of money that these cost.  $20 for replacement eartips off the bat is annoying.Also, and this one can be a deal breaker for some folks.  The charging of these earbuds can be frustrating.  I had to use the trial and error method to finally determine that you can have it charge ONE bud and not both.  So every time I put them in to be recharged i have to put one in.  let it sit there for 30 seconds, if the glowing orange/yellow LED stays pulsing, it means its charging.  Then I have to remove it, and try the other... and perform the same test.  Sometimes all it really takes is wiggling them in the socket to make sure the connection registers.  It's frustrating as you shouldn't have to waste 90 seconds to make sure your earbuds are charging.  I had multiple nights where I put them in and they stated the battery was low even though it looked like they had charged.  Since I've gone with the method above, I have not had this issue.Noise cancelling is very good,  there are certain frequencies that seem to get through no matter what I try.  My spouse uses a humidifier and if it is running at medium or high, I still hear it even with them in with my own white noise to block it out, it isn't severe, but it is there.Honestly, they sound and perform well enough, that even with those pretty big knocks above, I am keeping them as I've found solutions to the issues.  Some folks will potentially go for the Apple and Sony alternatives but I've found that neither of those pass the sound tests for me personally.Pros:- Incredible sound from earbuds.- Great Noise Cancelling- Smaller than their prior version which was just too block-y to be of use for me.Cons:- Need to purchase replacement tips to get full enjoyment, and comfort from them- Charging can be incredibly frustrating and should be rectified by Senheiser sooner than later.",True,Color: Black,[],4.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,352.0,113.0,fourStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3

4.0,Premium audio with a couple of downsides,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R272OUGQMVQHXA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09T8YPFV2,33 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2022",2022-08-25,United States,,"This is my first set of premium ear buds by Sennheiser. I prefer their over ear headphones, but I needed something more suitable and subtle for video meetings that are required for my WFH setting.The pros that come to mind:-Noise cancelation. I currently have a personal server running 24/7 in my office, and it sounds like a small plane engine. These ear buds completely eliminate the shrill whirring. The clicks of a mouse and keyboard keys are still faintly audible from time to time, though.Sound quality - The sound stage on these is fantastic. There is a little sacrifice to the quality of sound with it being an in-ear device (think sounding a little compressed and less spatial in a way),  but the mids are warm and the highs are crispy (sometimes in a way that feels like your skull is getting a nice scratch, so if that's too much you can adjust in their app). The bass is fairly restrained by default, but you can adjust that in the app as well. If you like music that is bass-heavy, these might not be the best fit for you.Controls - the controls are simple, and I love that they can be customized to my  preference in the app. The auto-pause to music when taking out the right ear bud is a huge plus for me!Cons:The ear bud tips - the M3s come with various sized ear buds, but unfortunately (for me anyways) they get pretty uncomfortable after about 4 to 5 hours of wear. I wound up switching to aftermarket bud tips as I found myself fiddling with the buds in my ears a lot to the point where the inside of my ears started to chafe. The other issue is that the ear pieces will slowly come loose or fall out if you are talking or eating with them in. I primarily use the M3s for stationary/desk work, so this isn't the biggest dealbreaker, but I don't feel that they would be ideal for use with working out or any activity where you're moving around (or talking) a lot.Bugs - The M3s were a little bit of a pain to initially get connected to the app, but once they were set up I have had no issues there. The app immediately prompted firmware updates once connected. The only problem I seem to have is that if I take a phone call and hang up my left ear bud will stop working, or the noise cancelation will stop doing its thing temporarily. I have to return both of them to their case and reconnect them to my Bluetooth for both the left ear bud and noise cancelation to work again. Hopefully this is fixed in a future update.Overall, I've been very happy with the M3s, and they get pretty heavy use from me. I've been consistently wowed by the quality of sound these bad boys put out! Perhaps one day Sennheiser will come out with some comfort ear tips, but in the meantime I continue to be pleased with my purchase.",True,Color: Black,[],6.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,352.0,113.0,fourStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3

I'd rather see a loading screen to know it's still working than for it to pretend it's ready even though it actually still needs a few seconds more.The noise cancellation is EITHER fantastic at wind or fantastic at everything else, but never both (you pick one or the other in the app)And the one single feature I've seen on other earbuds that I really really miss is the ability to activate audio pass through aka active listening with only one earbud in.That would allow me to answer calls while still being able to hear the world around me (active listening and noise cancellation turn off during phone calls, presumably so it can focus on noise cancellation for your voice), but otherwise act as if the earbud is not there. Really a nice feature to have and I miss it dearly.And I found the feature on a cheap pair of earbuds too! C'mon Sennheiser.Note: all of these could theoretically be fixed via app updates if Sennheiser is watching these reviews. I'll update my review if they fix even one of the three issues I mentioned (and change it to 5 stars)Now the good:Audio quality is fantastic: good solid bass without sounding muddy, clear and crisp treble without being grating.Mic quality is amazing: callers can understand me in my work van on the highway with the AC blowing without even raising my voiceNoise cancellation is great: I can be on the highway with the windows down and the ""anti wind"" mode can take it just fine, and the ""standard"" mode does an excellent job of dampening everything else... So long as it isn't windy.Battery life is impressive: it lasts through a full eight hour shift running either noise cancellation or active listening non stop and being used for audiobooks and phone calls intermittently.Comfort is also impressive: as you might have guessed from that previous entry, I wear these all day through my entire shift and my ears don't hurt at all by the end, nor do they do slip out once they are inserted correctly, which does admittedly take some finagling sometimes. HOWEVER I strongly recommend getting foam inserts instead of using the provided silicone ones. Not only are they more comfortable, but they dampen sound better too.Fun fact! I wore these to an outdoor gun range and with the foam inserts the noise cancelling was sufficient to protect my ears from the sound of gunfire.

I had my UE fits (5 different pairs) for a year, then gave the Bose QCII's vs. Sennheiser Momentum 3's a back to back 30 day test.Both are very good, but also VERY different sound.  I liked the comfort of bose better, and if your jam is base, the Sennheiser is not for you!  I actually struggled with the Sennheiser sound and almost returned them...even after contacting support (which did not return first email).  On the flip side, the BOSE have too much base...I ended up comparing the too with the low end all the way down on BOSE, and all the way up on Sennheiser.  What I found is going up a size on the Sennheiser ear cone significantly improved low end sound and made them the better sound choice for me.On Sound...the BOSE provide a more full experience, with much more base, and what I call warmer overall sound, but vocals and instrumentals are lacking...which is where the Sennheiser really shined for me.  Both are good in different ways, I just found I preferred the crisp, clean sound  of the Sennheiser.Another area the Sennheiser excelled is the app.  More customizable, and more features than the bose.  I also much preferred the touch features on the Sennheiser.  Very simple, no swiping, and customizable.The biggest thing I like is the touch pause in transparency mode...with one touch of the earbud, music can pause while going into transparency mode...great when someone walks up to your desk to talk!With limited time to use, I'd say the transparency and noise cancellation are a bit better on the BOSE.  Not that the Sennheiser was bad, but better.The biggest thing I will miss in the BOSE is the comfort.  They feel more lightweight and didn't hurt my ear canals as much.

I did and I have some mixed feelings after the first few days of using the MTW3.  My first observation is that it's an incremental upgrade.  The 3 is better than the 2 in most respects but the improvement is not earth shaking.  It's incremental.  The sound is a little different, if not better, and the ANC is improved if you can get a proper seal with one of the provided eartips.  The new shape may or may not improve your comfort level.  Personally, I find the sound to be brighter but at the same time the bass is improved too.  The overall response is good, and I don't apply any EQ.  The sound is very clean and crisp much like the Sony XM4 but fuller with a little better bottom end.The fit is another matter.  For me, the MTW3 is okay but not as comfortable as the MTW2, but by only a small margin.  However, to achieve that comfort level with the MTW2, I use Spinfit CP360 eartips.  The factory eartips are okay but I get a better seal with the Spinfit eartips and they are more comfortable.  The MTW3 has a larger nozzle so the CP360 tips do not fit.  The CP145 tips fit the larger nozzle but the eartip specs differ from the CP360 so it doesn't feel as comfortable in my ears.  That said, the CP145 is still more comfortable than the factory tips and I can get a better seal which improves the sound quality of the MTW3.I've been using the MTW3 for a couple of weeks now.  Initially, I would have said that if you already have the MTW2 it's not worth $250 to upgrade to the 3.  My feeling now is that I'm glad I upgraded.  I'm not sure if it's because of a burn-in period but the MTW3 sounds better today than it did when I first got it.  The apt-X codec is a must for the best sound.Update:  The Spinfit CP1025 eartips will fit the MTW3.  I find them to be the best fit and most comfortable in my ears.  Sound isolation is very good and that improves the sound quality and ANC.Update 2:  After 5 months of use, the right earbud went bad.  Now, I can't use ""transparency mode"" if ANC is on.  If I do, the right earbud produces a low-pitched rumble loud enough to obscure the music.  It was easy to go online and get return authorization but I'm responsible for shipping cost to Sennheiser.  They cover return shipping cost.  I'll provide an update when I get the earbuds back from Sennheiser.Update 3:  Sennheiser replaced the defective pair that I returned to them with a brand new, sealed box.  Total down time from the date I shipped it to them to the date I received the replacement pair was 13 days.  I'm very pleased with the Sennheiser support service and I really couldn't ask for more.

First I am a session musician and love and trust Sennheiser and use their HD-650 cans in my studio.  Being very critical of audio and desiring a flat response and as a mix engineer I am not looking for any abnormalities in the frequency curve. Just smooth mids and flat, normal low and high end. These buds provide that curve for me yet the bass has plenty of kick and more importantly, clarity.The only thing I have noticed is, when I am outdoors, I have experienced an occasional transmission issue between my Android phone (Music Player Hitch Hike app) and the buds. I suppose this could be caused by something external and not directly related to the buds, but ??Again I am still getting used to these but the L & R bud buttons which control various features are pretty sensitive and so far, I feel a little shaky navigating, even just pausing playback or advancing to the next track. Again this may be me but the apparent sensitivity of these buttons is a bit concerning.Fidelity wise, these things kick ass but since they are the only pair of buds I've owned, cannot A|B against Bose and other high end offerings. I will say that given the sound quality these are throwing out, I have no desire to look at others. It's all there.So I think they are OK, I just need more time with them, but I will continue to monitor and examine the technical issues I have described here.Review Update: So, I returned the original product thinking it may be the buds that were defective with not allowing me to pause playback. Then (since I love the fidelity) I reordered another set identical to the ones I returned, this after speaking with Sennheiser tech support.  They were very knowledgeable and wanted to get this right and suggested I return and reorder. Quality people there. They were not defensive at all.Still, with the 2nd set. the pause/resume playback/next song/previous song issue persisted causing me to now suspect the application program I was using in my Samsung/Android phone. All through this,  the volume +/- commands worked.So I installed yet another app from the play store and it solved the problem,  however the new app had ads that were relentless so I removed it and began the search for an alternative.I found Musicolet, a great music player app, installed it and everything is working perfectly. So, it was never the Sennheiser buds, but instead this one Music Player app that would intermittently fail to respond or recognize the Bluetooth commands being sent by the buds.I'm not surprised at all this as I have used and trusted Sennheiser products during my entire career in music. Just glad I finally resolved this problem.I know these are a bit pricey but if you are very discerning about sound quality write the check.

I originally thought I would try them, return them and then try the others, but these are so good for my needs, I am just keeping them.The good (which is almost everything):First and foremost, the sound is amazing. Its clear/airy has a very wide dynamic range and when properly sealed has plenty of bass and clear highs. The in app eq works well do dial in the sound to suit you. I saw some reviews about these not playing quiet enough, but I've not had that issue, the volume will get as quiet as you want them to. On the loud side, they can get WAY LOUD (thankfully). so many of these newer buds artificially limit the volume (probably to avoid being sued) its super annoying. These don't do that and will get as loud as you could ever need.I've only received a couple of calls on them so far, but call quality seems good to me and my wife could hear me just fine.Noise cancellation is very solid. I'm a woodworker and am in the shop most of the day everyday and these are dramatically better than any other buds I've used and even most of the over ear versions like the 3m work tunes and isotunes (plus way more comfortable). I use a lot of loud equipment like the planer, table saw, miter saw etc along with a shop vac, dust collector and large air compressor and these mute them all to low enough levels that I find myself now turning the music volume down a lot from previous buds. Best of all with these kinds of noises, you cannot tell the noise cancellation turns on, its just there. Turn transparency mode on and off and you'll quickly realize just how much its doing. The only time I hear the anc activate is when I'm using the air nailer. that pop, pop, sound gets muted, but you can hear the anc kick in when its doing it. Otherwise you don't even know its working, things are just quiet.If your view of noise cancellation is to be in the Cone of Silence, these might not be for you. I can still hear my machines running (barely) but they are perfect for the balance for me between hearing things are running for safety and quiet enough not to be distracting, even with multiple different machines running at the same time.transparency mode is solid, and quick with 1 tap on the left bud. It can pause music or leave it playing depending on how you set it up which is a nice feature. My last buds didn't have that, and I'm really enjoying that feature.Comfort is great. I had to switch to the large silicone ear piece and sealing ring, but aside from that they fit well and stay in place while working. I cant speak to how they would work when exercising or running, but even with me bending, stooping, walking around etc, they have never come loose. They're so light you forget about them.Lastly, the app is great with easy to use settings, pairing is quick and reliable and once you learn how to tap the buds to play/pause/turn on transparency mode etc, controls are easy to use and responsiveThe bad, mainly in the mildy irritating category:firmware update takes Forever. I'm not sure why it takes 20+ minutes to update the firmware on these little guys, but it does. Seems like they could do better.The ""Bass Boost"" is actually a more of a treble mute. while it does boost the bass a little, what it mostly does is mute the highs to make the bass more noticeable. turn the bass boost on/off a few times while music is playing and you'll quickly hear what I mean. You can eq the treble back in, but someone like Sennheiser should have a better solution than that with their software.The bluetooth range is not great with my Samsung S21 Ultra. With my old Jaybird Tarah pro's which are several years old, I could leave my phone in the garage and walk to the back yard and stay connected. with these I barely get to the end of driveway b4 they start cutting out (maybe 30ish feet or so).

5.0,Replaced my Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R158OGHAQAS8N2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09T8YPFV2,295 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2022",2022-05-21,United States,,"Initial Review: May 21, 2022:Before I start, I like to begin mentioning that I believe that any good quality earbuds/earphones should reveal the sound(s) for what is was originally and naturally intended, thus it should not reproduce the sound artificially and/or overwhelm the integrity of the original intended sound.Everyone will have their different opinions and feedbacks; everyone all has different standards and expectations, so something to consider when reviewing my review.Whenever I write my reviews, I make sure that I'm mindful with the length of my reviews as I understand that some of us don't like reading long reviews. So, I try to be as straight forward as possible, while still trying to also be detailed.My reviews are more based on usage, so if you're wanting a review with technical specs/data (i.e., exact dimensions of earbuds, driver size, frequency range, total harmonic distortion, etc) and other technicalities, then my review might not be good for you. However, if you want to know if the Sennheiser Momentum 3 (m3s) true wireless earbuds (TWE) might be good or bad for you, then here it is.If you are simply wanting to know how the m3s compare to the Sennheiser Momentum 2 (m2s), then fast forward towards the end of the review.I've categorized my verdicts into 7 categories: (1) sound quality; (2) battery life; (3) carrying/charging case; (4) quality of mic/call quality; (5) Fitment/Use Type and Controls; (6) connectivity; (7) noise cancelationVerdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of sound quality:Sound Quality (why it might be good for you):If you want clear, accurate, smooth, and rich sound, then the m3s are for you; if you mainly listen to music such as jazz, classical, pop, rock, instrumental, podcast, and vocal-intensive tracks that are instrumentally and vocally heavy, then the m3s are for you. The m3s thrive in this kind of musical/sound spectrum.Sound Quality (why it might be bad for you):If you’re into bass and/or mainly listen to bass heavy music, then the m3s are not for you (why – because although the bass is adequate for my taste and the bass is neutral and not overproduced, the bass might not be what you’d like it to be if you like some good bass. If you want superior bass, maybe the Sony WF-1000XM4 and/or Bose QuietComfort might be good for you). The m3s mainly provide clean and organic bass, so if you want more bass, try the Sony or Bose.Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of battery life:Battery Life (why it might be good for you):With an appropriate sound level, I got approximately 4.5 hours on a single charge. It’s also important to note that it takes about 10 minutes to provide 1 hour of batter life; which is impressive. If you don’t constantly use earbuds on a daily basis and don’t mind charging the carrying case 1-2 times/week, then the m3s might be good for you.Battery Life (why it might be bad for you):If you use earbuds on a daily basis and often have them on mid to high volume levels, the m3s might be bad for you. If you’re looking for a TWEs with great battery life, consider other options; here are a few options that have significantly better battery life than the m3s: Edifer TWS1 Pro (10hrs); Master & Dynamic MW08 (9hrs);  Jabra Elite 7 Pro (8hrs); Sony WF-1000XM4 (7.5hrs); Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (6hrs)Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of carrying/charging case:Carrying/charging case (why it might be good for you):If you don’t mind a Keurig-sized carrying/charging case, then the m3s might be good for you. Also, the case is able to charge the m3s approximately 3 times from empty to full, and with a 10 minute charge in the case, it provides the m3s with 1 hour of battery life. I'm a bit annoyed with the size of the case; however, it isn't a deal breaker for me; it's more of an eye sore whenever I look at my bulging pocket.Carrying/charging case (why it might be bad for you):If you don’t want a case bulging from your pocket, then the m3s are not for you (why – because I believe the case is a bit tall (height) and no angle is going to prevent it from bulging from your pocket). There are several TWEs out there that have a smaller carrying/charging case; to mention a few: Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (it’s shape like a pebble, so it’s short in height); Jabra Elite 7 Pro (much smaller in terms of width and height). In terms of size, the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros are my favorite; however, in terms of function, it's probably the worst given the angle it takes needed to put/remove the earbuds from the case.Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of quality of mic/call quality:Quality of Mic/Making phone calls (why it might be good for you):One thing that many people disregard with TWE is mic quality/call quality. One of the big things I look for when it comes to TWEs is mic quality/call quality (in which how well the other caller can hear me). I drive a lot, so it annoys me when I’m calling my bank or contacting customer service, and the representative can't hear me loud enough and/or clearly as they hear background noise from driving.If you like being able to be heard clearly and loudly from other callers, the m3s might be good for you. The m3s offers great mic quality, it is able to moderately suppress background noise. Overall, I haven't received too many complaints from other callers. When compared to the Jabra Elite 7 Pros; Sony WF-1000XM4; other several TWEs I’ve used in the past, the m3s beats them in this category by a mile. Even the m2s was mediocre on making phone calls, so the m3s are much improved for making phone calls.Quality of Mic/Making phone calls (why it might be bad for you):If you want to be heard even better (more clearly, loudly, and suppress background noise), I found that the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros is able to do just that. So, if making phone calls is very important for you, the m3s might not be good for you). Similar to my situation with the m2s, the sound quality was there, but the phone quality wasn't there, so I ended up getting and sticking to the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (as it both had the sound quality and mic/call quality that I wanted).Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of fitment/use type/controls:Fitment/Use Type and Controls (why it might be good for you):If you’ll be mainly using the m3s casually, commuting to work, wanting a comfortable fit, then the m3s might be good for you. Fitment wise, the m3s fit great. There are several ear tips to choose from, but the default one was sufficient for me. I would feel confident running in them, but I know the m3s aren’t really intended for that use, so I’d rather use a different TWE for running. Length of wear time is good; I feel that I can have them on for hours without having ear fatigue.In terms of controls, I found the touch control to be responsive and accurate. As of now, I haven’t had any accidental presses and I always knew what I was pressing since I’m able to customize the touch controls via Sennheiser Smart Control App. The one thing I wish the m3 had regarding touch controls is getting some voice confirmation on what I had activated/deactivated; for example, the Jabra Elite 7 Pros would give me a confirmation on what I had activated/deactivated every time I had touched the button. Aside from the m3s lacking the voice confirmation, the m3s touch control is sufficient for my use.Fitment/Use Type and Controls (why it might be bad for you):If you’ll be mainly using the m3s to run/jog/work out, then the m3s are not for you (why – because the m3s are rated IPX4 (water resistant) and although fitment is secure for daily use, fitment is not highly secure for exercising purposes). Since the m3s are rated IPX4, it’s not going to be exactly the best TWE to work out with, especially if you sweat heavily. Also, if absolute fitment is key to you, I suggest probably the most secure TWE with customizable fitment is the Ultimate Ears (UE) Fits; these literally can precisely mold into your ears. Other options to consider might be the Jaybird Vista 2, Beats Powerbeats Pro, Bose Sport Open, and the Anker Soundcore Life Dot 2; all these are better than the m3s in terms of fitment/use type.Regarding controls, everyone is going to have their preference (touch controls or physical controls?). For me, I prefer physical controls as I like the affirmation and tactile feeling of knowing that I had pressed a button. With touch controls, sometimes you can’t even tell if you had press something intentionally and/or unintentionally; therefore, I prefer physical controls. So, if physical controls are important for you, then the m3s might not be good for you. Consider the Jabra Elite line (e.g., 75t, 85t, 7 pro, etc) if physical controls are important. If you don’t mind the touch control, then the m3s might be good for you. The m3s have much of a better touch control than some of the TWEs out there; to name a few, m2s (not always consistent and wasn’t always accurate), Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (one of the worst touch controls as they are very sensitive); Sony WF-1000XM4 (touch control was decent and better than the Liberty 3 Pros and m2s, but not better than the m3s). Although physical buttons is my preference, for me, it’s not one of those deal breaker features.Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of connectivity:Connectivity (why it might be good for you):The m3s have Bluetooth 5.2, aptX Adaptive, aptX, AAC, and SBC. These are all great connectivity features, only if you have devices that support these; if not, then it won't matter; although having it is better than not having it. Since the m3s support 5.2, this means Bluetooth range is great and pairs much faster to devices than TWEs that are on 5.0 or 5.1 Bluetooth. For these reasons, the m3 might be good for you.Connectivity (why it might be bad for you):The m3s might not be a good for you if multi-point is an important feature for you, which if you don't know, multi-point allows the connection of two devices. So, this might be a deal breaker for some people; however, multi-point can be added in the future with a firmware/software update.Verdict for why the m3s might be good/bad for you in terms of noise cancelation:Noise cancelation and Transparency mode (why it might be good for you):If you’ll be using the m3s while commuting and while at the office, then the m3s might be good for you. The noise cancelling on the m3s are great (8 out of 10). Even without having adaptive noise cancelation on (passive isolation), the passive isolation is impressive and sometimes is sufficient where I just disable the adaptive noise cancelation to save battery. So, when you don't have active noise cancelling turned on, it still feels like it's on because passive isolation really blocks out background noise well. The m3s also don’t have that cabin pressure effect that the Sony WF-1000XMF have.  Since I commute a lot, I can say that I can comfortable have the windows mid-way half down and still be able to listen to music without any interruptions from the wind noise; one of the great features of the m3s is being able to customize your settings through the Smart Control App; there's a feature in which is primary intended to block wind noise.Regarding transparency, if you want detailed and close to natural sound as if you aren’t wearing earbuds, then the m3s might be good for you.Noise cancelation and Transparency mode (why it might be bad for you):If you’ll be using the m3s in very noisy environments (e.g., stadium/arena full of people, busy malls, busy call centers, outside construction, and/or anything with that nature), then the m3s might not be good for you (why – because although the m3s have great passive noise isolation and great active noise cancelation, however, it is not superior in the noise cancelation category. If you want superior noise cancelation, maybe the Sony WF-1000XM4 and/or Bose QuietComfort might be good for you; the Sony’s or Bose will be more sufficient to block out most if not all background noise of a stadium/arena full of people.Regarding transparency mode, to put it simply, if you have transparency mode turned on with the m3s, the outside will sound very detailed; so if you don’t like that, then the m3s might not be good for you.Overall comparison between the m2s and m3s:-Loudness drastically improved from the m2s; even at max level volume, the m2s didn’t seem that loud; however, with the m3s, it gets very loud and have yet to reach max level volume (wouldn’t want to do that anyway).-Nose cancelling have drastically improved from the m2s. The nose cancelling from the m2s is a bit of a joke as it feels that it only reduces background noise by approx. 5-10%. However, with the m3s, background noise reduced approx 80%; this is a big jump from the m2s.-Mic/call quality significantly improved from the m2s. I really wanted to keep the m2s at the time because of the sound quality, but settled for the Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 because the mic quality on that thing is one of the best in the industry. So, now that I’ve been using the m3s and have noticed a significant improvement form the m2s, I’ll be selling my Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 and keep the m3s.-Touch controls have significantly improved from the m2s and are less sensitive, yet naturally responsive. The m2’s touch controls were a bit finicky and didn’t seem well-developed; however, the m3’s touch controls are accurate, responsive, and well-developed.-Sound quality considerably improved from the m2s. Although the m2s sound quality were already great to begin with, the m3s appears more articulate and detailed, thus sound quality is excellent as opposed to the m2s.-The design has considerably improved; the m3s appears sleeker and no longer have the shiny aluminum finish (my personal preference) from the m2s. The m3s are also smaller and weighs less than the m2s.-The m3s are cheaper than the m2s when they were first introduced (however, the m2s are now cheaper due to the availability of the m3s).One of the reasons why I returned the m2s were because the call quality and/or mic quality was mediocre; this is why I ended up getting the Soundcore Liberty Pro 3s because the mic quality in addition to the sound quality was excellent.My overall take:I've tried many true wireless earbuds, endlessly searching for the right ones. To name a few: Sennheiser Momentum 2 (currently $199), Jabra Elite 7 Pro (currently $199); Jabra Elite 85t (currently $229); Jabra Elite 75t (currently $215); Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro (currently $129); Master & Dynamic MW08 (currently $299); Bose QuietComfort (currently $279); Sony WF-1000XM4; Apple AirPods Pro; Klipsche T5 II McLaren Edition; Bowers & Wilkins PI7 (currently $400); Grado GT220 (currently $259); Bang & Olufsen Beoplay EQ (currently $399).Based on my numerous attempts from trying my numerous TWEs, I hope you can tell that I like quality sound and although I won’t consider myself an audiophile, I can differentiate between quality sound and poor sound. Originally, I ended up with the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros. The sound quality is amazing, almost just as good as the m2 and m3s; however, where the Liberty Pros lacked was with its weak noise cancelling, awkwardly having to put and take out the earbuds from its case; fitment wasn't always great; touch controls were overly sensitive. After a few weeks and usage of the m3s, I can say that the m3s are one of the best TWEs that I've tried. I've been wanting to replace the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros for awhile now due to the annoyances that I've mentioned earlier, and the m3s have taken my spot in terms of best overall TWEs (for my use and preferences).I plan on trying the Technics EAH-AZ60-K ($229) to see if it can beat the m3s. I'll update my review once I receive it. If not, I plan on keeping the m3s for awhile. For now, I'm happy with the m3s. I plan of updating my review to 5 stars if the m3s is still able to beat the Technics. Likewise, if I have start having problems with the m3s, I’ll adjust my review accordingly.Updated Review: June 02, 2022:Here’s an update (and why I’ve decided to keep the M3s):As mentioned earlier from my initial review, I would only give the M3s 5 stars if it held up to the Technics AZ60s.So here’s the update:*Call quality is very important to me; that’s why I previously had the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros (L3P) as I believe it’s the best true wireless earbuds (TWE) for both audio quality and phone/mic quality. However, I ended up getting rid of the L3P due to several reasons (e.g., ANC was mediocre, connectivity issues, odd fitment, touch control sensitivity issues, and a finicky case). For these reasons, I decided to give up the L3P and try out the M3s. So, after trying out the M3s, I decided to try and compare it to the Technics AZ60. So here’s my take between the M3s and the AZ60:*Both have very good mic quality, but I thought the Technics AZ60 had better a better mic quality; however, it only shines in environments with minimal background noise. In contrast, the M3s seem to do a better job overall in call quality/mic use in both noisy environments as background noise is less noticeable than with the AZ60s. As soon as there is heavy background noise, the AZ60s voice clarity and quality start to deteriorate.*The max volume level on the M3s is one of the loudest (I have yet to have it on max volume as I wouldn’t want to) from the other TWEs I've tried in the past. In contrast, the AZ60s don't get to a level high enough where it would hurt my ears if volume maxed out (a similar issue with the L3P).Verdict:I've decided to bump up my review to 5 stars as I believe the M3s were able to hold off the AZ60s. Although, here's why I WOULD have kept the AZ60s:*The AZ60s case is almost less than half the size of the m3s. This is not too much of a big deal for me, but it just annoys me to see the M3s case bulge out in my pocket. Although the case quality is much better on the M3s, I don’t mind the case quality of the AZ60s as it is fairly a straight forward case, that’s small and light weight, which I prefer.*The sound quality on the AZ60s is slightly better the the M3s  in terms of clarity and richness; although bass is a bit more prominent on the AZ60s than the M3s.*The AZ60’s provide voice feedback/confirmation whenever pressing/tapping the touch control (e.g., “noise cancelling on,” “transparency on,” etc.); whereas the M3s offer no kind of confirmation after tapping/pressing the earbuds.*Noise cancelling on the AZ60s are somewhat identical to the M3s; however, I believe the AZ60s is slightly better, with about a 2% edge over the M3s.Here's why I DECIDED to keep the M3s:*Phone/Mic quality is probably the most important factor for me when it comes to TWEs; secondly, it would be the sound quality. I could not fathom why there are a lot of reviews out there praising the call quality from the AZ60s. Yes, the call quality is great, but ONLY in quiet environments. Overall, it does a terrible job, as I mentioned earlier, on being able to suppress the background noise from my end to the other caller. I've done multiple tests to test the call/mic quality by leaving myself voicemails in different environments (e.g., driving with the window up/down; walking in a busy street; being near a large crowd, etc), and I found that it doesn't make any sense to have a high quality mic, when voice gets distorted from the background noise. I only found the call quality from the AZ60s to be great in quiet environments. However, the M3s did a great job on suppressing background noise from my end to the other caller.Due to the reason above and reasons mentioned prior to this update, I’ve decided to keep the M3s and return the AZ60s.Hope this helps.",True,Color: Black,[],5.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1568.0,405.0,fiveStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3
5.0,Better than AirPods in every way (in terms of sound) - silky smooth!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6W6RF3AK0I48/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09T8YPFV2,59 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2022",2022-06-25,United States,,"I own 8 different pairs of headphones, including many hi-fi pairs like the Sennheiser IE900, Denon AH--D9200 and Fostex TH900.  These TW3s I use more for casual listening, working out, doing stuff around the house, gaming, etc.These are by far my favorite pair of bluetooth buds in this price range - FAR and away better than the AirPods Pro (which I also own).  This should not be surprising, as Sennheiser has been in the sound game for quite a while, and they use similar drivers across their consumer and pro lines, though of course with different tuning and housing components. The result is still something better than most other alternatives.  Brief breakdown.Tonal performance:  These perform extremely well at all volumes.  Oftentimes, you will find that certain parts of the mix are out of balance when the headphones are too high or too low - not the case here.  Whether you want to have quiet background music or crank it up and have a personal dance party, these hold their own well.  They also do not distort at volume.  In terms of tuning, straight out of the box, these are definitely V-shaped - meaning, the bass is boosted, the treble is boosted, and the mids sit back in the mix.  This is often described as a ""fun"" tune, and it is well done here.  It works well for mainstream music.  If you want to tweak this, the fact that you can use the app to do some basic EQing is nice, and they do respond pretty well to EQ.Bass is very well-done.  It has a lot of volume and depth, though out of the box, it is very smooth and controlled and not overly boomy.  However, if you like the boom, there is a bass boost option in the app that certainly delivers.  I'm a basshead myself, and I found the bass boost too much even for me.  If you love bass, these can deliver for sure.Mids here are also silky smooth.  I have always found Sennheiser's vocal presentation to be among the best, and that holds with these.  These also do a good job of keeping all of the pieces of the mix separate.  It's not hi-fi level, but is among the best for this class of product.Highs are also great.  These have the best detail retrieval of any earphone I've used in this price range, though the tuning isn't the only reason for that (will get to it in a second).  The highs also make themselves known without crushing your ears.  I haven't found fatigue to be an issue.Where these really shine is the soundstage and positioning.  While the soundstage itself isn't particularly large, it's VERY good size for this price range (way bigger than the AirPods), and the positioning of the pieces of the mix within that soundstage is outstanding.  The sound here will definitely have an ""in your head"" type feel, with the sound extending from ear to ear.  It does not have a ton of height or depth, but it does have some - but more importantly, the positioning within that soundstage is very, very good.  Often with buds, things will be kind of jumbled - left, right, center.  Not so with these.  The stage is used very well and is very full and natural.All of these things combine to make an overall sound that is warm and smooth.  It is distinctly Sennheiser.  As mentioned earlier, I own their flagship in-ear monitor, the IE900, and while these are certainly not that (and shouldn't be since the IE 900s are 6X the price), they do retain that unique Sennheiser timbre, warmth and soundstage, to an extent, and that's a very good thing.Now onto the other aspects.  Important to note here, I am an Apple ecosystem person - iPhone, iPad, Mac, ATVs, etc.  I now only use my AirPods Pro for podcast listening OR when it is really important for me to have the convenience of AirPods like hands-free hey Siri and message dictation.  Some reasons why...Comfort - for me, far better than the AirPods.  Sennheiser includes way more tips, both with and without wings.  My AirPods constantly have to be readjusted, to the point that I can't actually work out in them.  I wouldn't call this Apple's fault, as everyone's ears are different, but the fact that Sennheiser includes more types of tips means you are more likely to find a fit that is great for you.  This was the case for me, as the ability to add wings really helped them stay in my ear, and now these are my primary workout headphones (and they are water resistant as well).Touch controls - very good.  The fact that they are customizable is great.  The touch is very responsive, and although you may sometimes accidentally tap them when putting them on, it's not a big issue.Battery life is as advertised.  More than good enough.Supported codecs are also great.  For example, these support aptX Adaptive, which for the first time has allowed me to use bluetooth earbuds with my Nintendo Switch with no lag.Noise cancelation is MUCH improved since version 2.  I would say the ANC is on par with the AirPods.  The transparency is ALMOST as good.  I wear them often in transparency mode with no music playing, and it's not a problem.  Everything sounds 9/10.  Where the AirPods beat them is sounding a little more natural with its transparency implementation.  It's clear that the Sennheiser's are processing the sound.The app is easy to use and intuitive, but where I will knock Sennheiser slightly is on bugs.  I did have a few bugs in the first couple of weeks of owning these - connecting to the app, disconnects occasionally and things like that.  They have since worked this out via updates, but it was annoying at first.  Also, you can only connect to one device at a time, which can be a minor inconvenience.  Rumor has it they are adding multipoint functionality in a software update soon.Overall, love these and recommend!",True,Color: Black,[],6.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1568.0,405.0,fiveStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3
5.0,Sennheiser TMW3 wireless earbuds - Best sound quality for wireless earbuds,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R877A2W44VRJL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09T8YPFV2,23 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2022",2022-06-30,United States,,"Sennheiser TMW3 wireless earbuds - Best sound quality for wireless earbudsIf you’re looking for the best sound quality in wireless earbuds, then look no further. I'm currently an iPhone user and so options are a bit more limited for listening to wireless earbuds compared to on Android phones. We don't have the option to listen to the various higher rate codec's that most of these high end earbuds offer, such as aptX Adaptive. We also don't have the options of EQ apps that Android has, so its very important that the earbuds do have an Apple app released for them (which these do and its one of the best). I purchased these Sennheiser TMW3 earbuds for full price $250 in 7/2022 and over a dozen other pairs at various prices ranging up to $400 (including Sony XM4, Linkbuds S, MW08 Sport, Technics AZ60, Bose QC, Airpods Pro) and these sound better than all of them, they're pretty amazing to listen to and have me playing all types of music just to hear it through these earbuds. That's how you know its a good listening experience.Sound Quality: Like I said the sound quality on these is top notch for wireless earbuds. They beat out $350-400 pairs and everything else. The sound is very clear in a way that nothing else matches, the vocals are exceptionally clear compared to other wireless earbuds and the instruments are separated in a way that you can hear everything individually. These also reach the loud volumes that I enjoy being able to crank it up to, which the Sony pairs were seriously lacking as their max volume was still pretty dang quiet and is a major reason I did not keep them. These are truly a joy to listen to and I will be keeping these as my primary pair of earbuds.Comfort: The design of these is comfortable for me personally, the shape is a little different from most other pairs that I've tried but they fit in my ears well and stay there. No discomfort even after wearing them for long periods of time, they're fairly light and I can pretty much forget that they're there.Charging Case: The charging case on these is a bit thicker than something like the Airpods Pro and though it will fit in your pocket it wouldn't be my first choice as a pocket carry for everyday usage if that's your primary function. For a small case to carry in your pocket I'd go with the Airpods Pro for Apple users or the Technics AZ-60 in this same price range, if pocket-ability is more important than the best sound quality. Or go for these Sennheiser and get something like the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1+ for a cheap but quality secondary pair to carry in your pocket, which is what I did personally. The Sennheiser TMW3 carrying case is very nice quality though, with a fabric coating that no others have. It feels very sturdy and well made.Battery Life: The battery life on these is pretty great rated at up to 7 hours playtime for the earbuds and the case holding 21 hours for up to 28 total. I will say that these products usually give a timespan that's a little above reality, I haven't clocked my personal usage but I'd just expect maybe 6 hours or 5 with Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) feature on and depending on volume.Active Noise Cancelling (ANC): The ANC is one of the better ones out at the moment, it works well and is only eclipsed by the Bose QC earbuds or Sony XM4. If ANC is your primary concern, then I recommend the Bose QC especially for iPhone users I do not recommend the XM4 as you're not able to access loud enough volumes or their LDAC codec which is supposed to improve sound quality.Touch Controls: The touch controls on these are great, especially compared to most other earbuds. They're easy to tap, compared to something like Airpods Pro which I find a nightmare. The controls are also customizable through the app so that you can choose what each tap on them does, it does not get better than this.Sennheiser Phone App: The app for these earbuds is great and full of features, maybe only beaten out by the Sony app though its close in my opinion. Most importantly there is an EQ feature that you can customize, or use one of their custom presets. There's also a sound zones feature that allows you to automatically enable different settings based upon your location, say if you usually use one setting at work and another in your home you can let it automatically change or disable this feature if you prefer.Conclusion: In testing over a dozen pairs of wireless earbuds ranging in price up to $400+ (MW08 Sport, Sony XM4, Sony Linkbuds S, Technics AZ60, Bose QC, and more) this pair of Sennheiser TMW3 clearly is a step above them all. This pair is my personal favorite that I will be using as my primary headphones and 100% my recommendation to anyone I know.",True,Color: Black,[],7.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1568.0,405.0,fiveStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3

Sennheiser beat the Sony XM5s, and the Technics AZ80s SO EASILY, the others should be ashamed to even ask for $50-$80 more. Someone tell their Moms so they feel bad.Winners First: SennheiserListening to the Sennheisers is like having a soundtrack in your head. It has really changed what it's like to listen to music through earbuds. You can envision each individual instrument. It feels as though you have a concert in your head as you're walking around. The music is simply put, BEAUTIFUL.The Others:Both the other earbuds are like having standard edition regular ole' earbuds driving the music right into your ear. A very narrow soundstage (although the Technics were much closer to the Sennheisers than Sony). They of course are very good quality at this price point, but nothing about them seemed any different than just a quality sounding pair of earbuds. Between those two, the Technics were easily better than Sony. The Technics were actually fantastic, sounded much better than Sony and would make a great ""all-rounder"" for someone. BUT, they still sound traditional when it comes to the soundstage. So, Technics are better than Sony clearly, but when you listen to the Sennheisers, you can't go back.Sennheiser Closing Thoughts:One Word, sound stage. A BEAUTIFUL soundstage. They give absolutely wonderful spatial clarity. This freedom for all the vocals and instruments will require you to turn the volume up one or two more notches than others, but that's because the vocals are balanced, wonderfully realistic, and not being PILE-DRIVEN into your eardrum. Quality vocals and instruments should sound further away from where they actually originate, with space around each instrument. Hi-fidelity Speakers with fantastic tweeters in your home will tell the same story. Listening to these earbuds you can close your eyes and listen to individual instruments, cymbals, guitar strings plucks etc. and lose yourself in your music. THAT, is what music is suppose to do.These had extremely clear detailed bass that i LOVED. The Sony's maybe had a little more punch, but in straight comparison the Bass of the Sennheiser was SO much more detailed and fluid. They go CRAZY low. Like, how? Tell me how they do this?!? They have punch, but the actual punch the artist intended. Beautiful bass through and through.If you happened to read all the way to the bottom of this review,  WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE??  go buy themMerry Christmas, and happy shopping!*All listening done through Tidal music, and typical ""smiley-face"" EQ on Sennheiser app*",True,Color: White,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+6yEUm1kL._SY88.jpg'],8.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1568.0,405.0,fiveStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3
5.0,Well implemented feature set and superb sound,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMRB8INFDY7T7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09T8YPFV2,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2022",2022-08-01,United States,,"Disclaimer: I'm not an audio professional or audiophile, but just someone who deeply enjoys good sound.  Take this review on that context.The TLDR; as many other reviews point out, the default sound profile is very good, and I have still not change my eq settings, not even had to apply the bass boost.  Feature wise, transparency mode is outstandingly good and the fact that the touch control distinguish between the two buds give you a lot of possible customization to fit your needs.  A definitely A+ Product.Now, for the full review I'd like to separate audio and feature set sections:Audio:Again, as other reviewers have mentioned, the base sound profile, with a flat 0dB equalizer curve has a very natural frequency response.  In my preferred genre: progressive rock, all instruments and voice are clearly distinguishable and feel very natural.  I did not feel any sound to be overwhelmed by neighboring frequencies.Now, in most of my headphones and speakers I usually enable any bass boost function that is available, so, I was a little surprised when doing so with these buds and finding that the bass drowned some of the sound, so I had to disabled it (first time for everything I guess).  To be fair, this may also be due to the music style in progressive rock.  I suspect, hip hop, which has a lot more emphasis on voice and sharp instruments, may actually benefit from the bass boost.I suspect that I will be playing more with the high frequencies in the equalizer though, again, music style needs.Features:Let's start with the transparency mode.  I tested this functionality in my original Samsung Galaxy Buds a few years back, and was underwhelmed as I got a little of the world sound, but still felt as having headphones covering my ears, so, I could not use them in my day-to-day work.These buds are excellent on that front.  I have seen many reviews comparing them with the Apple ones, stating that they are not as natural, but I feel that if that's the case, the iPods must be outstandingly good, because the transparency mode here is spectacularly good, so, don't let that to be the point that gets you away from the TW3.I was impressed to find out about the Music Zones, which I feel is a very good and inventive use of what is available in your phone, namely, the GPS.  The gist of it is that you can define sound profiles and settings using your location, so, you can have a different setting with enabled transparency by default in the park, when you are jogging, or enabling ANC when you are in the gym, and base sound at home.  My only caveat is that it requires you to register an account with Senheisser, with seemingly no option to just keep those preferences in local storage.  I guess that's their way to have a test bed to refine their audio profiles, but it feels like Senheisser is falling for the cloud trend of wanting to keep your info, which in this case, I feel unnecessary.  Don't take me wrong though, I will use the feature, but I would prefer that, for once, one manufacturer would not be forcing me to store my data with them to use a feature of a device that I already paid for, and that does not require processing that my phone cannot provide.As an extra note, I have not experienced the software issues other reviewers have noted, and I have not tested the battery life, but, to be fair, I just got them a few hours ago.In conclusion, so far, I'm more than satisfied, and should I say, delighted, with this purchase.  These earbuds are worth the full US$250 dollars I paid for them.  Sound is superb, and feature set is creative and works well.  You cannot go wrong with these.Happy listening!",True,Color: Graphite,[],9.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1568.0,405.0,fiveStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3

I was more worried about the sound quality than anything, so I thought I would try them.  I am so glad I did.The setup was a bit more involved than I would have liked.  I paired the earbuds before I got into the app.  My mistake.

The earbuds will not last a full workday on one charge if they are constantly used, but they are fine for sporadic usage throughout the day.Cons:- Bad connectivity. Like very bad.

I use these at the gym and at work, at the gym the natural gym sounds sounds like a fan in the next room over. At work I don't notice any of my coworkers making phone calls or talking among each other.Battery Life is good, it seems to last long enough for most activities,  and the case holds charge well, as I've left them unused for 2 weeks and they still were showing full*.The app is a problem. The required app is not good for troubleshooting any issues and you have to do a lot of troubleshooting.The app has been known for being deceiving, the power display rarely works well, it often shows you connected when you are not (and vice versa), there is debate online that the sliders for sound adjustments don't actually do anything,They update drivers on these commonly (30 minute download and install) and if you don't have the most up to date drivers your earbuds will connect and show everything is good, you just won't get sound. you can use the touch connections to go forward, skip a track, back, volume up, transparency mode on/off, and it will tell you you are connected, but you won't get sound. (and for some reason it wouldn't let me download it unless my battery was above 35%)Large parts of the app are locked behind creating an account, simple stuff like sound testing is unavailable without one.When going from music to a phone call and back to music it messes up the sound. there is a distinct sound difference when you are on a call vs music, and for some reason it doesn't seem to realize you are no longer on a phone call when you resume your music.The Charging case is bad, it looks kind of cool in my opinion, but the earbuds do not settle in easily and often require me double checking if they are charging. For some reason, about 75% of the time i cannot charge them with the case closed, you have to leave the top open or else they wont charge most of the time.You can only charge it using the exact black USB-C connector, I've tested 4 different USB-C connectors and only the one that came in the box actually charges it.They are not sweat proof, after 60 minutes of going hard on a cardio machine I often get terrible sounds coming through the earbuds every 30 seconds or so, very similar to the sounds you get when you sent earbuds through the wash.I regret buying them, and will not be recommending them to anyone going forward, its just too many little problems that cause issues.",True,Color: Graphite,[],2.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,236.0,183.0,twoStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3

I also use wireless earbuds for Zoom and Teams meetings for work, so I basically have earbuds in all day almost every day of the week. My previous experience is with Jabra Elite 75t and the Active 75t, so my perception of these earbuds is colored by my experience using those earbuds.ProsThese are comfortable, sound is very good, battery life is almost double what I get with my Jabra Elite 75t. The app that controls the Momentum 3 (M3) has a cool feature to customize your EQ preferences. This actually changed the way I set the EQ preferences for my other earbuds as I realized that I prefer a brighter sound profile with elevated high frequencies. The App also allows you to customize your touch controls. Multi-point connection works okay with the new firmware update.ConsI like a bit more bass than these offer. There is no way to power the earbuds on and off from the touch controls. The volume control intervals are larger than I would like. Sometimes I want music just barely audible in the background while I'm reading. I found that I wanted the volume to be lower than the lowest audible sound, but one more click to reduce the volume muted the sound completely. It's a minor nuisance, but I have noticed that if I am connected to a second device and I don't have the app open, I cannot connect with the app to manage settings, or even gauge the battery life. Another minor gripe. The battery indicator light seems to have 2 colors to indicate the charge level. It's green when the battery is full and orange after that until the battery is completely depleted. It would be nice to have a third color to indicate that the battery is close to being depleted (I suggest red). Last complaint. The case is larger than I would like. It's almost twice the size of my Jabra Elite 75t case. The M3 case feels bulky in my pocket. I don't like to carry it around in my pocket as a result. Which also exacerbates the problem of not being able to turn them off or on with the controls on the earbuds. If I left the case in the other room or in my car and I need to turn them off for a few minutes while I do something or have a conversation, I don't want to have to leave them on the whole time.GlitchI have owned and used these earbuds for about a week now and they occasionally reboot for no reason. This has happened about 5 times now. One instance when this happened, I was on a call for work. When the earbuds turned on again, they failed to reconnect to the computer I was using. As a result, I missed part of the conversation and had to scramble to try to reconnect manually through the computer applications. It was annoying, and if I'm paying $200 for earbuds, I wouldn't expect this issue. I am wondering if this is a result of the multipoint connection update. Perhaps a future update will remedy the problem. I wonder if others have experienced this problem or if these earbuds are defective.

Unfortunately, this model does not stand the test of time.

I did avoid that problem but beginning of OCT 2023 the left earbud stopped working.  This was a hardware issue and it sounded as if one of the wires became loose.  Intermittent sound to no sound with sound crackling and I would have to jiggle my head or thump my ear to get sound back.  I primarily use my headphones while working out so the constant movement kept jarring it loose or restarting whatever the issue was.

Once they are connected via Bluetooth to my iPhone, iPad or computer - I need to go into the Sennheiser app to change the connection. I can't do that by just trying to connect to Bluetooth. The app can be pretty slow, so this always takes a minute or two - which is annoying if I am trying to pick up a phone call when my earbuds are connected to my computer.They drop calls all the time. I can't think of one phone call I've had with these earbuds that didn't accidentally drop - either when I was trying to get the ear buds to connect to my phone, or because the touch controls are so sensitive, the tiniest touch will end the call.The touch controls are sensitive and easy to touch. Because the whole face of the earbud is essentially a button, if I go to adjust the bud in my ear, I often accidentally stop the music or end the call.My left earbud has developed a high-pitched tone that makes it essentially unusable for calls.

App gives a lot of customization. touch controls are awesome and work.The BAD. I've had 2 Dead on Arrival (DOA) buds. Now after 1 year (out of 2 year warranty) i'm submitting an RMA with Sennheiser for various issues.1. Random batter life issues. Sometimes batter draines within minutes on the buds and I have to reseat them in the case several times for them to charge and atually last the expected length. instead of the 30 min its doing.2. Abnormal heat from buds. Noticed, usually along side battery life issue the buds are really warm in my ear. To the point its uncomfortable. I have to take them off. I've even tried removing them from the charger for a few minutes before putting them in the ears but its still warm. like an overheating lion battery.3. Chirping from buds that really hurts my ears. Apparently these buds have terrible sealing. even the smallest amount of earwax can get through the screen and then shorts out some electronics inside the audio canal. Causing this weird chirping issue. Combine the overheating issue with the sensitive electronics and lack of water/dust proofing you end up with a melted glue that holds the screen in place. This melted glue gets on the electronics and shorts it causing the chirping. Yes you can clean the glue off and temporarily stop the chirping. But then you don't have glue to hold the screen in place and thusly loose whatever little amount of protection to the electronics from your own ear wax/sweat from this.Ultimately, its a terrible design.

Looks good, music sound quality is good with an excellent base compared to my few years old Jabra 65t buds!Negatives:- When on the call, there is a lot of background sound coming through. I never had this problem with my few year old buds or other headphones. It seems like it is increasing the background sound instead of reducing it. I've tried every option in the app, and the problem persists! (I did a factory reset, and it seems like this issue is reduced or resolved!)- Another issue is with the multi device connection. This was a dealbreaker for me, and I only purchased it when I read the update finally enabled multi-device connection. However, this is very buggy!With Jabra this is seamless. For example, if when I'm listening to music on my phone, then I click to watch a video on YouTube, on my laptop, Jabra puts my music on pause, so I can watch the YouTube video. When the video is done, it automatically resumes my music. No input from me is required.With Momentum TW3, sometimes I have to pause the music before playing the video. After the video, I will need to resume the music.Now, this may seem like a nitpicking. But here is when it becomes very frustrating:when I'm listening to music on the phone, if I get a notification on my laptop, it stops the music on my phone. That means if I receive notifications every minute, like when I'm chatting with someone, every time the music stops!Even worse, when I'm on a Zoom call on my laptop, every time I get a notification on my phone I loose up to 30 seconds of the call.I truly hope Sennheiser resolves these issues quickly, or if there is a way for me to fix them, someone helps me out!Update: even when I'm listening to music on my phone and receiving notifications on my phone, the music stops! I searched the internet and their website, found no solution. Ideally, like in the case of Jabra, it should slightly lower the music for a second, so you hear the notification and go back to full volume.

I've only had them for about 4 months. The sound quality was good when I first bought them with nice deep bass and clear/crisp mid and high ranges. The battery life wasn't terrible but if you are in a loud atmosphere and/or playing them louder the time isn't great. The connection strength of these headphones is not very good compared to other high end headphones like airpods. I lose connection about 20-30 feet from the source. After some time the headphones started to chirp and I had to turn off Active noise cancellation and adaptive hearing just to make them usable but the sound quality was worse. Contacted support and they told me to clean them with compressed air. Tried that with no success. Asked for a refund and they mentioned maybe being able to send them in for service.

It is with a heavy heart that I only give 3 stars for the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 (TW3)  earbuds.  I really like the Sennheiser sound profile, and this was the third Sennheiser item I'd purchased, one being wired over-the-ear headphones (HD 4.50) and the other was their wireless over-the-ear headphone, the Momentum 3.I was looking for even more mobility than the over-the-ear Momentum 3, so I purchased these as soon as they were released.  Although not the most comfortable in the ear, they were OK, and the sound was great.  However, over time a few things have become apparent that brought me to this review, a year and a half later.  As a user, I probably had them in my ears 3-4 times a week, no more than about 1-2 hours at a time on average.My issues:1) The earbud holder is a bit bulky, and it doesn't fit in your pocket very well.2)  I noticed while outside the house, the sound would cut out for just a brief moment.  Not sure if this is a TW3 issue or a wifi issue (my phone was clipped to my belt while outside, so it wasn't a range issue).3)  Speaking of range, the range between the earbuds and phone was not as good as I'd hoped it would be.  Other earbuds have proven to have better range in my house.4) This has been reviewed elsewhere by those more knowledgeable, but the noise canceling is good, but not the best.  When I mowed with the TW3s, I needed to put construction ear muffs over the TW3s to block out the noise of the mower to the point where I could listen comfortably.  I recently purchased the Sony WF-1000XM5 true wireless earbuds, and the noise cancellation is much better with me not needing any ear muffs to assist (the XM5s sound is very good, but I do prefer the TW3s for sound).These three issues were annoying, but not dealbreakers as the sound was very pleasing to me and I was able to work around these shortcomings.  However, there is one big issue that I cannot get past.5)  Early on I noticed that if I didn't keep the contacts cleaned, especially on the right earbud, one of the earbuds may not charge at all.  This was really annoying, as it wasn't like my ears were dirty, just the typical wax (I do clean my ears regularly).  It was almost like the wax would prevent the connection, or perhaps the earbud just wasn't making good contact with the charging case.  At first this was really aggravating, but I tried to make sure to clean the contacts regularly, and it seemed to go OK.  However, the last two weeks I have been trying to charge the earbuds, and the right one will not charge at all and it is completely dead.  I have cleaned the right earbud contacts and case contacts several times, but no go.So, because of 5) above, I am giving the TW3s a 3 star rating, and that is mostly because the sound is really good and when they were working they weren't perfect, but they were very good.I have since moved on to the Sony WF-1000XM5s, and, briefly, I can say that the case is slimmer and fits in the pocket fine, the earbuds themselves come with various ear tips and I have found them to be pretty comfortable, once I get them situated, which can be a bit of a pain for me.  The sound is very good, and you can tailor it, but it's not quite up to the Sennheiser in my ears.  The noise cancellation of the XM5s is MUCH better than the TW3s, which was absolutely something I was looking for.Thanks for reading!",True,Color: Graphite,[],1.0,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,243.0,132.0,threeStar,"{'price': None, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3

In addition it comes with a selection of three ear retainers I guess you would call them. I liked the largest of the three because it seated them best in my ear.Next I downloaded the Smart Control app, did the fitting test (I really liked this) and then I did Sound Personalization. This was cool, I am a equalizer person so for me I like my music to sound bass heavy, mids mostly untouched and treble slightly raised. It adjusted to my liking phenomenally well. An equalizer is still available in the form of a five band eq at 63Hz, 250Hz, 1KHz, 2KHz, 4KHz, and 8KHz.What I Didn’t Like.I recently ran into an issue I read about before purchasing these but had hoped to not encounter. My right monitor started making a beeping noise, worst of all it lost quality of audio and volume. I thought perhaps the battery was low so I put it back in and kept just the left one in which sounded good and full still.Despite this attempt it has thus far continued to beep and play poorly. As a result I am returning them.Despite this, I will purchase a new pair but will await my refund before doing so because I loved them while they worked. In the hope to not receive a pair that have this defect.11/23 Update: Dropped from 4 to 3 Stars. Why?The second photo I uploaded is how I somewhat fixed the issue to my right earbud being wonky.If you pull off the rubber tip, beneath is a fine mesh screen. Mine is gone because the glue that held it melted. I wore these at work so I guess coupled with my body heat and the Texas heat it basically made this mesh loose. Triggering some sort of issue with the ANC.The left earbud eventually had the same issue. With the mesh removed the sound is back to being full but it does sometime sound scratchy/raspy.I never got my refund because the only return option given to me was a FedEx pickup, I printed the label and had it properly repackaged but days and weeks went by with it sitting in “Pick Up Scheduled”.I no longer recommend these headphones unless you are sitting in AC.

Until a week ago. The right earbud decided that it had had enough and joined the choir invisible. I tried cleaning the contact points, letting the buds charge in the case while the case was charging, leaving the buds out to drain and recharge them, and an ancient Mesopotamian resurrection ritual that my 25x great grandmother taught me on Christmas. Nothing. It had become an ex-earbud. After some research, I've found this is a more common than it should be problem. But, I get it. I'm also finely tuned and delicate, and perhaps the tribulations of New York City were simply too much for the wee thing to handle. I've sent it for repairs, I will update based on if Sennheiser (now Sonova) actually fixes it or if I have to switch to Sony. Also DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR BOX, if you need to make a warranty claim, they'll want the box (and here I was, so proud of myself for finally throwing boxes away, even though theyre good boxes).This is an initial review done on 2023.07.10, the day on which I received the headphones.The packaging is, in a word, sleek. I was slightly disappointed that the extra silicone tips and wings came in paper wrappings. I suppose it makes a bit of sense, but for the price point it would be nice if the packaging was more oriented towards long-term storage, but 🤷.You'll need to allow the headphones to ""wake up"" by charging the case for <30 seconds. I erred on the side of caution and let them charge for about five minutes. You will want to do any firmware updates before you start listening.I did sound tests using the following: Saint-Saëns' Orgel Symphonie Movement III, Mozart's Don Giovanni: Ossia Il dissoluto punito, Scene Queen's 18+, Dead Can Dance's Persephone, AJR's Burn the House Down,  Dusty Springfield's Son of a Preacher Man, and Pulling Up (Extended) by Soda. All tracks were listened to without adjusting the EQ.This is by far the best pair of headphones I have plugged into my ear holes so far. I have chronic tinnitus, so finding a pair of headphones that don't make the sound muddy or like an amalgamation of indistinct noise can be difficult. The TW3's deliver crisp trebles without sibilance and solid, distinct mids that are truly a joy to listen to. The bass left some to be desired prior to EQ fiddling. In my initial track, the Orgel Symphonie, I actually started to laugh because I could hear mids that I usually wouldn't unless I was in person. So 7/10 for sound quality, we'll see how the bass goes.The comfort levels remained solid, I changed the left bud's silicone tip for a large because apparently I'm lop sided after I experienced some noice leakage (not sure if that's the technical term, but you get it). The large size sealed well, and remedied the leakage. Overall, in the first 24 hours, I am suitably impressed.

First, they don't stay snugly in place.  15 minutes of activity, walking, mowing, yard work, they're getting loose, affecting bass response.  I've tried all the fins and tips.  Even the largest ones.  Don't believe the marketing ads showing people hang gliding, running along a trail, biking up a mountain.  They get loose too much and it's freaking annoying pushing em back in, pulling on my earlobes to widen the ear canal, rotating to catch the fins in place.  Doesn't work.  Second, you have to fiddle with the contacts and case in order to get a true representation of the battery status.  After charging all night I'll still get a 40% bud battery status.

Two-ish years ago I purchased Technics EAH-AZ70W (What a name) and was wow'd by them. Even at the time though what I really wanted was a pair of Momentum TW2's. I figured I was about ready for a new pair and jumped on these. I thought for sure with the Sennheiser name, 2 years newer, and great reviews the upgrade was going to impress me just as much... and... they're... well they're a'ight.What I love: The case! Holy crap I love the case. It feels solid, high quality, and the fabric exterior means I don't have to worry about scratches during transport. Genuinely I almost kept them because of the case.What's good: Just solidly well done overall. Multi-point connectivity. Comfortable fit. Premium feeling finish. Good size. There's an ANC mode specifically for wind which is surprisingly effective.What's meh: ANC. It's there, but not stellar. The biggest deal to me is the sound quality though. It just isn't as good as my previous earbuds. They sound nice. I'm not an audiophile so I don't have the right jargon to describe this, but when I put in my Technics there's a much more visceral feeling to the music. The sounds pop. I can focus and hone in on specific instruments in the track and it feels somehow separate from the others. I don't feel this way with the Sennheisers. The sound comes all at once and I can't pick out the subtler instruments.What's I hate: Switching between ANC modes is awful. Normal is notably better indoors and the Anti-Wind mode is notably better outside, but there's no way to switch between the two on the earbuds themselves. You can't set an action for it! So anytime I want to switch... Pull my phone out -> Unlock -> Open app -> Wait for it to detect -> Click my device -> Scroll down -> Press Wind/ANC.At the end of the day, despite doing a lot of things right they didn't sound better than what I had and quality sound (with ANC) is why I bought them.

TERRIBLE software/ connection issues.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG5FCOUPWYR88?ASIN=B0B4PSQHD5,22 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023",2023-10-05,United States,,"Bought these back in February on sale for $250 after my Jaybirds (I had for nearly 5 years) finally bit the dust. As someone who uses earbuds daily for work, home, and gym; God knows how many hours I had on my Jaybirds listening to music, podcasts, and audio books. I actually felt sad when they broke and had huge expectations with these Bose. They're the first Bose I've ever had and I REALLY wanted to love these.The first month-ish they were great! Getting a new piece of tech years ahead of your previous, you really notice the sound quality, noise cancellation, batter life, and quick charge features.  Unfortunately, that was were the good news stopped.Immediately, I noticed the right earbud is like the main unit. They won't operate independently while the right earbud is in the case which was a bummer not having that feature anymore, since I had this from a product years older, but not a dealbreaker for me.The BIGGEST problem is the connection issues. The software/ Bluetooth in these SUCK. You could have the greatest speakers and noise cancellation features in an earbud ever and it doesn't mean a damn thing if they don't actually connect/ work properly.I've had all manner of problems on this front from the earbuds not connecting in general, to the left/right speaker individually not connecting, or going-out/dropping randomly. Sometimes they'll be working just fine, until you pause whatever you're listening to and then you lose the sound/ connection and have to reset the Bluetooth connection/ put them back in the case and take them out again to get the sound back. There have been times when you place them in your ear and they register they're connected via the echo sound and voice saying so, only for you to wait 10-45 seconds for the sound to actually come through the speakers. I can go on-and-on about this forever, like every other month some new problem with the connection appears.I have a Galaxy S22 ultra so one of the newest/top end phones at the time as I believe the 23s were just about to roll out as I got these earbuds. Kept everything up to date, only device paired, have unpaired and cleared the cache then re-paired with the device, and every other trick Bose recommends on their website for troubleshooting the connection issues... It's still an ongoing issue that has been such a frustration.Another issue I've found was they never stayed in your ears very well. Moving your head suddenly or side-to-side can easily cause them to fall out. I switched the earpieces to the largest size that it comes with but still have problems now and again. I'm sure its a personal thing with the earpiece sizes and you could order 3rd party earpieces that fit better to solve this issue but with the connection issues being what they are, I never bothered investing more $ in a defective product.This leads me to my last issue though, due to previous issues, I never used these earbuds for the gym/ working out/ running. So you'd think that would cut a lot of wear and tear down on the product. Yet, come October here and the hinge on the top cover of the case gave out and broke off.  Luckily the magnets on the earbuds are strong enough to keep them in place in the case to not fall out while in your pocket. But that was it, roughly 8 months of ownership and the case already gave out which caused me to come back and write this review.When they work, they work great, but unfortunately that was short-lived in my case. If you wana roll the dice good luck!Personally, its been such a let down and pain that I will never buy another pair of Bose again after this.",True,Color: Triple BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds II,[],1.0,B0B4PSQHD5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B4PSQHD5?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B4PSQHD5&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,630.0,486.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 182.19, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 279, 'currency': '$'}}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2

I’ve tried all types noise reduction methods while listening with headphones.None take the place from chaotic to silent like these.It’s like magic.UNFORTUNATELY, these are incredibly expensive earpieces and the case flips open easily.Like other brands, if you are busy. Have bad pockets, fumble the case and it drops. Your earpieces are gonna fly. Worse yet, the case will likely fling your earpieces and then snap shut in an instant.Giving you the appearance that the case dropped, nothing more.This happened to me at work, and fortunately it was at my desk. When I got out to the manufacturing floor and opened them up and realized I was missing my buds. I was immediately perplexed! Then I quickly recalled I had dropped the case and upon crawling underneath my desk I was able to locate both earpieces! They flung a surprising distance, to the outter-most edge and appeared to be contained only the walls.A similar thing happened to my coworker. He sported a FAR less expensive and less renowned brand of earbud.He was using his phone to locate his EARPIECE. It made a tone and had location technology (like “find my”) He found his other earpiece that had fallen out in the grass during a kickball game.I dropped my case again on a soft surface. It clapped closed discreetly. I noticed it had slipped out but it’s didn’t register that I could have lost an earpiece.Fast forward to several months later.I use my Bose earbud occasionally. The noise cancellation (the sole reason I purchased them!) doesn’t really make sense with just one.I’ve since bought a couple other pairs.Skull candy and some other inexpensive ones.They clearly don’t have anywhere near the noise reduction capabilities but at least I have both earpieces.I’ve wanted to purchase another pair of Bose but they are just WAYYYY to expensive to purchase if I can’t guarantee they won’t get lost.I just bought a pair of Beats for $80 with decent noice cancellation quality.They’ll work nicely enough.

I noticed many deficiencies while using these, but the worst is that you can't press a button to change which device you're connected to. Stay away if you're using these across your phone and PC.While the noise cancelling is on par with the originals, and the sounds is just fine as well, these features were present on the QC1's but have been REMOVED from the QC2:* There is no wireless charging (I was aware of this before buying)* You cannot change which device you're connected to from the case button (you have to use the app or connect from the desired pc/phone directly)* The battery life indicator is a single LED, which communicates nothing compared to the 5-LED level indicator on the originals* The case is more compact, but it doesn't stand upright like the originals did* It's difficult to remove the earbuds from the case, they are held in with magnets, but sit far too deep past the brim to grab with long nails, or presumably large or dry hands* The earbud shape is awkward to remove from the ear, and to then orient to put in the case* There are fewer gestures and fewer control customizations in the app (you can only customize which side does ""aware mode"" and which side triggers the ""assistant"" and only for a long press, no more double tap gesture)* You have to have the earbuds in the case to pair them to a new device, unlike the originals* The ""starting up"" chime and the voice are more annoying than with the originals* The switch between ""quiet"" and ""aware"" is not always announced* The shape of the earbud is awkward to perform gestures on, compared to the big flat and smooth surface of the originals* The Android app is so bad, but it always has been (note it's the same app as the originals used, only you had more options on the originals) (In my case, it wouldn't connect to the earbuds for like 10 minutes)I was looking for an upgrade to the Bose Quiet Comfort Earbuds 1, but I got a BIG downgrade.

One of those earbuds finally stopped working so I figured I'd give the new ones a go. I've had them for a little over a week now and they are a downgrade in every single aspect other than their form factor and comfort. Instead of giving you my life story, I'll give you what ya want.The connection issues are very real, these things are a nightmare to connect to anything. If you're often swapping devices with them, you're going to have a constant bottleneck in your life which will be getting these headphones to connect to anything. Then after you've finally gotten both earbuds to connect, they will randomly disconnect, for no apparent reason, from time to time too. One last thing about their connection issues: when I was connected to my PC with my old ones, if I had to go to the opposite side of the house or something - yeah they'd disconnect, but when I came back to my PC they'd reconnect seamlessly and it just worked. These not only do not reconnect, they never properly disconnect when out of range so you can't just reconnect them. You have to put them back in the case, mess around with your PC's Bluetooth settings until it says they're disconnected, then you have to go through the tedious process of getting them to connect again. It sucks.Now on to the case, it's trash. Yeah, it's slightly smaller than the other one but it lost wireless charging, doesn't have a latch like the old one, and it is not sturdy at all. It's the case for a $300 pair of earbuds and you could easily snap the lid off of it while putting it in your pocket because it's so flimsy. The headphones have almost non-existent magnets that hold them in the case and there is no latch or magnet for the lid at all. Thus, if you drop this case there is no chance the earbuds will remain in the case. I honestly can't believe Bose released this low-quality product as their ""flagship"" earbuds.Sound Quality - the same as the old model except if you hear something high pitch it will overload the speaker and make a very ""shrill"" noise in your ear that hurts. Overall, the sound quality has gotten worse from the last pair.Noise cancellation - is the same as the last pair, if not a little better because the overall shape, design, and fit of the new earbuds are much better than the first model.A niche issue but actually is the dealbreaker for me and is the reason I'm here giving a detailed bad review: There is not anywhere in the settings to turn the touch buttons off on the earbuds. I often go on long runs outside and once I start sweating, buttons start getting pressed by my sweat. This constantly disrupts my audiobook and my run flow. Now, these headphones are going back and I'll just buy a new pair of the first model QC Earbuds. Another reason I made sure I came and left a truthful review is because of the price point and brand of these earbuds. When you buy Bose, you expect top-quality, premium, dependable products.

The Bose Ear Buds took a bit of an adjustment because it had two fitting adjustments (not just the typical ear canal cushion,  but it also had a second ear 'ring' to help fit in your curvature of the ear.  I got used to it.  But a bit over a month in, just past the Amazon return window, connectivity started flaking. It would say I am connected, but sound would play through my iPad speaker or Samsung phone speaker.  Sometimes it would tell me it disconnected. And when I tried to reconnect, it would tell me to get closer or power on my ear buds (but they were still in my ear and hadnt moved from the 3-4 ft from the device. )Then Sometimes when I would take an ear bud from the case and put it in ear, it wouldn't do the usual ""whanh"" sound that tells me it powered on and checked the ear fitment.  And sometimes it would do it for one ear and not the other.  To work around this, I have had to unpair and repair the ear buds to my various devices. Ive had to reset/forget the list of connected devices.  Sometimes pressing the Bluetooth pair button doesnt work (wont give blinking blue light) and sometimes it would work fine.  It is probably just a coincidence that it started failing right around the 1 month mark where i can not easily return it through Amazon.  It was new and in case looked unused. Not refurbished.

Bad: They only have soft ear plugs, not the locking rings that come with the originals, so in my ear, they fall out when walking, bicycling, at the gym.

I have been using a very inexpensive pair of Tozo 9s, and having read a number of reviews, believed that the noise cancelling would be amazing. However, it turned out to be similar to the Tozo--ok but not fabulous. People have said that they couldn't hear traffic; I used them at night to block out traffic sounds outside, and also simply when walking, but could always hear traffic. Voices also came through, even though I was using Quiet Mode.The battery life was short enough to surprise me. I often use one earbud to listen to peaceful music or stories as I fall asleep. Imagine my shock when a loud voice commented, ""Battery low"" at about 2 in the morning, startling me out of a sound sleep. I had to fumble the earbud back into the case in the dark and then try to get back to sleep.Sticking the earbuds back into the case is a bit of a challenge. They have to be in just right or they won't charge properly. I had to practice putting them in several times before they would finally work. When one earbud doesn't connect immediately, one must put them back in the case, wait for the little light to flash, close the case, wait for the light to stop flashing, and then try taking them out and putting them in one's ears again. Sometimes it took three or four tries to get them to connect.Things I liked: the packaging was beautifully done (although a trifle hard to figure out how to open it). I love the app that checks how well the earbuds are fitting until one gets it right. It tells when one or both earbuds are working, as well. The case is as large as my palm and very smooth--nice feel--although it really is big to carry in a pants pocket. The sound quality is very nice.My chief complaint is that sometimes only one earbud connects and the other one intermittently connects, so the sound will be full one second and then half the next. I have read other reviewers who found that these don't connect well with iPhones, so that may be the problem.Overall, I am returning these, as they are not ten times better than my Tozo earbuds.

As you'll understand if you read my original 3 1/2-star review, there is little about Bose support for this device that would tempt me to believe that contacting the company would be any use at all.When the buds work, the sound is good. But my entire user experience has suggested from the start that there is something very wrong with Bose's management of this product, from its design to its documentation and support. This is not a $200+ product - at least, not in my experience. In fairness, your experience may, of course, be different.BTW, the link to the online English user manual for this product is still in French. When I looked at it more closely, I realized that it is not even for the QC buds - it's for some amplifier or other! If I were responsible for product support at Bose, I'd be making it my business to see that Amazon reviews of my product were read and acted on by someone at the company. This relatively minor problem with the online user manual suggests that Bose doesn't read our reviews .... :(ORIGINAL REVIEW: These were my replacement for my Jabra Elite Pro 7 wireless buds, the left of which gave out less than a year after I bought them (just like it did for many unfortunate purchasers).Let me talk about the pros of the Bose earbuds first:1) Excellent  fit in the ears;2) Excellent, full, warm sound (though I qualify this a little below);3) Ability to connect to up to 8 devices. The buds remember those devices, so the moment you select the Bose earbuds in your device Bluetooth app they'll connect. Easier than either of my Jabra sets;4) Magnetic, so won't fall out of case;5) Can be ""recognized"" by your device as soon as you open the case - you don't need to take them out;6) Friends says that the call quality on their end is excellent;7) Works fine with Windows devices - something that Jabra still doesn't seem to be able to do;8) The buds appear to remember your various settings even if you use them with a device that doesn't have the app. Very good!9) You can use one earbud (e.g. for phone calls);10) Noise canceling is excellent.A word here about the sound quality, which I wouldn't class as either a pro or a con. The buds seem to me to be very bass-heavy, but in saying that I'm aware that the tight fit of this sort of earbud design is so much a part of bass response that it might be my fit, though it is entirely comfortable, is too tight. I run the bass end of the equalizer at about -4 (db? - there's no volume unit specified).OK, now having said that, the bass response seems to me to extend way down the spectrum in the orchestral music that I listen to. You can almost feel the resonance of the bows on the double-basses, or the movement of the air when the bass drum is struck. Far and away more satisfying than any other in-ear phones, wireless or wired.Now for the cons. Some of these are simply eccentric design decisions. Some of them suggest sloppiness in overall product management or integration into the overall product experience.1) The fit in the case is peculiar. Getting them out requires an odd pinching of forefinger and thumb, and I can't take out the left bud with my right fingers - I have to use the left hand. Similarly, stowing the buds isn't intuitive at all, either in the left-right axis or top-bottom axis. I'll probably get used to it, but it's definitely a little strange. I have the glossy black ones, so there are no tell-tale shadows in the case to guide the eye;2) There doesn't seem to be any obvious way of determining how they work when you first open the package. There's a small QR code, but that gives information about installation, not use. If you go to the Bose website (at the time of my writing this review) and download the user guide in English, it turns out to be in French! And at least one of the web links from the app is dead.3) Controlling the buds involves touching the outside of the buds in various ways: brief touch, long touch, or a slide of the finger. This has the advantage of being ""solid-state"", as opposed to a clickable switch that can wear out. But the buds sit far enough out from the ears that knowing exactly where that ""touchable"" area is to be found can be difficult. And that is a problem, because a tentative slide (change the volume) can be interpreted as a touch (stop/start) - you need to be confident.4) The app is poorly designed. Here's an example: You can connect the buds using your regular Bluetooth connection, although the app supposedly will do it for you. If you have connected without using the app, however, then the app doesn't know you've connected ... and you won't be able to do anything else with the app until that connection takes place. And I've not found out yet how to delete the ""Work"" profile I created at the app's suggestion ....5) There is a young woman in my earbuds, and when she talks to me about battery strength she sounds bored to death. I'm not surprised, since she insists on telling the the name of the device I've connected to, and the default name of Windows devices is a long and incomprehensible string of gibberish ....OK, here's the summary.I like the sound and the fit, and I'm glad I bought them.However, the overall attention to the user experience doesn't suggest Bose to me, or any sort of premium product for that matter. At $149 they'd be a no-brainer. At their present price, which suggests a luxury experience, I think they're too expensive.",True,Color: Triple BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds II,[],1.0,B0B4PSQHD5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B4PSQHD5?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B4PSQHD5&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,1112.0,809.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 182.19, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 279, 'currency': '$'}}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2

This also means I evaluate them deeply and am deeply sensitive to quality.  You will get no better review of the experience of these buds than mine. I've had my buds for over a year, it's Nov 3 2023 (I update this every time they trigger another meltdown, to show how consistently broken these things are and how Bose doesn't give a crap to fix it - this is NOT an old review, and these are STILL broken, not once have they worked since April 2022 when I got them brand new, they come out the box BROKEN), and over a year later they continue to be the worst purchase I ever made. Bose continues to do nothing to make it right, $300 set on fire and customer service doesn't exist.These aren't quality, these are garbage.  They are torture devices that can easily trigger dangerous mental health episodes.  I've been hurt deeply by them, I talk to my therapist about the pain they cause.These things do not work.  For $300, you get little inert stones to shove in your ears over and over.  That's what these are.  Sometimes, some days, you get lucky and maybe one earbud connects and turns on, but the other won't.  Eventually, the broken earbud _will_ start working, but you know what?  Now the other is broken.  You will shove these things in and out of your ears, in and out of the case, for 30-60 minutes a day, at various random times throughout the day.  You will put them in and out of the case.  You will load up the _USELESS_ and BROKEN app that does nothing but confuse you and break things more.  You'll re-pair the device.  You'll turn every bluetooth device in your entire house off and on, over and over.  You will connect, disconnect, connect.  Over and over.You will do this every single day.  Every day, you'll try popping these in, thinking for $300 they will be engineered by competent people that have figured out the decades-old tech we call Bluetooth, but Bose doesn't have that level of engineering.  Those insufferable idiots cannot figure out _Bluetooth_.  What an absolute $300 joke.  And they force you to get a SECOND app.  You liked the one you had for your headset?  TOO BAD!  You get TWO FREAKING APPs.  And the new one is nonfunctional theater.  It does nothing but try to upsell you and steal your data.Bose hates you.  Bose engineers garbage.  Do not waste your money on this absolute trash that a child engineered.  This is a scam.  Bose is a joke.  No reason to have earbuds that never work, that cannot be relied upon.  DO NOT BUY THESE.I came to update this review to add that they are still broken, daily, in all the ways I say above, but now at least once a week I have to completely re-pair across every device, do a factory reset.  The buds actually DO finally turn on, both are working, but NO SOUND, NO CONNECTION.  The buds function, but no device can connect to them.  No sound at all.  These are getting _WORSE_ with time.  Worse with updates.  AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS, THEY DO NOT HAVE BASIC FUNCTION! you _cannot_ rely on them _AT ALL_.  Some of the worst engineering I have every encountered, and I am a veteran engineer myself.  Farcical trash.I came to update this to say in addition to ALL of the problems above, they've recently started to just fail in the middle of use, sound stops and connection suddenly fails.  Full battery, bluetooth is connected, I'm hearing whatever I'm listening to, and then it just fails.  I have to go through the 30-60 minutes of torture I describe above.These things do not work.  And get worse the second after warranty expires.  Only buy these if you don't need earbuds you can rely upon and $300 is something you are happy to set on fire.They've abandoned this product for Ultra (a cash grab product with no real notable improvements, released for no reason other than to justify tossing all of the qcii customers in the street).  I wasted $300 and they'll never make it right.

I work on a loud environment as a mechanic so my hands get dirty often. I primarily bought this product to use at work so I don’t need to grab my phone on calls and for noise canceling. I owned AirPod Pros prior.The good: Sound quality (speakers) just as every Bose product I ever had, great quality. Noise Canceling: I’ll tell you the good now and the bad below. When noise canceling kicks in it’s like you when to a different universe, by far much better than AirPods. Battery life is great too, I charge it once a week before I start work and it last the whole time. They are also pretty comfortable, with my AirPods I had to take them off every hour or so, not sure why but my ears would hurt.The Bad: Microphone SUCKS, no one ever understands me, even in a quiet room people always say I sound like garbage, compared to my AirPod that was much better. The touch pads (or how you interact with the headphones) you tap once to play/pause and it raises the volume, you tap it again because now someone is half way thru a conversation and it skips the song, so you end up having to take it off and pray then it pauses the music or you have the other headphone in your ear full blast while you trying to understand this half as conversation. I hate this so much if they weren’t so expensive I would have burn them already. Lastly the noise canceling: while earlier I said it was the best there is something sucks. This headphones have a cool feature that even if you have in “transparent mode” (not canceling noise) if something loud are you starts happening then it will automatically change to noise canceling… I’m not sure if this is the reason why but say that you have noise canceling on and someone is hammering next to you it lets that sharp sound in, if you get next to a very loud engine it lets in like very high pitch specks of sound and it hits you right in the brain. I have not yet found a solution to this, I tried turn off that automatically feature and couldn’t figure it out. Last, the case, when your fingers are bit sweaty or we in anyways getting the headphones out of the case is not a seem less thing, you have to go at it sideways pinch it with your fingers… it’s weird that’s allThe reason for the low reviews: this is a very expensive product from a brand you expect the best quality. The goods are very good, but the nada are very bad and so many of them. If this was a cheap $100 Bose headphones at least I knew I was buying their cheap stuff but for $300 I don’t find it acceptable.

Everyone always lauds Bose and I have never owned anything from Bose and figured this would be a worthwhile investment.I read that the Bose wireless app is a pain to people and so I was prepared for that. Connecting the earphones via the app wasn't as daunting as I expected the process to be, but I do wonder why it is necessary at all since all other bluetooth earphones I have ever had simply connect through the operating system's bluetooth interface.Anyway, I got the earphones calibrated and all was great for a couple of months.A couple of weeks ago, the earphones began to cut in and out intermittently. Others have done this when I've walked by construction sites or a presidential motorcade has driven by and I didn't think much about it.Then, the noise canceling began to stop. It took me a couple of days to realize I could go to the app and turn it back on—but why was it turning itself off at all? I purchased these primarily for the noise cancelation feature. The noise cancelation from that point on stopped working unless I turn it on manually through the app.Then my earphone told me my battery was at 10 percent, which was weird. I charged the earphones, but they didn't charge. I did a hard reset and I plugged them into my computer to update the firmware, as per instructions I found online from Bose. The earphones worked again for a couple of days, but then I missed a couple of calls and realized that the earphones were staying connected to the phone even when I close the case, which always had previously disconnected them. Because they stay connected, the battery drains when I put them away. The only way to disconnect them from the phone is to turn off the bluetooth from the phone's settings—but even that does not disconnect them as far as the earphone case knows, and so the battery continues to drain.I plugged in my case yesterday around noon. It is now 6am the next day. I put the earphones in and...""battery at 10 percent.""I can't believe that earphones have consumed so much of my time. I don't have time to be a Bose earphone owner, and I'm bothered that I spent hundreds of dollars on such a shoddy product. The sound quality and noise cancelation are great, but when the earphones only worked properly for two months, and the battery constantly drains itself, the earphones won't disconnect, and the noise cancelation constantly turns itself off, they're not good for anything at all.

I've always been impressed by the level of noise cancelling they're able to achieve in their products.  When I saw that a new QC set of earbuds had hit the market I took it as an opportunity to upgrade from my current JBL Tour Pro earbuds to the Bose.  This is my third QC product, I also own a pair of the QC700 over the ear headphones.With all that as a background my experience with the ridiculously bad handling both the earbuds and headphone have on Bluetooth connectivity I would stay well away from Bose.  Great audio and noise cancelling aren't worth anything if you cannot connect to it reliably from your devices!Pros:- Noise Cancelling- Sound QualityOk:- Aware mode (copying transparency mode from Apple).  Not as good as the Apple Air Pods Pro, but passable.  Don't buy these for this feature if you own and iPhone, Air Pods are way better.Bad:- Bose requires you to use their Bose Music app to connect their earbuds to your phone.  In my experience with both the QC700 and QC ii earbuds this is a horrible experience.  New out of the package, connecting to stock Android on a Pixel 6Pro it took me 30 minutes and as many connection attempts/ phone restarts, etc. to successfully get them to pair.  This mirrors the experience I had with the QC700's, the Bose Music app does a horrible job managing the bluetooth functionality.  Why they don't use the stock bluetooth functionality is beyond me.- Once connected, the earbuds do not reliably reconnect to a device when removed from the case.  It works sometimes but if it doesn't you are required to open the Bose Music app before your phone connects to the earbuds.- Connecting the earbuds to my secondary phone (iPhone SE 2022) the experience worked on the first attempt, however, the earbuds would not stay connected to the phone.  In a Facetime call no sound was present from the earbuds with bluetooth selected as the source, and the iPhone would keep switching sources back to the native phone speaker due to unresponsiveness of the earbuds.Final thought:  Bose does a great job with noise cancellation, and sound quality.  However they clearly don't know much of anything about app development and bluetooth management. Requiring the use of a mobile app to access your headphones is bad design. Its a shame that a good legacy of audio experiences is rendered practically useless through poorly performing software.My recommendation: if you own an iPhone get the AirPod Pro, for Android owners check out the Sony  WF-1000XM3, Sony has been catching up to Bose on ANC for a while now and provide a significantly better user experience.",True,Color: Triple BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds II,[],5.0,B0B4PSQHD5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B4PSQHD5?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B4PSQHD5&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,1112.0,809.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 182.19, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 279, 'currency': '$'}}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2

I have several pairs of Bose headphones to include the sports earbuds, the QC limited editions and a pair of the sound links from almost a decade ago and none of them have had the same connectivity issues, the issues where rather than the intended noise, there was a high whistle sound in one earbud at a time. There were times where the only way I could get the headphones to connect at all was to connect with another pair of Bose headphones, namely the sports earbuds and then connecting to the QC earbuds right after. The quality of the products seems to have dropped a decent bit. Between these my Bose sports earbuds, my Powerbeats and all my other headphones which have been rained on, drenched in sweat, etc. these headphones, which have ONLY been used for work, school and everyday use, have been the worst. The previous generation didn’t have these issues even when I slept with them, ran with them, blasted them at max volume for hours at a time, etc.. These headphones which were treated the BEST out of all my headphones have shown the greatest issues despite taking care of them , not wearing them to workout, not blasting them, not sweating with them, not sleeping with them in, and a million other things that I normally would’ve done, because I wanted these to last forever and be my casual headphones for school, work, reading etc.To reiterate do not buy unless you are willing to spend hours troubleshooting a temperamental pair of headphones that refuse to maintain connectivity, and basic functionality.

Bose has a reputation for quality sound, so I was excited to try the Bose Quiet Ears 2. Unfortunately, they didn't live up to my expectations.Connectivity Issues: The Quiet Ears 2 had major challenges connecting seamlessly to multiple Apple devices. Switching between my iPhone, iMac, and iPad was anything but smooth. This was especially problematic during Zoom or Teams calls when I needed to switch devices. The headphones often failed to pair, or only one ear would connect, leaving me to manage calls on just one ear.Playback Hiccups: Using them while walking my dogs and trying to enjoy music or podcasts became a frustrating experience. If you remove one earbud, the playback stops. Sometimes it resumes when you put the earbud back, but often, I found myself having to manually press play on my phone. The touch controls were unpredictable at best.Comparison to AirPods While the sound quality might be on par with Apple's AirPods, the overall experience falls short. The two are similarly priced, but their performance isn't comparable. Sound quality alone doesn't define a product's worth, especially when there are functional deficiencies.Customer Support I wanted to provide this feedback directly to Bose, but navigating their customer support felt like wading through a bureaucratic maze. The absence of direct email support and an offline chat service was disappointing.On a Positive Note, I've had a great experience with Bose's sunglasses that come with an integrated soundtrack. They're discreet and user-friendly, proving that I generally appreciate Bose products. The pause, forward, and rewind functions work flawlessly.Final Thoughts While I have a soft spot for Bose due to my positive experiences with other products, I can't recommend the Quiet Ears 2 for Apple users.

5.0,Love These Buds! Bose Does Not Disappoint.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XH7LY0UX5S34/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4PSQHD5,10 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023",2023-12-10,United States,,"I've had Bose Soundsports for 6 years. Sound quality has been amazing. I gave them tons of use (gym, yard care, etc) but it's time for new buds. I started looking at Bose products because of the sound quality. But the new rings they use for ear fit concerned me. How will they stay in my ears during workouts without the effective 'wings' I'm used to on the Soundsport? Short answer: They stay in great. I switched out the earpieces and rings to customize the fit and after 2 hardcore trips to the gym, I have no issues with fit. Comfort was also great after 90 minutes of continuous use.I had concerns about connectivity after reading the reviews. I initially freaked because I had an issue right out of the box. The left bud wouldn't immediately connect and the tap control features on the buds were not consistently working. However, I downloaded and installed the software update and I've had no connectivity issues since. They are working flawlessly with my iPhone 14 Pro.I'm not concerned about battery life because I only use buds for a couple hours at a time. However, I will join others in questioning Bose for not including wireless charging as a standard feature. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but it would be nice to have without dropping more $ on a new case.I'd also like to give kudos to Amazon. I ordered these at 6pm with an expected delivery time of 5a-8a the next morning. They arrived at 10p the same night I ordered. Impressive. Had them ready to go for a trip to the gym the next day.

5.0,These are the best headphones on the market 4/23,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8P8WII8HBQI0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4PSQHD5,227 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023",2023-04-03,United States,,"As of April 2023, these are by far the best ear buds on the planet. I live in my ear buds.. every day, almost all day I have them in watching videos and streams and some music so I always splurge on what the reviews say are the best. I had the Sony XM4s for 13 months and I used them every day until their battery very quickly went from lasting 6 hours to 4 to literally 1 hour. Their warranty is 12 months and at 12 months and 1 day, they won't honor it. Had to throw them away after 13 months.I was extremely impressed with those so I was actually shocked when I first put these QC 2s in my ears...-The noise cancelling is revolutionary. Like, actually a game changer. I have $1200 noise cancelling aviation headsets and they don't come close to these never mind the XM4s. It makes every other noise cancelling I've experienced seem like a gimmick toy by comparison, it's actually a strange sensation is so amazing.-the sound isn't even comparable to anything else. These are night and day way better than the XM4s and every other ear buds I've ever heard. The base actually sounds like a crisp powerful sub woofer with in depth deep powerful notes when listening to explosions or music. It's just a powerful and full sound without any lacking areas.-they are extremely comfortable, so were the XM4s. It's kind of a wash here because I could have both in my ears for 10 hours and be happy and I probably readjust them just as often as any other bud at the gym.-they look cool, better than the girlie XM4s that had that rose gold jewelry look that I had to sand down and paint black. These are masculine and nice right from Bose. On the bigger side but couldn't care less for the noise cancelling and auditory performance.-the app and controls kinda suck, not going to lie. Had some connectivity issues with the app and had to reset the buds for it to connect to them. You need the app to connect to them change any settings.. I find it annoying that you can't turn the controls off or customize any of the touch shortcuts. I had much cheaper buds with completely customizable touch controls and the app would let you turn off all or any singular touch control you don't want for any situation. Bose, epic hardware, just hire one good software guy too.-the only actual problem and complaint I have with these are you can't turn off the noise cancelling or noise enhancing feature entirely. If you are on a motorcycle or in heavy wind, noise cancelling buds give loud feedback and the XM4s allowed you to turn that off but still get audio, these are always on.Again, epic hardware, hire a software guy.Overall, nothing even comes close to these ear buds regardless of the mediocre software attached to them that you will almost never use after initial setup. That being said, they should solve that issue cause it's not very hard to do and for $300 and the best hardware on the market, a good fully customizable software program to go with them would really seal the deal and complete the package.",True,Color: Triple BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds II,[],2.0,B0B4PSQHD5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B4PSQHD5?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B4PSQHD5&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,6453.0,1598.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 182.19, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 279, 'currency': '$'}}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2
5.0,Thrilled with my first pair of wireless earbuds.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SJJD9Y53KJI7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4PSQHD5,224 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2022",2022-11-30,United States,,"This is my very first purchase of wireless earbuds (well, I purchased 3 others at same time, to compare them to each other). I did a decent amount of research in a short period of time, and landed on three of the highest rated. These, the Sony WF-1000XM4 and the Beats Fit Pro. I'll start by stating that I haven't felt compelled enough to actually write a review in years. I was so afraid these would disappoint me based on other reviews and Reddit threads, but after just a couple minutes listening to music with these and the Sony earbuds - I had determined an easy winner. I didn't even bother opening the Beats Fit Pro because I knew there was no way they wound better than Bose. My previous earbuds were Bose Soundsport (a gift from someone), so maybe I just have some bias because I'm accustomed to the sound that Bose delivers. My only other prior experience with ANC wireless earbuds is Apple Airpods Pro (I think first generation?) and all I remember when I tried them is instantly thinking the music quality wasn't even close to my Soundsport. Which is a good segue into my Pros and Cons list.PROS:1. Sound/Music quality. I'm not educated on all the components of sound/music, I don't know the exact science of what's what, I only know what sounds good to me. I know when music sounds ""full bodied"" and that's how I'd describe these/the Bose sound. The bass especially. I love Bose bass.1. Comfort. One of my biggest gripes with the Bose Soundsport was the fit/the wing tips. I HATE the wing tips, even with the smallest size they would cause soreness in my left ear in less than hour. In contrast, I LOVE the way these fit/feel. I have worn them for 3+ hours with zero discomfort. And that's with the size that they came with, I haven't even tried the other sizes yet to see if they can be even more comfortable.2. Noise Cancelling. Again, I'm not highly educated/experienced in this area (Soundsport didn't have ANC), but I can tell these do it well. I blow-dried my hair while listening to music and I couldn't hear the blowdryer at all (I did have my music up to max/near max volume), but still. I did try to compare this feature with Sony's, and either Sony's ANC was malfunctioning (I researched and troubleshooted), or it was just really bad in comparison to Bose.3. Easy set-up/sync. Scanned a QR code, downloaded the app, and boom, I was connected. I've had zero connection issues. (I have a Galaxy S21+).4. Aesthetic. I like how they look. I didn't like the weird knob thingy on the Sony, and I don't like the very obvious ""b"" Beats logo that's on the Bits Fit Pro, so I am extra grateful that I ended up liking these the most, because I also like how they look the most.CONS:1. Hiss/static noise. One of the biggest complaints I saw people have with these is the faint static/hiss noise (when no music/sound is playing), particularly when in Aware mode (ANC turned off). And yes, mine make the noise, and it can be heard even if music is playing at a very low volume, and yes it's annoying, but when I considered how infrequently I would have my earbuds in but not have any music/sound playing (or have volume low enough to hear the static), I determined that's really not a deal breaker for me, and it doesn't outweigh the pros.2. At first they were a little difficult to remove from the case, but I have quickly gotten better at knowing where to grab/how to remove.NEUTRAL FOR NOW/WILL UPDATE LATER:1. Call/mic quality? In my research I also came across a lot of complaints about call quality, people say that the other person on the line can barely hear them/there's a lot of noise, etc. For me, I literally didn't even consider this a factor in my decision making, because I barely care. It's not my primary purpose or use for my wireless earbuds. However, I'll eventually test it out and will update my review later with my experience.2. Touch controls. I'm new to this, so it could just be a learning curve, but every so often I have trouble getting the touch controls to respond or do exactly what I want. I like it, I think it's neat, and I'm sure I'll get better at it, but I also expect touch controls in general to be finicky on occasion.CONCLUSION:While I would recommend these to anyone, I do believe the best choice for everyone is going to be different, and that it's important to know what your priorities are, what annoys you more, etc.For me personally, the primary purpose of my earbuds is for enjoying music for relatively long periods of time, oftentimes while engaging in physical activity/chores, so sound/music quality and comfort are my two greatest priorities, so for my purposes, I am absolutely thrilled with these.",True,Color: SoapstoneStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds II,[],3.0,B0B4PSQHD5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B4PSQHD5?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B4PSQHD5&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,6453.0,1598.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 182.19, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 279, 'currency': '$'}}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2

Starting off, the sound quality is superb (as to be expected from Bose). They are tuned very bass forward for a Bose product though. This isn’t to say it’s bad thing though, you’re still getting tons of clarity in the mids and highs, but just with a really nice, punchy bass. Every time you take them out of the case and put them in your ears you’ll hear what sounds like a cello chord. This is how these bad boys tune the audio to sound as accurate as possible for YOUR ears, and it works like magic. And the anc? Holy crap, it’s next level. It literally drowns the entire world out, and I barely have to have my volume past halfway. The only downside I can think of is there’s no way to turn off anc or transparency mode. It’s always gotta be one or the other. There’s certain times where I’d prefer to have everything off completely, but definitely not a deal breaker, considering you can choose the level of cancellation you want.

5.0,Truly cancel out 100% of the noise,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BC31YP5VEAIZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4PSQHD5,262 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2023",2023-04-22,United States,,"These headphones are without a doubt the best headphones I have purchased so far in my entire life. I say thus far, because I know that technology is able to continue to become greater and greater as we advance through time, but as of 2023 these headphones are so packed with technology that they meet every need that I could want out of headphones, and additionally have some extra really cool perks.I want to talk first about the number one need that I wanted these headphones to meet. They claimed that they had 100% noise canceling and I can confirm that that is absolutely correct. Closing out the loud outside world is something that is real true need of mine. I live in a major city, and everything is so loud that I can barely concentrate. I can't go to the grocery store, out to eat, for a walk down the road, or sometimes even sit in my own home without having some sort of overpowering noise that I don't want to hear.So here's how these headphones work noise canceling-wise. I'll give you two scenarios.Scenario one, I have had a hard day and had to talk to people all day. I'm hungry, tired, don't want to talk to anyone or hear anyone's voices. I go to my favorite fish restaurant because I'm too tired to cook but I know that I'm going to need some peace and quiet when I get there. I place my food order, then sit down at my table in a very noisy environment with lots of peoples conversations going in the background. Relaxation is just about to begin. I take out my Bose headphones, I insert one into my ear, and then immediately I hear this sound that sounds like a lightsaber. That's the Microphones in the headphones testing the ear seal to make sure sound doesn't get into the headphones. I insert the second headphone into my other ear, and hear another lightsaber like sound. For about two more second I can still hear peoples voices and then all of the sudden I hear a ""beep"" and everyone's voices fade away! The noise cancelling has kicked in, and it's time for me to enjoy my dinner with some relaxing peaceful music. I'm now sitting in the middle of a restaurant and I can only hear my music and no one's voices at all. Sometimes I'll turn my music off in the middle of the restaurant, and I'll watch funny Instagram videos in the headphones. Usually after a 20 minute meal and some funny videos, I'm so relaxed and happy even after a hard day's work, that I'm ready to go home and go to sleep.Scenario two. I live next to a very busy major street. I can hear lots of road noise, exhaust, loud stereos, and many other kinds of noises. I like to take walks and relax. It's not very relaxing walking when I have to hear a lot of these noises. I insert my bose headphones , and all of the road noises fade away. All I can hear once again is my music. I have to make sure that I stay on the sidewalk when walking, because these headphones cancel out noise so well that if I try to walk on the road, I'll likely get hit by a car because I will not hear the cars driving near me.So that being said, the main thing I love about these is the noise canceling. I mentioned that there were couple cool extra things about these that I wanted to tell you about. I do like the amount of bass that these headphones are able to produce. It's way more than I expected. Additionally the clarity on these headphones is so good that I can can barely describe it in words. There is a treble mode, and a bass mode within the app so I can choose between these two modes and intensify the kind of clarity and or bass that I'd like.The charging case is a medium to small size. It fits well then my pants pocket and doesn't get in the way when I'm in the gym. That's one other thing that I wanted to make sure I told you about, is that these are the perfect headphones for the gym. I've seen several other people in the gym with them on, and now I know why. They don't move around in my ears at all! I work out very intensely, and if headphones were going to move around then they would move around on me. They stay exactly where I put them even though I'm sweating on them non-stop for over an hour each day.I love everything about these headphones. My only regret is that I let the price of these scare me away for so long, and I didn't order them soon enough.",True,Color: SoapstoneStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds II,[],5.0,B0B4PSQHD5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B4PSQHD5?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B4PSQHD5&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,6453.0,1598.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 182.19, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 279, 'currency': '$'}}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2

5.0,The first ANC earbuds that actually are noise-cancelling when you need it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37FAQRSJF2RYW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4PSQHD5,104 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2022",2022-09-25,United States,,"Browsing my order history going back to 2015 I've had 4 pairs of cheap wired earbuds.My favorite headphones are the Sony over ear WH-1000XM4. I tried the WH-1000XM5's and still liked the older model better. The Sony's spoiled me for their noise-cancelling ability. I fly for work almost every week. When I got this job the first thing I did was research headphones and picked up the 1000XM2's and loved them.I've been hunting for a pair of wireless noise-canceling earbuds for a few years. I tried Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus, Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Pro, and now these Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.I wasn't expecting much from the Samsungs and they lived up to my expectations. I returned them. The Sennheisers were the greatest sounding earbuds I have ever heard, but they were uncomfortable and the noise cancelling was poor. The Sony earbuds were also poor at noise cancelling and didn't sound that great to my ears, especially compared to the over the ear models I love. They were also finicky and uncomfortable.I never seriously considered the Bose options in the headphones / earbuds game. ""No highs, no lows, must be Bose."" The Bose sound has always been my least favorite. Clear, midrange, just baffling why people like it. Maybe my ears are damaged, but just not for me. Then I read a review. I took the plunge. No kidding - the noise cancelling on these is as good as the Sony over the ear models.My test for noise cancelling is taking the earbuds for a walk. I do a few miles around the neighborhood every day - and after the Sony's entered my life, the 'clomp clomp clomp' of my footsteps with any other earbud/headphone has driven me crazy. I put these on last night and played a few tracks on TIDAL Master quality - Beatles, Prince, some classical, and there it was. That midrange Bose sound that drives me batty. I switched between these and the Sony's - and the Sony's sound great with no tweaking. They just sound great. I have fallen in love with pipe organ recordings because of the Sony's I think. I love the way the recordings sound and feel in the Sony's. No way these Bose are going to cross this hurdle of sounding like Bose. It's just what they are, not my taste.This morning I tweaked the EQ on my phone to make the Bose less Bose-sounding, and started on my walk, and I couldn't hear my footsteps. I COULDN'T HEAR MY 'CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP.' Oh my goodness. Why do these have to be Bose! These things are a miracle. A MIRACLE. So I dug into my phone's sound settings a little more and saw they have different sound settings for people, depending on their age. I clicked on my age (none of your business!) and the Bose sounded better. More in line with what I'm used to. I played a pipe organ piece and it didn't sound as full as the Sony's but it was fine. It passed my test.I have read the Bose doesn't use the fancy high quality codecs the Sony's use. I could hear sound degradation on quieter passages of a classical recording - but I looked at the recording and it was on a not top-tier label, so maybe it was just an average recording. But the bottom line is- after returning several pair of earbuds for the reasons spelled out above, I am actually going to keep these.I discovered the Bose app has it's own EQ which tweaks the sound a little better than my phone's. There is also a mode where it cancels the sound I want canceled ('clomp clomp clomp'), yet I could hear cars approaching and my feet crinkling leaves in the street.

They came in 60% charged which was great cause i wanted to try them out immediately. Simple set up with the software and connectivity and once that was done i put them on and they fit very well.I run a fan and an air cleaner in my room since I live in the middle of the city, so my room is usually noisy; once i put on the headphones it took a minute, but the sound cancellation kicked in without me realizing it was a default setting. For a moment i thought we lost power to the rooms cause the noise from the fans just gradually vanished!

When they work, which is irregularly, they are the best noise cancelling earbuds I've used bar none and I've used pretty much everything made by Sony, Samsung and Bowers & Wilkins. They are a bit bass heavy but that can be equalized out when listening to music. The major problems are three different connection issues and then eventually the death of the right ear bud. First, they don't sit well in the case which meant I had to adjust the stabilizer band and often tap the right ear bud to make sure it was seated. If not, you will lose the ability to connect to anything as everything connects through the right ear bud. Second, I would lose the left earbud sound at least 3x per week mostly when going from WiFi to cellular coverage. That would be fixed by putting the earbuds in the case for 10 seconds and then putting them back on. However, even that would occasionally lead to loss of the left earbud multiple times on a 15 minute walk. If I charged them for more than 2 hours, I would also often lose the left ear bud connection.About once every 1-2 weeks, I'd have to hard reset these, which meant that I would have delete the QC Earbuds ii from the app and the phone and then charge the case and hold the connection button for 25 seconds while doing so. The issue here is that if you don't have a USBc cable with you that you can use to charge the case, this won't work. You would then re-pair the device through the app and to the phone and then it would work. However, the last time I did that today, it would no longer connect to anything as the right ear bud won't recognize the contact in the case.Finally, the app is garbage. About 20% of the time even when working to play music the app didn't recognize the earbuds. I have a bunch of Bose products that have lasted forever. This one is really disappointing, which is made worse by the fact that it is really a wonderful device when it works.Update: I sent them back and received a new set of earbuds that for the past month have worked fine. For these, I've taken three different new approaches. I don't use them with any other device except my cellular phone. I found that they would often drop the connection if I had another device paired to the earbuds that was on. I don't do that any longer. I purchased a case to put the case in as I've found that dropping the case causes the earbuds to lose their ability to sit in the case which makes these no longer functional. Finally, I'm very careful when handling these buds as they don't tolerate being dropped.

I was upgrading from a less expensive noise-canceling pair because the noise-canceling on those was okay but not amazing. I tried to do my research because these aren't cheap, and I am a fan of Bose products.The pros: the sound on these was really good, and so was the noise-canceling. I liked that I could customize the controls for each earbud, to a point, and I liked how well it drowned out ambient noise when I activated the noise canceling. Even when I didn't have music playing, they would still muffle the sounds around me. The touch controls did take a minute to get used to, but it was nice to be able to control the volume from the earbuds, which is something I couldn't do on my old pair.Now the negatives.The connection problems that everyone talks about are valid. I only used these with my phone, and after a week they started to get weird with connecting to it. I tested the connection with one earbud, both earbuds and the problem seemed to be if I was consistently taking one in and out of the case. It's worth noting that the range on these if I walked away without my phone, was not very far.Another complaint I saw in the comments was the voice assistant that talks to you. I personally didn't have a problem because if you have any other product in the Bose family, namely the speakers, it's exactly the same with announcing the battery life and when you're connecting to a phone. The voice also doesn't come in too loud so that was not a concern for me.At the end of the day, the reason I returned them was because the earbuds were painful for me to wear. I tried every combination imaginable with the given interchangeable parts. None of them solved the problem and it just hurt too much to wear them for any extended period of time (an hour was about my limit). I do have small ears, so this is probably where the problem came from, but I tried the earbuds without the pieces that cover where the sound comes out (not sure what else to call it) and they were still too long.I get why they are priced so high, I do. I'm just disappointed that I spent that much money on something that ultimately didn't work.

When I temporarily misplaced them I decided to pull the trigger on the new Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II. When I first got them I was stunned! The sound quality was amazing, surpassing the already incredible first generation. The resolution was so good I was picking up nuances of sound never heard before in songs I had listened to for many years. The noise cancelling was even better than the first generation. The bass left me wondering how there could be so much impact happening inside my ear. Sound quality was 6 out of 5 stars.But then I noticed a firmware update in the Bose app. I foolishly thought that what was perfect could become even better. Wow, was I wrong. Shortly after the update, I noticed some random anomalies. For a split second, the sound would warp, almost as if the sync between the two buds skewed between stereo and mono. At first I thought it was just a random glitch in the source material but this proved not to be the case. The issue became more frequent and proved consistent on other devices with multiple sources. I officially had a defective product.Bose support was quick to exchange the earbuds for a new pair. They sent me a shipping label and were quick to ship on their end once they received my old set. I did not realize at the time that the new firmware was the issue. So when I got the new pair, guess what I did? Yep, updated the firmware right out of the box. Predictably, the same issue occurred with the new set. At this point I did what I should have the first time around and researched the issue online. It did not take long to find that many others were having the same problem since the update.The second call to Bose went similar to the first with a quick resolution to replace the headphones. I am now waiting for the new ones and hope they have an older firmware version on them. Unfortunately the Bose rep was not able to do anything but follow their script and had no information about if they were working on a fix for the firmware. i'm sure this is a known issue and hope that they address it soon.If Bose fixes their glitchy firmware then I will update this review and the buds will score a solid 5 stars.",True,Color: Triple BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds II,[],5.0,B0B4PSQHD5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B4PSQHD5?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B4PSQHD5&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,834.0,491.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 182.19, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 279, 'currency': '$'}}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2

Since the Soundsport are losing battery life..usually over 3 hours...now it has been limited to 1 1/2 hrs. When I inserted these in and play my typical tunes..boy was I let down. The sound is clear and crisp. But there is barely any bass...the very touch sensitivity of the earbuds are annoying as well. Each time I just barely touch it...it stops the music or changes the song. I cranked it to the max and still barely get the bump vs when I use the Soundsports..I will just have to return it.If you want just quality sounding earbuds...this may be it.

I have the previous models which I really loved but I figured with a new model it must be better in every way. When I first got them, that seemed to be the case. the noise canceling was definitely an improvement. The audio quality was also improved. The comfort was good but not great. However, as time went on, I find that this new fit system just doesn’t work for me in my right ear. I’ve switched back-and-forth between all the sizes of the earplug and wing but overtime the right one just finds its way out of my ear and will literally fall out of my head. for an expensive pair of earbuds, This can be kind of annoying. No … very annoying. I really think Bose should’ve stuck with the previous fit system and improved upon it as opposed to going back to a more traditional wing system. The old system, while not perfect was very comfortable and never fell out of my head. So it’s truly unfortunate that this new model is better in someways and worse in others. Another issue is there is also synchronicity issues for the first few minutes after you put them on. The older model did not have this problem at all.  I suspect this is because Bose caved under pressure to get independent channels to each ear and this causes some issues because this wasn’t happening until they updated the buds to support independent listening with either bud. As time goes by these are getting progressively worse and I should’ve just stuck with the previous model , which makes the previous model a great deal to buy. If you just want a really good pair of noise canceling earbuds, the noise canceling isn’t quite as good as this model but it’s more than adequate so I would say, save yourself some money and buy the previous model. I hope Bose goes back to the previous design and makes it a bit lighter and more compact instead of going with this new model wing system because it’s just not as good as the old one. It’s also more complicated and harder to get a good fit. Given the higher price and a step back on quality, I I am doing a pretty low score, but this is because the previous model is better and this one was more expensive so comparatively the previous mall gets five stars but this one gets three.P.S.

4.0,Connection issues made me have to return,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D4Y034W022KB?ASIN=B0B4PSQHD5,"1,068 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2023",2023-04-26,United States,,"Man, I thought I'd found the perfect earbuds and am so bummed I have to return these.  A little background:  I've been using v1 of the Airpods Pro for about 2.5 years.  One of them flaked out last week so I began searching for a replacement.  While I'm well within the Apple universe (MacBook Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, iPad Pro, etc) I also use Windows quite a bit.  In my search I read dozens of reviews on earbuds, and the vast majority of them almost presumptively point Apple users to the Airpods Pro 2.  I get it, in theory everything syncs up and works better.  But there were things I didn't like about the Airpods Pro 1 (ANC was mediocre, and particularly bad on a plane; sound quality was meh).  So I was actually eager to step outside the Apple box and try something a little more universal.  I narrowed my search down to two, and ended up purchasing both the Bose QC II as well as the Airpods Pro 2, with the intent of doing my own use case testing and returning one.Upon receiving and trying both, it took me less than 30 minutes to decide which to keep:  The Bose QC II.The ANC on the Airpods 2 was very, very good, but the Bose QC II just took it a couple notches better.  As I travel on airplanes quite a bit the ANC was very important to me, and like I said my experience with the original Airpods was lacking.Additionally, after playing a few of my favorite songs with each unit, the Airpods Pro 2 sounded good, but the Bose QC II again came out on top.  I'm not an audiophile, but the sound was just richer, with more depth; I heard certain notes in a different way than I ever had with the Airpods.It was at this point that I decided to send the Airpods back, which I did the following day, ready to begin my new and better audio life with the Bose QC II.  Everything started out in a state of bliss.  Working out of a home office, I could no longer hear my wife working through her accounting problems via Zoom calls in the other room. (FWIW, I also didn't hear her when she came up behind me and asked if I wanted something for lunch).  I received a call, and though I fumbled a bit with the controls the first time the call quality was fine, and they seemed to be able to hear me OK.However, the first chink in the armor came just this evening when I tried connecting the Bose QC II to my Windows system in preparation for a call I have tomorrow.  Connection via Bluetooth was simple and straightforward.  I then went to a news site that I knew had videos and listened.  For some reason the sound kept clicking in and out.  I thought it might be the connection with the site, so opened Spotify and played a couple of songs.  Same issue.  I then went to the Bose app on my iPhone, which said it was having trouble connecting, even though it was in fact connected to the PC (albeit a little glitchy).At the end of the day, this last experience seems consistent with so many of the other reviews that I read up here (thank you), and I just don't want to be dealing with this again and again (and especially not after I'm past the return window!).  I have no interest in going through a tech support call with Bose or them sending a new pair.  For $300 plus tax I shouldn't have to, and these should work more seamlessly.  So I'm returning, and I'm not sure what I'm going to replace them with.A few other observations:- The controls for pausing, skipping forward, moving back, volume control, etc. work and are intuitive, however a few times I inadvertently paused music when I was just trying to adjust the earpod.  This wasn't the deal killer; I figured in time I'd get used to the sensitivity and figure it out.  But it was a little annoying and perhaps some sensitivity adjustments, or more of a haptic-type feel would work better.- The earbuds themselves fit great out of the box.  I didn't even try the other sizes.  They were very comfortable.- I liked how each time I put the earpods in it told me how much battery was left in each.- The charging case is slightly larger than the Airpods case, but still very pocketable.  I could care less that it doesn't support wireless charging, just not a big deal to me.  The magnet holding the earpods in also seemed a little stronger than Apple's case, which I really liked because anytime I accidentally dropped the Apple case the earpods would fall out and slide all over the place (wood floors).In summary, again I really, really wanted these to work out.  I was so impressed with the ANC and sound quality, and liked how the bass and treble could be adjusted in the Bose app.  It's just a shame that it had these connection glitches with my computer system.  To be clear, I've read that Bose customer support is  good and fair, but again if I have to call customer support to just to properly use a pair of $300 earbuds then something is wrong.UPDATE:So before returning I decided to try one more time with connecting to computer.  I shut down all devices (iPad, etc) that were near the computer, to reduce any potential interference.  This resolved the issue with the sound breaking out and the earbuds worked fine.I then shut down the computer and reconnected them to the iPhone. All good. However, when I rebooted the computer I somehow lost the connection with the iPhone, and what I was listening to stopped playing.  I then looked at the Bose app and it was somewhere in no man’s land, searching for a connection with the earbuds.  Only a reboot of the phone got the app out of this mode, and allowed me to reconnect.So… this takes me back to my original point:  These are among THE MOST EXPENSIVE earbuds on the market right now.  I’m the consumer and it’s not my job, nor interest, to troubleshoot problems and jump through hoops to figure out what’s going on.  That should have happened at in the Bose QC department, but from my brief experience combined with all the reviews I’ve read, it seems like something slipped past them.Thank you and God bless.",True,Color: Triple BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds II,[],1.0,B0B4PSQHD5,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B4PSQHD5?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B4PSQHD5&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,1133.0,400.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 182.19, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 279, 'currency': '$'}}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2
4.0,Compare against Beats Pro...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SL5Q8UQ7OF3S?ASIN=B0B4PSQHD5,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2023",2023-12-03,United States,,"So I have been torn what to buy and have been reading and reading reviews for weeks now. I finally decided it down to these and Beats Fit Pro. I really like these and honestly between the two you really can't tell much difference. The noise cancelation is a tiny bit better in the Bose, but the sound and bass response is better in the Beats. It honestly came down to one deciding factor,  the button to change songs and control the ear buds. On the Beats you actually have a bottom you can feel that clicks instead of the Bose where you just touch the outside. Obviously with the Beats,  it's very responsive with the button feel,  the Bose were actually more difficult to control. Sometimes when you pressed it twice to change the song it would put it on pause,  and pressing it three times would only change the song to the next track instead of repeating or taking you back a track. The Beats seem to fit a bit better than the Bose as well. Also, the Beats were $50 cheaper, honestly not a deal breaker either way, but it was added to the pros when I started adding everything up against the two. Overall my choice after about a week of comparing the two were the Beats. I actually really wanted to like the Bose more,  because I have grown up with Bose and always had their products,  but at the end of the day Beats came out on top.

The wired version uses stability bands that extrude from the earbuds, keeping them more securely in place, and the ear tip material is a little stiffer which, for me, works better.This all apparently differs between individuals, so they may work well for you, as they seem to have done for  others. It's just the comparison falls a bit short for me. The charging case is nice, battery life is okay for me, and the quality overall seems excellent.

These earbuds work as they should they cancel a lot of outside noise while still allowing you to speak and hear within an acceptable range. That is life-changing for me.The app is frustrating to use so far. These things demand to be paired even though they don't need to be paired to anything in order to work with the sound canceling. So I have to pair them to the app and then mute the app in order to use them like they would if no app existed. And it's not even the app that the earbuds themselves demand to be paired to a device. I don't want that but I haven't yet found a work around. Because if I don't have Wi-Fi or I'm not in an area where they can be paired then they just constantly bark to be paired. It's very unnecessary and very annoying. It's possible that I will find Solutions as these are quite new to me.I don't know what the sound quality is like in frankly I don't care.

SUCKS.With Airpods and Galaxy Buds the case is magnetic, it's so satisfying to open and close you find yourself doing it just to do it. The Bose case on the other hand is not magnetic but has a latch, a FLIMSY latch. The case feels like something you'd buy from the fleamarket, opening it is a pain as you have to really push the button in, even having to use my fingernails sometimes to press it all the way. It has no weight to it, it squeaks when you press on it like it's going to shatter. It is big yes, but I don't really mind the size, I mind its quality and design.. AWFUL case.The buds themselves are counterintuitive!!!!! In this day and age how could a company not only known for making audio products but being THE audio company make wireless earbuds that still require you to constantly take your phone out to navigate?!Galaxy Buds havea one press to play, 2 press to skip forward, and 3 press to skip backwards, with an app to change what a long press can do  Great, I don't need to take my phone out to change music.And if I want to listen to just the left bud (I'm in security so I have a 2-wire in the right ear) no problem I can listen with just the left, the single, double, and long presses will still work on just the oneBose on the other hand... double press to play on the RIGHT bud, long press on the RIGHT bud to activate voice assistant without the option of changing that (because I really need voice assistant right?)The Left bud has double press to change noise cancellation levels based on 3 settings you've set up (WHY? If anything it should be double press to alternate between full noise cancellation and zero nose cancellation) So if someone is talking to me I now have to keep double pressing the left bud till 0% noise cancellation pops up then keep at it again to go back to full ANC..... I look like an idiot doing this so I just take the buds out of my earsThe LEFT bud has a long press to skip forward, which you can change to instead tell you the battery level.......

Rip me I guess, and if you're just listening to the right, well remember only the left can skip music so out comes the phone againThe eartip wings also hurt and get itchy, I've even gotten a scab from wearing these, and yes I've tried all sizes.IT BLOWS MY MIND a company that's a titan in the audio industry releases a near $300 earbud but decides to go with version 1.0 when the competition is on version 20, you should be improving upon your competitor's designs to make it the most intuitive earbud yet instead you're going backwards.If this was the first wireless earbud ever released all that^ would make sense, but it's not, so it doesn't.

I am comparing these to my Apple AirPods Pro which is probably the biggest competitor in this segment and the Bose QC Earbuds are worse in almost every category while being $60 more expensive.The ANC is very good, but for $279 earbuds I also expect the best possible experience in usability, material quality and connectivity. And that's where they aren't any better than a cheap $40 pair of earbuds.The negative:- The charging case is clunky and the plastic inside feels cheap. The mechanical opening mechanism also feels cheap and it's difficult to open the case with one hand without lifting it up. Bose, for that price why didn't you go for a magnetic opening mechanism?- The Bluetooth range is pretty mediocre, it usually loses the signal in the next room already. As a comparison, my AirPods usually stay connected in the entire house.- The controls work but tapping the earbuds is uncomfortable in your ear. Imagine slapping on your ear with your flat hand, that's how it feels.- Transparency mode is okay but it's not as clear as the AirPods, and there's a constant white noise in the background.- Why can't I change the amount of ANC modes (""Favorites"")? You're stuck with 3 modes even though I only want to switch between full transparency and full ANC. There's always one mode in between so I need to tap 4 times to get full ANC.- It only connects to one device at a time. And switching devices is bothersome. (see next point)- What's the point of the ""Source"" view in the app? In order to connect to other devices I need to disconnect it from my phone, so the app loses connection, too, which makes the entire view obsolete.- The ""eartip wings"" are different from previous products (eg. the SoundTrue earbuds), and they don't fit as well anymore. It depends on your ear shape of course, but my old SoundTrue earbuds are muuuch more comfortable and stable.- The initial ""Connected to ..."" voice every time you put the earbuds in is obnoxious. If your device name is long (and you can't change it because it's a work computer!) it'll take like 5-10 seconds every time until you can hear things because the robot voice wants to read your full device name first.The positive:- Sound is ok. Not as clear as the AirPods Pro but okay. It's a bit more bass heavy than previous Bose products which I like.- ANC is very very good, better than the AirPods Pro.- Even though the earbuds are a bit chunkier they're still light and look pretty decent.Overall in my opinion these earbuds should be priced around $150 to $199 max.

My ears are slightly different, but i've never had to do this before. Not necessarily a negative.-The charging case is huge. I'm mixed because I destroyed my galaxy buds by accidentally washing them inside their charging case in my gym shorts pocket. There's no way i'm accidentally missing this giant case, but it is a little unwieldly.-The charging case opens with an awkward push button instead of magnets. I could potentially get used to it over time, but this push button felt really awkward and took multiple tries to open every time. However, on my old bluetooth ear buds the charging case magnetically closed. On the occasion i've accidentally dropped that case, as soon as it hits the ground the case would pop open and send both ear buds literally flying out of the case. The button on these prevents that.Con:-Would no longer connect to bluetooth after the 1st day. The buds both showed red/white alternating flashing lights that multiple answers on Google say is a firmware error. Could potentially fix it with a couple hours of troubleshooting, but it's not my job to fix Bose's lemons. It also doesn't make me feel confident in a $300 investment.-Could not connect to bluetooth without the buds being in the case even after they were paired. My current cheap $40 ear buds will pair automatically with my phone on opening the case and being put in my ears. Allegedly a phone app could remedy this, but that just seems like extra steps that none of my previous bluetooth earbuds needed.-One ear bud never seemed to sit quite right and physically felt odd. My two ears are slightly different, but i've never had an issue like that. Maybe i'd get used to it over time.-These protrude quite a bit from your ears. I like to listen to soundscapes while I fall asleep and specifically wanted these because my over-the-head earphones are somewhat uncomfortable for side sleepers. These were actually worse to side sleep with because of how much they protrude from your ear.Altogether I was disappointed. My Bose over-the-head earphones are great. These ear buds were a dud.

2.0,Consistent problems connecting via Bluetooth,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT8WM0GQ5JBVH?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023",2023-02-22,United States,,"I have had these phones for a few months and the one thing I noticed with them is that there is consistent problems connecting to my phone via Bluetooth. I would say they connect to my phone and work properly on the first attempt about 20% of the times I use them. Unacceptable!I open the case, wait for the blue lights to flash, then insert them into the ears. I hear the ""Battery 100%, connected to iPhone"", but then that's it. Once I attempt to play music, nothing. It doesn't matter the music app (Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, etc.), the app shows the music playing, but I don't hear anything. Volume is up and everything. The workaround is to put them back into the case, close the case, wait about 10 seconds, open up the case again, wait for the blue lights, insert them into ears. Usually the 2nd time works, but seriously, for the amount of money for these things, they should work PERFECTLY EVERY TIME!! Bose are supposed to be some the best audio products out there, but these buds are a complete letdown.None of the other features mean a thing (battery life, sound cancelling, etc.) if the buds don't ACTUALLY PLAY MUSIC! I have had no problems with battery life or sound cancelling when they do work. They sound great and are very comfortable in the ears. I don't really understand the point of the Bose app as it doesn't really offer anything worth opening a separate app for.When they work, they're great.

When I would insert both headphones into my ears I could only hear audio out of my right ear bud.

I never do.  I wanted to give 3 at least, because the audio quality is good.  I'm only not giving it a one-star for that.  If they don't refund me, I will move this to a 1 star.I've had these phones for a couple months.  Before I get to my main gripe, I will quickly mention that people can't hear me anymore on bluetooth calls, and I'm getting a LOT of static all of the sudden (not bluetooth related, disconnect and it's still there).Here's the problem with these headphones.  The touch controls.  There are no buttons, and the touch controls are very sensitive.  So if you are a guy with medium length hair like me, who works out very hard and sweats A LOT, either the hair bouncing on the right earbud or the sweat causes it to constantly activate Siri on your iPhone, or pause the music.  The left earbud has a shortcut function that can be turned off, so that helps (because otherwise the left touch control would activate constantly as well).  I was hoping after a few firmware updates, they would have given the option to turn off touch functionality on the right earbud -- after all, these are designed for fitness, and I can't be the only one out there with medium length hair that sweats a lot.  And for the price of these headphones.... the fact that they haven't addressed this is really sad.If you don't sweat a lot, or just don't really work out that hard, then you may find that these earbuds work well for you.  But I had to go back to my Jaybird Vistas because they had a button and wouldn't constantly shut off the music once i get halfway through an intense metabolic conditioning workout or 15 minutes of running.I have a workout Instagram account, @lift.hacks, that I was posting workouts to during quarantine that you can check out to see if this will apply to you.

2.0,Not usual Bose quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29DH1KCQLDM6L?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2022",2022-06-29,United States,,"I confidently ordered these bluetooth noise cancelling earbuds because I had purchased Bose products before and was very satisfied. Now I have to rethink that confidence. I ordered them in Dec 2021 because I knew I had travel coming up this year; however, because of a variety of circumstances, I wasn't able to actually get them set up for use until May 2022. I've had nothing but trouble with them ever since. The bluetooth only intermittently connects with my phones. I do not have this problem with other bluetooth devices. Once I got them fully charged and working for a four hour flight, they crapped out after about 3 hours. Not enough service for the international flights I take, so I purchased a cheaper set of bluetooth earbuds as backup (though they are not noise cancelling). I brought the Bose earbuds on a recent flight, thinking I had solved the problems. They seemed to work okay on the transAtlantic flight going, but while in Europe the right side earbud stopped charging. So now they don't work at all. I looked for help online and found the videos on Amazon. But the videos are video only, no audio, so they are difficult/impossible to understand clearly and the earbuds featured in them are different from the model I have, so I'm not confident in their advice anyway. I also went to the Bose website, and still didn't find the help I needed. My only choice may be to call their help line and waste a bunch more time on a product that could have worked from the beginning. And that I've only had the chance to use twice.I spent $200 thinking I would get Bose quality (and now I see the price is $250 today!), but I am very unhappy with these.

3.0,Way better than the AirPods Pro???,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y223Z7IOZQG8?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,"2,531 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2020",2020-10-14,United States,,"[Update 12/3] - They just added volume controls which is a really big deal. I'm leaving at 3 stars until they can add multi-point and because I discovered a super annoying ""feature"" that perhaps is only a problem with my pair. I've added it to my list of cons - Transparency Mode/ANC Level 0, Ouch my Ears!Disclosure: This review comes from someone that mainly listens to Hip Hop, Metal, Dubstep, or Reggaetón. So my standard for audio may differ from others.Also I will be comparing these to 4 other in-ear headphones.1. Bose SoundSport Wired In-Ear Headphones (Pictured far left)2. Google Pixel Buds (Pictured second from the left)3. Bose SoundSport Wireless (Pictured second from the right)4. AirPods Pro (not pictured)Let me start by saying that I want to give these a higher rating but 3 stars is how I honestly feel based on how they are priced and the gripes I have with them. My standards may be too high.PROS• Comfort. Just what you would expect from Bose. The new ear tips make them more comfortable than the  SoundSport Wireless and just as comfortable as the SoundSport Wired. They are also very secure and not as heavy as I was expecting despite their size.• ANC. The Noise Cancelling is top notch! Arguably better than AirPods Pro. The transparency mode/passthrough is also great when ANC is set to 0. But I would argue that it sounds a bit more natural on the Air Pods Pro. THIS IS WHAT YOU’RE PAYING FOR, and it’s almost worth it.• Sound. For me, the sound is far superior to the Air Pods Pro. They have way better bass and the sound signature is exactly what I’ve come to expect from Bose. They sound way better than Bose SoundSport Wireless and are on par if not better than SoundSport Wired. It really depends on the device you are connected to though. For some reason the buds sound way better (louder) on my Pixel 4a than my iPhone Xr. I’m not 100% sure why but my guess would be that the iPhone Xr only supports Bluetooth 5.0.• Charging. Qi Wireless and USBC charging make these feel modern and extremely convenient. Making them on par to the Pixel Buds and AirPods Pro• Touch controls. Really nice to have feature and I am glad its there. But the execution is lacking compared to Pixel Buds. So much so, it's almost a con. [Update] 12/3. These now have volume control straight from the Ear Buds!CONS• The case. It’s unreasonably large and only offers 12 additional hours of charge. Compared to the Pixel Buds and AirPods Pro, which offer a significantly smaller case and longer charge times, this is a bit embarrassing for Bose to not offer something competitive in this area for the price point. I also prefer a magnetic lid vs a push button.• Independent use/functionality. I can confirm that you can use either bud independently. But you lose functionality depending on which one you are using. The touch controls are almost on par to the Airpods Pro, with one exception, you can’t go back a track. However, the Bose QC earbuds really start to show their poor execution when you use the buds individually. If you take one of the earbuds out, the music will stop as anticipated. When you place the removed earbud in the case, the bud still on ear will make a sound like it’s powered off; however, when you play your media on your device, the sound will come through the earbud still in your ear, even if the other bud is in the case. This sounds cool and all until you realize that certain touch controls are assigned to only one bud or the other. Only using the left bud causes you to lose the ability to answer calls, play/pause music through touch controls because those features are assigned to the right bud only. Only using the right ear causes you to lose the ability to forward a song/hear battery level or toggle between 3 customizable ANC settings because those features are assigned to the left bud only. The Pixel Buds have the best touch controls by far, which allow you to use basically all the same controls on either bud, and allows you to lower and increase volume while the Bose QC earbuds do not. With that said, you can still accomplish all of the above through the Bose Music App. [Update] everything I've said about this is still true but I left out one major limitation. The mic only works on the right earbud, making the left bud unusable on its own for phone calls. Which may be why you can only invoke the voice assistant with the right bud. Not a huge gripe for me, but I've seen a lot of contradicting statements on this functionality and wanted to provide as much detail as I could come up with.• Multipoint. This by far is my biggest gripe. This is such a great feature present in the Bose SoundSport Wireless, but the feature is sadly missing on the QC Earbuds. The feature allows you to seamlessly switch between two devices, and even toggle up to 7 devices right from the device. The new app required to use the QC Earbuds also doesn’t really make it easy to switch devices on the fly. This makes switching between devices feel cumbersome and not modern at all. Especially considering that Apple just added similar functionality to the AirPods Pro (only supported with other apple products).• Find my buds. Also missing here. I was really hoping these had this feature as I anticipate misplacing them often. Feature present in older Bose earbuds, Pixel Buds, and AirPod Pros.• Price. The pricepoint is way too high considering how much the AirPod Pros do better than the QC Earbuds. In a battle of Sound and ANC, Bose takes the clear win. But when it comes down to features/functionality, AirPods Pro is the clear winner for me.• [Update 12/3] Transparency Mode/ANC Level 0, Ouch my Ears! . I've discovered that some sounds are amplified through the earbuds when using them with Noise Cancelling set to 0. The setting is supposed to allow you to hear your surroundings which works fine. But if you leave them in your ear to and are not listening to music or on a call, some sounds are way too loud and kinda hurt my ear. 😢 (Examples. Shutting a car door, clinking sounds, or glass breaking). Basically I cannot leave them in my ear when not in use because I'm afraid one day some unknown sound will cause damage to my ear. This is very inconvenient, especially because carrying the case around is also inconvenient due to its size. So I basically only use them exclusively around my house when consuming media. I then immediately take them off. I honestly feel like taking another star off because of this.Conclusion: The perfect earbuds don’t exist. These almost checked all my boxes. I love the buds for their comfort, amazing sound, and superior ANC. I really like how they look despite their larger size. But for the price I expect to have all the features, with no compromises. I don’t really understand why Bose would release these with the present limitations and lack of features from previous devices. With all of that said, I would still rate these above the other earbuds solely based on Sound and ANC.My ratings based on these factors: Age, Form Factor, Sound, Price, Functionality1. Bose SoundSport Wired In-Ear Headphones (Pictured far left) – 5 Stars (not comparable), perfect wired in-ear headphones at the time with great sound and comfort. Worth every penny if you can find them at the original price.2. Google Pixel Buds (Pictured second from the left) – 2 Stars (somewhat comparable), Best touch controls by far, but they really hurt my ears, and the sound is just okay. Totally overpriced at $180.3. Bose SoundSport Wireless (Pictured second from the right) – 2 stars (not comparable), I loved having them around my neck at all times and the Multipoint feature is awesome. But the build quality was terrible, and the sound was okay. Pricing wasn’t terrible for what they offered, but the build quality makes them hard to recommend.4. AirPods Pro (not pictured) – 3 stars (Most Comparable), AirPods Pro are jam-packed with amazing features in such a tiny form factor. They truly are kind of magical. But for me the sound quality was not worth the price tag ($220).5. Bose QuietComfort Earbuds – 3 stars, amazing sound and ANC, but lacks in the features department quite considerably. I think pricing them at $220 would have easily bumped these up to 4 stars for me and would make them extremely competitive against the AirPods Pro. At that pricepoint I would gladly trad off features for better sound and ANC. If Bose is somehow able to patch in some of the missing features through software updates I will update my rating. But I'm thinking it may comedown to hardware limitations. So for now, it's 3 stars and I'm still on the hunt for the perfect earbuds. :(",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719n57ih7SL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C8QRYLlbL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tKhgRuNaL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sNhMEkWPL._SY88.jpg']",1.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1940.0,853.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds
3.0,RAISED FROM 2 STARS TO 3 WITH APP UPDATES: multi device abscence and ear comfort still an issue,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R186QXSKG2RJC8?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,27 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020",2020-10-16,United States,,"Raised from 2 stars to 3 (12/4). Volume control now on-bud!Some increased usability through firmware and App updates. Still has flaws.CONSUNSTABLE BLUETOOTH: Bluetooth connectivity drops out, switches devices oddly or drops off one ear while you are using them. Using them with a computer (on MS Teams) gives a ton of background noise and feedback, so you can't use them on a ""Teams"" call. Note that connecting to the Bose UC USB adapter cleans this noise. NOTE THIS HAS IMPROVED WITH UPDATES. STILL NOT THE BEST OF BREED.WON'T CONNECT TO ITS ANDROID APP: Bose Music application worked for a few days. But now refuses to connect to the earbuds. it can find them, it just won't connect and allow you to change any settings. (App is terrible anyway...with almost no functionality other than volume and Noise Reduction settings). NOTE THIS IS NOW MUCH MORE STABLE AFTER A FEW APP UPDATES.NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS OLDER BOSE BUDS: While the original QC earbuds (corded) were super comfortable in the ear, these have an additional hump (part of the hard plastic) that makes them uncomfortable after about 1hr. This did not happen with prior QC buds i have owned. Also, the silicone is harder than the clear silicone they used to use (used to be a 2-part supersoft / slightly stiffer combination material for the comfort-tips)...now it is all the harder silicone, which is just not as comfortable. The old QC buds...I could wear for an entire day without discomfort (except sweat...which is unavoidable). These cause some physical PAIN. NO CHANGE IN MY OPINION... THESE ARE GOOD FOR 2HRS BEFORE MY EARS HURT AND I HAVE TO SWITCH HEADPHONES.Pretty much only tolerate these things for this price. I have probably 20 sets of earphones. I love buying and testing them. These are probably worth $199-$225 with the list of flaws. Not nearly $300. Only thing that sets them apart from Sony are the comfort-tips....but they made these less comfortable too with the new plastic hump that sits on your ear cartridge next to your skull.CASE IS VERY LARGE AND NOT POCKETABLE: The case is extremely thick. You will not want to put this in any pants pockets. Only a jacket or a backpack or purse. They should have made this wider and thinner. Not a big deal for me as I mostly use in travel with a backpack.BATTERY LIFE NOT GREAT: I get 3 to 4 hours before the notifications begin. This is not the headset for international air travel or even long domestic flights. Plus, just not comfortable enough for that anyway. Yes, you can case charge them, but on an airplane, you're stuck with no hearing protection for 15 minutes. Wish I could get 6 hours at least.(Fixed WITH 12/3 APP UPDATE) NO VOLUME CONTROL ON BUDS: FIXED... BUT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RELEASED BEFORE THIS WAS READY... SHAME ON YOU BOSE. No volume control on buds. You can pull a bud out to pause. But if you want to raise or lower volume of a call or music, you have to go to your phone or laptop. This is not only dangerous for hearing, it is a massive oversight. Sony had the same issue in their higher end buds and eventually released a firmware update. Bose needs to add volume to the Favorite settings.NO EQUALIZER ANYWHERE: These don't work with the Bose Connect app... Only the Bose Music app. This has no equalizer. Hope you like lots of bass. If you are used to slightly overdriven Bose low and and highs.... You'll be fine. They do sound great, but wish I could flatten the EQ CURVE. And for comparison... These have probably 30%-50% more bass than the 700s. I wish the 700s had a bit more bass and the Buds had a bit less. But I prefer the sound of the Buds to the 700s either way.SINGLE DEVICE CONNECTION, NO SWITCHING: Only one device connected at a time! So if you use a computer and your phone, you have to disconnect first from one, then connect to the other. It is really PAINFUL PROCESS. THIS STILL IRKS ME. I USE MY 700 HEADPHONES INSTEAD OF BUDS FOR THIS REASON. HATE SWITCHING DEVICES.... AND YOU HAVE TO TURN OFF YOUR PHONE BLUETOOTH TO SWITCH. REALLY REALLY ANNOYING!!PROSSOUND: I prefer these to 700 bose headphones for music. Have more bass and just a crisper sound you get with buds vs over ears. 700 wins hands down on conference calls though.LOOKS: on video calls, these are much less intrusive looking than a giant over ear headset like the 700. While the 700 sounds better for calls, I sometimes prefer the small profile of the buds to appear more professional and less like a DJ.PORTABILITY: while the case is huge, this is easier to travel with than the 700s or QCs.COMFORT TIPS: bose corners the market on this style of tip. Yes it goes in the ear, but it doesn't create a sweaty vacuum seal like others. This means less booming noises when you walk or move around. Still the best in the market. I still hate the new hard plastic hump that hurts my ear, though. Original QC buds didn't have that painful thing.

3.0,Could be better,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZF366QO242J9?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021",2021-03-16,United States,,"I purchased these wildly expensive headphones to help actually hear things I was going to be listening to anyway in my extremely loud work environment. Admittedly, I might be in circumstances that are a little harsher than most users of these headphones, but for the price tag, I kind of expected these to be a little better than what they actually are. First off, the charging case is way more fragile than I ever thought it would've been. It fell out of my pocket not even two weeks into owning my pair and the internal mechanism that keeps it shut snapped and the case no longer stays closed on its own. I've taken to wrapping a rubber band around it to solve the issue, and that isn't enough to make me not want to use these, but it is kind of strange that something at this price point could take such a fall from such a low height and break like that. After a solid three months of use, the battery charge indicator lights on the outside of the case have also started to become inaccurate and aren't reliable. It already requires me to put it on charge again more than any other rechargeable product I've ever purchased, save for perhaps my 10 year old laptop. And it's only been *three* months.The earphones have odd connection problems sometimes that I have a hard time figuring out. Sometimes only one earphone will work, or one earphone's noise cancelling will work but the other won't, or sometimes they will say they're connected to my phone, my phone will say it is connected to them, but no audio will come out. A quick tuck back into their case (closed and rubber banded shut) for a few minutes usually fixes it, thankfully, but it's still a rather annoying issue to come across every couple of days or so. Sometimes the magnets that keep the earphones charging will slide just ever so barely slightly out of position and the earphones will not recharge, frustrating me during a very long day at work. Then there's the issue of battery life: I'm lucky if these get me to 6 hours. With other competitors on the market pushing 8 hours, I gotta say I'm not impressed.The touch controls are a little wonky sometimes. Lately, it seems that they've become less and less responsive. I have to double tap two or three times to get the noise canceling mode to change or to pause, and it often completely misreads my taps to pause as an attempt to change the volume. This becomes perhaps the most irritating issue of all when something happens that requires me to turn the noise cancelling down/off and pause my music quickly. The worst though (and to be fair, it happens with other bluetooth headphones too, not just the Bose) is when it misinterprets a volume press as a voice assistant press, who then interprets the background noise around me as a request and decides to call someone at random from my contacts list. That's lead to some awkward situations.In terms of fit and comfort, that too is inconsistent. Some days they'll fit perfectly and I won't even be able to tell I have them on, other days (MOST days, to be honest) they'll start hurting four hours in, and other days still they fall out of my ears. They especially seem prone to falling out when I'm on the phone with others and they've got me smiling or laughing. The headphones come with three different sized caps to accommodate for different ear sizes, as is pretty standard for most earphones, but none of them seem to fit my ears particularly well. I must have the most strange ear canals in the world...The real secret main reason I bought these, finally, was for making calls in those loud environments, and, well... meh. Even when I'm in quieter environments my conversational partners seem to find it hard to hear me and that's a bummer. At this price point, you should be able to hear my guts moving my food around as I talk! Disappointing.All that being said, though, these aren't bad headphones. They do what I need them to do, for the most part. They make the horribly loud noises I'm surrounded by all day long tolerably soft. Sometimes I wear them not even to listen to music or talk to others, but just to have some layer of noise dampening so I feel a little less like I'm going deaf. When I do listen to music, it sounds crisp and clear (maybe a *little* less bass-y than I prefer, but we can't have everything!) and it's much easier to hear the people I'm talking to on calls. I don't strictly speaking regret buying them, but I do wish they were a little cheaper, or that some of these issues were ironed out a little better at the price point they're at.",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],3.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1940.0,853.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds
3.0,These are honestly the best sounding ear buds I have ever used when it comes to sound performance.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34WZMR7HPBC3Z?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,12 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2022",2022-10-02,United States,,"These buds cancel ANY+ALL noises out, 100%. They sound AH-MAZING! Super comfy! Despite the way they “look like they would feel” in your ears. Especially compared in size to 🍎 and Beats Buds. If you are not worried about the seamless connection ((such as connecting automatically, or reconnecting automatically after you walk out of range from your device while using the buds, as well as having to try several times to connect them through either the device’s Bluetooth settings, or if you are forced to connect them through the Bose app, this gets very frustrating because Bose has a total of THREE APPS. It doesn’t say which of those is ACTUALLY the preferred and up to date app. But I believe ATLEAST two of the apps recommend you downloading the newer version. And it doesn’t state which is preferred. So when you are forced to connect through Bose app because of connectivity failure, you feel unsure if you are in the correct app so you attempt several times in each app)) By that time, you are pissed off and DETERMINED to MAKE them connect someway. So it turns to a vicious cycle. Then once connected… God forbid you forget about the hell you went through to successfully connect them and run out in a desperate attempt to NOT pee your pants and step out of range! Because they are not going to give you that once annoying— but NOW HEAVENLY reconnect sound that AirPods give you after returning back to range letting you know that they have reconnected AUTOMATICALLY to your device!  That noise used to irritate me when I had AirPods. I found myself yearning for that sound to fill my ears after ditching all 5 pairs of AirPods to family members and friends that mentioned they wanted some AirPods or needed AirPods. (Part of me just wanted to break all of the “Indian giving” rules that my Mama taught me not to ever do. 🥴🥴Another great thing about the Bose QuietComfort ear buds is that the charging case is substantially larger in size. Most probably wouldn’t prefer the charging case to be any bigger than Apple Airpod cases. But I was FOREVER losing my AirPods. And forever having the hardest time locations and actually finding them. But I have had the Bose for TWO MONTHS. You would not believe that my B-U-double-T never misplaced them, never lost them, never had to search for them. NOT ONE SINGLE TIME. I believe that the size of the earbuds them self had much to do with not losing the individual earbuds— and the charging case being 3X’s the size of any AirPods.If  you could careless about that seamlessness connection between Apple products or Apple and newer Beats, then these ARE amazing. They sound great. You can not even feel them in your ears after the first hour or two. They just suck you right into the music because the noise cancellation is so powerful … your request is Bose’s demand. They are pretty amazing when it comes to those things. It’s the  mood for me, that I get in after spending an unsuccessful 30 minutes trying to connect some buds that decide that they are going to make me out to be a liar. Then suddenly, later on connecting MAYBE once with no issues. When you are not in a hurry or need them intensely. When you are laying around or going to sleep… they don’t give you an issue. It happened to me only when I needed them most. That’s how it ALL is though, AMM-I right?This may not be the case when you have an Android or Samsung or LG or Google phone. But it is definately a very well known issue with Apple devices. It just got extremely old. Extremely quick. So..

The product photos are either photo-shopped to make them look smaller, or they intentionally found models with gigantic heads. These earbuds are enormous and heavy. No joke.Sound:The sound is fantastic. If you are an ""audiophile"" (AKA super, duper nit-picky about sound profiles far, far past the point that it actually matters in any way), you might find some faults here. They sound great. End of story.Active Noise Cancelling (ANC):Fantastic.I haven't tried all the earbuds out there. Trying these alongside my Airpods Pro, the Bose cancel far, FAR more noise. I work next to a loud air conditioner. Although I can still hear it running 5 ft away. I can only BARELY hear it. ANC is great!Features:Before buying these I read the forums raging about the terrible touch controls and lack of software features. I almost didn't purchase these because of the issue noted there. However, I am glad to report that the firmware and software updates have (mostly) solved most of these issues.1) You CAN skip tracks backward now. However, to do so, you need to set a custom ""shortcut"" touch control. You get either skip-forward OR skip-back, not both. You can select only one. The lack of simple skip forward or back controls baffles my mind. My $19 MPOW earbuds do this, and I think so do nearly every other earbuds on the planet. But at least we can finally skip backward now.2) Volume controls work well. I have no problem using the volume controls, and I never accidentally activate voice assistant while doing so (although I accidentally activate voice assistant for other reasons all the time, see below)3) You still cannot turn off voice assistant, and it will try to bud-dial your contacts if you let it. A long press on the right bud brings up the native voice assistant on your phone (Bixby for me, yuck). You cannot deactivate this feature. You WILL activate voice assistant holding these in your hand, or trying to pick them up from on a table. This is awful. Make it stop!Fit:Deal-breaker! (for me)The only real deal breaker here is that the ear tips DO NOT stay in my ears. By all the positive reviews, I assume these work fine for most people. I have very normal looking ears. The 'bud' portion of the tip doesn't actually stick into your ear canal. It is supposed to push against the opening, and remain there secured by the wings. That means if your ear geometry isn't exactly what the Bose engineers anticipated, the wings don't work, and the earbuds don't stay put. They fall out when casually walking around the store. Yes, I followed the instruction video. Yes, I tried all the sizes. Yes, I tried to get used to them for several days. No, they do not work. Not even a little.Many people have this problem. When they contact Bose on their forum (I haven't tried), Bose is kind enough to point them to the video that plays by default when you install the app, and tell them to try all the different ear tip sizes. That is their only response, even if the customer states that they already did this. I don't think Bose even reads these comments any more, because they can't fix it. Look at your ears in the mirror to decide if you think these will work, or just roll the dice and try 'em.Overall:These are really big. But they also sound great. But they are huge.

3.0,"Great sound, not for outdoors",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CDCBRR5550G8?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023",2023-01-18,United States,,"TLDR: These earbuds are a great selection with great sound quality and superb battery life. Noise cancellation is below par. If you want to only use one earbud at a time, it cannot be the left one.Long-winded review:I have been a long-time user of Bose. And these earbuds are a great option for most people.Pros: These earbuds have a great sound. Bass is good, as is the depth and quality of the overall output. They have a respectable battery life on their own, that is lengthened tremendously when paired with the case; it is easy to charge the case once a week and not much more. It’s hard to beat Bose’s construction and quality; these earbuds fit well (especially considering the range of earpiece sizes you can swap out) and take a long time to get uncomfortable, something I think is a great quality (I have mine in for >5 hours at a time and they don’t bother me).Cons: My main problem with these earbuds is the noise cancellation. Via the Bose app, you have the option of selecting how much ambient sound you want to eliminate from your audio. When indoors in an office environment, I have found this more than sufficient. However, when outside this feature breaks down. It does nothing to cancel wind noise, indeed, having these earbuds in when it’s windy makes the problem worse. I cannot use my earbuds outside when it’s even as low as a 3mph wind because all I’ll hear in my audio is wind. If you don’t exercise outside, walk with them, or otherwise won’t be using them outdoors, you’ll likely have no problems. The only other con I have to mention is minor: you cannot use just the left earbud. You can use the right earbud by itself and walk away from the case, and all will work fine. This is not true of the left earbud. If you pop in only the left earbud and close the case, the earbud disconnects. Kind of annoying but I don’t suppose it’s a major issue. I am mostly deaf in my left ear, so I don’t really need to use it anyway, but someone with the opposite problem, who cannot hear well out of their right ear would likely find this to be a major issue.",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],6.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1940.0,853.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds
3.0,I would rate these a little higher if it weren't for the microphone...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YBD4M3Y57FP3?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2022",2022-06-11,United States,,"Just for some background, I live with headphones in my ear for the majority of the day, so I knew I would put it through it's paces once I got it. Before these, I was strictly using airpods. But after my second pair in 2 years, it was starting to drag on me that I would have to replace the ones I currently had. Then a friend of mine recommended these and let me try his. From the moment I tried out the noise cancelling, I was sold. Sadly the feeling didn't last. The first pair I had died within a week. I used them a few times and then they stopped connecting to the phone before just outright never charging. I returned them and ordered a second pair because I thought maybe the first one was fluke as my wife and friend did not have that same issue. The second pair thankfully is still working though I do have connections issues from time.Pros:- The sound quality is on par if not better than the air pods I had.- When the noise cancellation is active, it really does drown out the background noise. Which is nice when I walk my dogs as is drowns out the noise of the busy street.- The shortcuts that allow me to adjust the noise cancellation level just by touching the headphones is also a great feature.- Battery life is also good as I'm only really charging the headphones once a week.Cons:- My biggest complaint is the microphone. I've given up on ever answering the phone with these headphones on. I don't know if it's because of the noise cancelling or what, but everyone I speak to complains that they can hear all of the background noise more than they can hear. I've tried trouble shooting and  adjusting the noise cancelling levels but still nothing changes.- The next issue I've had is with the fit. At first it was fine, but now I find that when I put the headphones in my ear, I keep having to adjust it because if the fit is wrong then I get a whistling sound coming through. It can get really annoying and also hurts because the adjustment causes a loud high pitch squeal until I find the right fit.Overall, the ear buds are good and for my day to day I find them to be good. But the fact that I keep having issues with the fit, where the only solution is to buy new rubber fittings, and the fact that the microphone just doesn't work right, keeps me from giving it a higher rating.",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],7.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1940.0,853.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds

This pair did not meet my expectations. My main problem is you must use the right earbud to get sound. The left earbud is not programmable to be use by itself. Even if you could use them separately, the battery life depletes simultaneously. The app for the earbuds did not provide any way to use the left earbud on its own it to use the earbuds separately. As a person who multitasks, I use one earbud until it dies and then switch. I have a small child and don’t wear both while doing chores, errands, or just around the house. My second problem was the need for the Beats Connect app to constantly update. I only had them for maybe a week and every time I’m in the app it’s updating. And lastly, no capability to locate individual earbuds.Pros: These are excellent for people with small ears, the design takes some getting used to. The noise cancellation works! I have to remove the single earbud in order to hear clearly. These would work better for me when I used to go to the gym or when I’m cooking and need to detach from my surrounding noise.I typically don’t leave poor reviews but wanted to give a review that I wish I could have seen prior to my purchase.

3.0,"AVOID power tools/very loud sounds, tinnitus (ringing in ears)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HW95G56E2CQT?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2021",2021-08-07,United States,,"Perhaps I could give this a higher star review and a word of caution.  First, these are amazing, comfortable, secure and the noise cancelling is really impressive.  I think if you're in a quite to moderate sound environments you'll love these--I did.Second, after repeating exposure to the noise cancelling mode in a structured and careful way I can say my experience using them with loud noises is convincing that these ear buds caused and now provoke my tinnitus on each reattempt.  I used these with a lot of power tools around the house every few weeks for about 6 months (mower, leaf blower, trimmer, circular saw, other saws, impact driver).  I list all of these tools specifically because I noticed that in the noise cancelling mode with each of these I developed onset of tinnitus (something I've never dealt with before when using normal ear protection).  When using these tools and noise cancelling mode I would occasionally get a sudden, nearly painful constructive interference with abrupt onset that stops within 1 to 3 seconds that I perceived as equal or louder than the noise I was trying to cancel out. With a circular saw (very loud tool) the loud sound in the earbuds would go much longer than 3 seconds (almost like a very loud crackling sound as long as the saw was being used).  I've googled this question of noise cancelling technology provoking tinnitus multiple times, but haven't found much to support an association.  Not sure if I'm unique, this was random failure of my specific device, inappropriate use of the technology by me, or I was more prone because of history of tools use (however, I'm really strict about my ear protection and that was my motivation to get these ear buds).  I've carefully repeated multiple experiments of exposure with these buds in noise cancelling mode trying to convince myself they are safe for me to use (because I love them!), but instead undeniably they are the problem.  Hope this is not happening to others.  Tinnitus is complex (see Ringing in the brain, Josef Rauschecker, TECx 1/23/2017), and little to nothing appears reported on an association with noise cancelling tech, so I'm assuming someone's risk without tools is little to none, though given my experience I have to believe there is risk to others with louder noise/tools/etc.  I'm mainly writing this review so that if others have this problem and search for ringing in the ears or tinnitus more might become clear whether this product or other noise cancelling technologies could be an avoidable exacerbating factor for tinnitus.",True,Color: WhiteStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],10.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1940.0,853.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds
4.0,"Excellent, but with some surprising shortcomings",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7AM8R07MXYG?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,39 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2021",2021-02-26,United States,,"I bought these to replace my Bose SoundSport earbuds, which finally gave up the ghost after about five years.A quick word about the SoundSport buds: I went through four different sets, all replaced at no charge--even when they were out of warranty. The first set stopped holding a charge after less than a year. Replaced. The switch on the right bud disintegrated after a year. Bose replaced the unit even though it was out of warranty. The left bud got very faint and ultimately stopped working altogether. Replaced out of warranty by Bose. The current one, which has worked well for about 18 months, has lost sound on the left bud. I figure I've gotten my money's worth, so I haven't contacted Bose this time--I just bought the QC instead.I mention my issues with the SoundSport because I have concerns about Bose's quality control, at least for that particular unit. I bought a pair of Apple AirPod Pro but returned them after a couple of days because I have an Android phone (Galaxy Note 20), and most of the attractive features of the AirPods don't work on my phone or are cumbersome.So I went for the QC with only minor reservations.Here's what I like about them:* They sound very, very good--better than my SoundSport. I listen mainly to audiobooks, which aren't particularly demanding, but the sound is noticeably better--even to my (ahem) ""older"" ears. (When you ride a motorcycle fast without earplugs for a lot of years, you pay a price. Pay attention, kids!) The music I listen to is largely acoustic--guitar, mandolin and violin. The sound is very pleasant, with good detail and strong bass. I don't have to turn the volume higher to get the nuances of the music. That is definitely a plus.* They are very secure in my ears and very comfortable--more so than their predecessor. I expect they'll stay put even when I work out and sweat heavily.* The noise canceling is spookily effective. I listen to audiobooks in my car, which has a fair amount of road noise. It's a Porsche, and I tend to drive pretty fast. The noise-canceling is good enough that I don't have to raise the volume. I have not tried different-sized ear tips but might see if the noise canceling is even more effective with a different size.* The QC works quite well for phone calls. I have had no complaints from people about intelligibility or noise. One very welcome feature is that I can adjust how much of my voice I can hear on calls. The SoundSport did not have that, so being able to hear myself when I talk on phone calls is good. I set the option to 100%.* The controls are okay: tap the right bud twice to answer or terminate a phone call, swipe up or down on the right bud to raise or lower the volume. Tapping twice on the right bud pauses and restarts the audio player.* The battery life is longer than I expected. I listen to audiobooks to fall asleep. I set the ""sleep"" function on my app to 10 minutes. In the morning, I still have about 20% battery after eight hours.* The charging case has been good for three full charges from 20% to full—also more than I expected. Some have complained about its size, but it's not uncomfortable to carry around in my pocket--it weighs 3.3 oz (93 grams) and measures 3.25"" x 2"" x  1.5"" tall (82 mm x 50 mm x 38 mm).There are some missing features, but they are not deal killers for me.* There is no way to fast forward through an audio program. The SoundSport allowed me to double- or triple-click and hold the control button on the mic to fast forward. There is no equivalent on the QC. I have to go to the phone for those functions.* The SoundSport went into sleep mode when not playing content. I was able to go a week between charges because of that feature. Also not a deal killer, as the battery life is longer than I expected with the QC.* There is no way to power the QC down other than putting them in the charging case.* There does not appear to be a way to locate a lost earbud--a ""find my bud"" feature. That is my biggest concern. There is still a video on the Bose site showing how to use Find My Buds--in the obsolete Bose Connect app. This is close to a deal killer. I cannot understand why this feature has been disabled in one of Bose's flagship products. The QC are quite a bit larger than the Apple product, so they won't be quite as easy to lose. I hope.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I use earbuds every day, so I am quite particular about getting a set that works well. So far, these fill the bill. I hope not to have to deal with the kinds of QC issues I had with the SoundSport.Bose offers a 90-day unconditional return policy, although I would have bought these without it.They are pricey, but I have always found that paying top dollar for the best quality winds up being the best investment over time.",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],1.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3924.0,930.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds

However, the noise cancelling feature did not seem to work though it briefly started to work when I kept adjusting the bud in my ear. Although I tried the three existing earpiece sizes and the optional sizes, noise cancelling never worked because I could never get a good ear seal. So, customer service upgraded me free to the new QC II version but with the same result. Pity; nice features!In all this, customer service was overly polite and more than willing to help. They quickly shipped me different parts to try and the QC II. However, they never did pick up on the problem being air seal in the ear.Having tried all I could with the buds, I switched to the headset/earphones. Success. That works and works fantastically. The downside of headphones is size; but, oh well. Objective achieved though not perfectly. I give the headphones a 5  for functionality.I give their customer service a 5 for prompt and courteous service and the QC buds a 4 since I could never get them to work.Final note, on exchange, they have to receive the returned item before shipping the replacement (reasonable). They do pay shipping in both directions.When noise cancelling worked, the result was fantastic: driving down the road at 45 - 50 miles per with driver-side window open wide, it was completely quiet in my ear. If only the story could end there. That evening, the bud firmware was updated. On the next day, disaster: on the APP dashboard, there was the volume slider bar as usual but no Noise Cancelling slider bar and there was NO noise cancelling at all.Next I followed all the setting checks and steps listed on the website with no success. I made two calls to support (one got cut off) and they had me rerun all the steps I had just run with no success. Here is where the quality issues arose. Their help desk (clearly an outsource to foreign service) had only the above set of steps for problem diagnosis and correction. One got the impression that they were reading a script rather than thinking and had no imagination. They also had no level II support to consult or to whom they could pass on the issue.Finally, they had never seen the kind of problem I had. Here I fault Bose. I the APP software had a way of completely eliminating the Noise Cancelling slider, the programmer must have had a reason which is likely related to missing information from the hardware or firmware. Why not tell them what to do when this was seen? As I have managed support efforts in the past, I think that it's possible that a little work might be needed here.Their solution is to exchange the buds with a new set. When those come in, I will update this review. I so hope that this resolves the issue because I like all features (cosmetics, charging case, appearance, noise cancelling system)!Wait, there's more. Their exchange is unlike the rest of the world: they wait until they have the old product physically in their hands!

4.0,Bulky & Awkward Fit / Sounds Amazing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRRZYQOIWPM6A?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,26 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2022",2022-10-04,United States,,"If you're planning on moving around a lot with these ear buds, you'll have complaints on ear-fit and wind static, a problem only exacerbated by very glichy software; but in terms of SOUND and noise cancellation, there's nothing better in the ear bud world. I use these primarily while I cross train, bike around town, or commute on the metro. A commuter's best friend, an athlete's bane.The bulk is kills them as hands-free devices during fast movement. They stick out the ear a LOT compared to Apple buds and their heavy to boot. This means that jumping around will dislodge them pretty quick unless you constantly adjust them in the ear (which I do, which is now my calling card at the gym - the girl who's ALWAYS fussing with her ear buds). The soft silicone bracket that hooks them in the ear are simply no match for their weight and, plus, if you're at all sweaty, the silicone gets slippery. For added tension, you can always try to up the size of the bracket, but no amount of tension is going to hold them in place when they're slippery. A light coating of felt would have alleviated some of this problem, but that wouldn't solve the problem of their overall bulk. That bulk catches wind like a cup and if you try to bike with these things, you won't hear anything but roaring wind rush pooling between your ear and the device.The constant need to readjust is made further annoying by the fact that the software is extremely glichy. If you have to constantly touch them, they're going to start doing weird things, like changing the noise-cancellation mode, stopping your music/podcast/call, switching your music/podcast/call, etc. EVEN IF YOU TURN OFF TOUCH CONTROLS, there's a level of touch sensitivity and software function that is simply built in to the device. Its so sensitive that the brush of a pony tail or shirt collar or a hat will start the device doing something you didn't want it to. As I said, it doesn't matter if you turn off touch controls in the setting; the thing has a life of its own.That software glichiness extends to other things like weird or inaccurate battery read-outs, the shutting off of one ear bud, and generally unfriendliness of use (from the iphone app). To change the noise cancellation mode, you have to click through three or four menus so if you have to move from a loud environment to a quiet one quickly, don't expect to be able to adjust the noise cancellation on a dime. You'll have to stop and scroll through menus galore.But they are the king of SOUND - simply the best I've ever heard and that's the reason I put up with them. In sound quality, they put Apple Pro's to shame. The Apple buds sound hollow and tinny compared to the lush surround-sound of the Boses'. The noise cancellation also puts the Apple buds to shame - they simply cancel out at least double the amount of white noise as the Apple's. Metro trains and airplanes - these things cancel out so much of it out, its AMAZING. Quiet and peaceful. Simply amazing. Plus, there's not enough motion or adjusting during a day-to-day commute to become annoying, its a beautiful way to travel.All in all, I find the sound quality and noise cancellation worth my constant wrestling with the fit or software, but how much patience you're willing to put into it is up to you.",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],5.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3924.0,930.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds
4.0,Outstanding sound and noise reduction; ear tips are a bit hard to get right; controls can be tricky,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N3Z3E67XG8BM?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2021",2021-11-22,United States,,"I bought these to replace a pair of Bose QC2's I'd had for years.  I like to use noise cancellation while I'm driving my tractor around on my ranch, but the QC2s, being wired, were a bit of a problem because the wire was always getting caught on something.  I decided to upgrade to these.First of all, the sound quality is amazing.  I'm hearing detail in songs that I'd never noticed before, even in the bass range (which is amazing for such a tiny speaker).  Of course, you'll get better bass from bigger speakers, but considering the size of these buds, I'm pretty well blown away by the ability to hear low tones loudly.  I was also pretty amazed by the noise cancellation in these; again, I wasn't expecting much from such small buds, but they block out probably 80% of the tractor noise, and when combined with a normal ear protection set, you might as well be in your own universe as far as engine noise is concerned.It took me a while to get them to fit properly, though.  I was unused to the ear-tip style of buds, and figuring out how to even position them in my ear was tricky.  But my biggest mistake was in not understanding what the sizes meant on the ear tips.  I have quite small ears, both pinna-wise and ear canal-size, and so I immediately tried using the smallest set.  They kept falling out of my ears, so I tried the medium ones -- those were better but they still had a tendency to fall out.  I finally realized that the sizes have nothing to do with the size of your ear canal or even the size of your pinnae -- they're actually relative to the distance from your ear canal to the back of the front fold of your pinna which, in my case, happens to be relatively far.  I used the largest set and finally they buds are staying in just fine; I could probably even run wearing them.The most problematic part of the buds are the controls.  It takes some training to control the volume via the right earbud; their documentation shows swipes going down the entire earbud, but in fact it seems to only involve the top half of the earbud in practice.  Putting in one bud will automatically start your music before the other bud is in, which I also find a bit annoying.  You can toggle noise cancellation by double-clicking the left bud, but instead of just quietly doing it for you, the software will announce which mode it's changing to, which is very annoying (and pretty unnecessary; you'll realize pretty quick whether it's on or off on your own).The charge case works well when placed on a normal QI charger.  (I thought the five LEDs on the front of the case were indicative of charge level, but it turns out that they aren't.)  The buds will completely lose their charge is sitting in the case for about a week (if you are not charging the case, that is), and I'm not comfortable leaving the case sitting on the charge pad for long periods of time, so I have to be planful about ensuring the buds are charged since I only use them a couple times a week.  My experience is that the buds only charge to about 90% (according to the Bose software), but the charge lasts for quite a while.  (In the 20 minutes it took me to type this, the charge really hasn't dipped at all, despite my having noise cancellation on and listening to music.)",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],6.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3924.0,930.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds

BUT the caveat is when you pull one or the other out to talk to someone it keeps playing the music or video. NOT a deal breaker by any means just kind of annoying.  Also double tap right ear to stop music etc. I have dry hands so controls seem to work better when there is some moisture on your finger tips. The different size ear tips hold them in great. But you will need to get use to them if you wear them for an extended amount of time. I bought these and went on a roadtrip right away. So like a baseball glove I ""broke"" my ears in lol. Now they don't bother me anymore after hours of being in my ear. Yes they are big but tbh I've asked my friends if they look weird and they said no . So not as small as my galaxy buds 2 (GARBAGE) that I had since they came out. Why the switch well the galaxy buds 2 have a case that the lid does not click shut like the Bose. So I had them on a carabiner and played a game of kickball at a birthday party.  Went home and to my surprise both buds were gone... Did a bunch of research and didn't want to spend more than $100 on new buds.  Ultimately I took a chance on these solely because I value noise cancelling so much.  I could not be happier!!! JUST get them and try them for 7 days I promise you will love them.  The only other drawback is the size of the storage case. I bought a case for the case so I can clip it to my belt loop but it's big and kind of awkward. The work around is now I just clip it to my always with me 64oz Bubba water bottle.  So if you leave your water bottle behind on occasion and your buds are in. Guess what, when you go to pull them out you won't have anywhere to store them.

I have been a Bose customer for many years, and have always loved their gear, so I was excited to receive my new Bose QC Earbuds today. Despite the ""rumblings"" of a growing lack of quality control at ""Bose Central"", and despite the few negative customer complaints I have read here and there, I chose to put faith in the shiny reviews that talk about the Bose quality noise cancellation, the comfortable fit and the high quality sound that I would expect from Bose's new earbuds.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. After receiving them and smiling as I opened the pristine packaging and pulling out the trademark smooth black case, I opened it, took out the beautiful black earbuds, followed the detailed instructions to fit and pair them to my iPhone, and was at the peak of my excitement when I heard distorted sound coming from only the left earbud.AN HOUR AND A HALF OF FRUSTRATING TROUBLESHOOTING. I tried calling Bose... no humans available. I followed all the instructions I could find on their website. I disconnected Bluetooth, I reconnected Bluetooth. I reset the earbuds, I tried to pair them with other devices that we own, Apple and others, no joy. I went to forums and began to discover a long line of people who are having the SAME ISSUE. One earbud works and the other does not. No solutions. I have the latest firmware, the earbuds and the case are fully charged and the right earbud simply does not work. To add insult to injury, the sound coming from the left earbud sounds like it is overmodulating, and while the feature to activate Siri does work, there is no connectivity between Siri and the earbuds, so it is impossible to use this feature.THE GOOD. The packaging is beautiful, the case that the buds nest in is sturdy and protective and has a great feel. The earbuds themselves are extremely comfortable and they felt great in my ears. The noise cancellation feature is absolutely Bose top notch.THE BAD. THEY DON'T WORK. I paid nearly $300 for these earbuds, and for the premium price I paid, I expected the premium quality performance that I have come to depend on from Bose.CONCLUSION.

The first chat confirmed there was nothing that could be done about the pair so they required replacement.  In that, they offered the newest available version (QuietComfort II) for $195 + tax BUT did require that I send the older/defective pair back.  A reference # was given so when I was ready to do this, I could inquire again.2nd time (2 days later) I chose ""Assist with Product Purchase"" but after 15 minutes was in the wrong department where I was then forwarded into Tech Support (who apparently have that capability).  I then proceed to take on their offer BUT am then informed that ALL MATERIALS have to be sent back too.  We're not just talking the ear buds - we're talking the case, charger, owner's manual, etc.  They REALLY expect us to have all of that to ship back to them as their way of proof that we are trying to replace!  My actual charger (not case - power adapter) was lost quite some time ago so I didn't have that.  I also don't have the box or owner's manual too (they mentioned wanting the manual, but maybe even the box it came in??).  WHO HAS ALL OF THAT?!

I hung in there a bit longer since the guy said he was going to ask his team members for anything they could offer.  All he did was copy/paste their usual BS statements to me, never giving me any kind of offer!

I've literally went through FOUR PAIRS of these, and all of them eventually, within weeks, stopped working, for some odd reason. Let me explain with all of them.FIRST PAIR - Bought from Best Buy. After about 3 weeks, the left earbud didn't charge anymore. No damage was done. No drops, no water damage, nothing. The battery ran out, then it just stopped working. I called BOSE, no help. They told me to send them back. Forget that. I went back to Best Buy, and then I got a new pair.SECOND PAIR - I get my second pair from Best Buy. I go home and open them, and I KID YOU NOT, as soon as I get home, the RIGHT earbud isn't working. At this point, I go to Amazon to order a new pair, just in case, but I go BACK to Best Buy, and I exchange again.THIRD PAIR - After about a week of using this pair, my right earbud again just unsynced, for some reason. All of the voice over is in the left earbud now, but the right earbud is effectively dead. It can charge, but it doesn't sync to the left earbud. Literally tried everything. Factory Reset. Turn off phone, turn on. Reinstall all apps... nothing works. I give up on this brand, so I take back to Best Buy and get the WF-1000XM4s. I had them before, and they didn't fit my ear well (which is why I got the QuietComforts, because of the wingtip), but I figured I might just try it again with the XM4s... a working earbud is better than ones that don't work, obviously.FOURTH PAIR - I figured that since I already bought a pair from amazon, and they are sitting around, waiting to be sent back, I might as well just test them out to compare features with the XM4s (sound quality, noise cancelation, fitment, etc). About 3 hours in to using the NEW pair, the right earbud started to produce a loud, annoying static humming. It doesn't produce in the left earbud, but it's in the right one. Music still plays, but that humming static echo thing will never be OK.SUMMARYIt's a shame that the software BEHIND the earbuds don't work, because everything else is just so good.

I can attest that these are the worst headphones I've ever used, and more generally, one of the worst technology products I've ever owned. Just a few of the issues I've had are:1. While the sound sync lag on Mac and Android seem to be imperceptible, on Windows it is hit-or-miss (and more often than not, miss). Virtually every time I want to watch a video, you must use the Windows audio troubleshooter to correct the sound lag. And yes, if you go from one video to another on YouTube for instance, you will need to re-sync each time. I own other Bluetooth headphones that work flawlessly on all platforms.2.  The battery life is good, *when it charges properly*. This product advertises that, like all wireless in-ear headphones, it charges while dormant in the case. However in practice it's completely random: sometimes it will be fully charged after hours in the fully-charged case; other times, in spite of the case being fully charged, the headphones will be depleted of battery life.3. Switching it between devices is very difficult and time consuming. In theory, the Bluetooth button should allow you to switch between devices just by pressing it. However, it never works. In fact, sometimes pressing it to switch devices has the counter-productive effect of switching to the next device, if it auto-connects to the desired one at the same time. In addition, the headphones waste several seconds of time by announcing the battery life and the device it has connected to before providing you with the desired audio. Because of this issue, I just wait for the headphones to cycle through all other devices (which I must turn off) until it gets to my desired one.4. The Bluetooth button often gets physically stuck. This is unfortunate, as you are completely reliant on the button to properly connect to your desired device because of the issues mentioned in (3) above.5. Most of the time, you will hear an unpleasant screech come out of one or both of the headphones when you first place them in your ear. At first it was not often, but in time the problem has become worse and worse.6. Updates using the Bose updater appear to degrade the quality of the product. I have discontinued the use of the updater as each time I update, a new issue occurs with these headphones.In all, I would strongly recommend against these headphones.

At that moment the headphones go into what's called Awareness Mode or Aware Mode or awareness mode actually increases the sound and then all of a sudden I hear a bunch of screaming it's coming from the racquetball court. It sounds like somebody's then mortally wounded. But it's merely that the software automatically turned off my “full noise protection” and gave me “full noise awareness”. The sounds more loud and more amplified. I am confused I don't understand why I am hearing a sound that is so loud. I believe my hearing has been damaged. I am a hearing-impaired person already so the last thing I want is more damage from obnoxiously loud sounds. There is supposed to be a setting to make it go back to the same mode each time, but something happens each time and it always goes to the Aware Mode which is the default mode. If not for this I would have been satisfied with these headphones and I would have given them a higher star rating, but I am just too upset. My degree of upsetness has colored my entire image of this product and that's why I can only give it the lowest rating. The only positive thing I can think of is that I could actually use these as hearing aids when they're in their Awareness Mode because then I'd have sounds amplified into my ears but I already have hearing aids and I don't like them and I don't wear them. This is not wanted I want to block out sound and not amplify it I don't understand why Bose will not fix this. I have contacted the company many times and I am ignored each time I do so. If they will not turn off Aware Mode perhaps they could create a new software that would eliminate Aware Mode?

1.0,Disappointed by these wireless ear buds,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3STVRBG22CBCM?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,20 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2022",2022-08-06,United States,,"I have a Bose mini speaker and it’s sound quality is absolutely phenomenal. I figured if the Bose wireless ear buds have a sound like my Bose mini speaker then I definitely have to have them.When I got them and charged them for awhile, I attempted to pair them with my IPhone 13 Pro Max so I could hear my favorite downloaded music. I couldn’t pair them so I saw that I was supposed to download a Bose wireless ear bud app from the App Store which I did. The app supposedly had a pairing page on it and it would even say “ear buds were successfully paired” to my IPhone. This was not true as I could not listen to my music with these ear buds. I was confused because Bose then offered an different app that I could use to pair and manipulate the sound quality and I down loaded that one only to get the same results; unable to pair. In my IPhone settings the Bluetooth found the Bose ear buds pairing but it was unable to pair with them even when I tried and tried. I desperately wanted these ear buds to use when doing cardio at my gym.I decided to send them back and buy a new pair of Bose wireless earbuds as maybe the ones I sent back were defective.When I received my second pair I went through the same steps and hoped I would have better luck with this new pair of Bose wireless earbuds. Nope! I still couldn’t successfully pair these replacement ear buds with my IPhone. So I had to send back both pairs of Bose’s wireless earphones. I had so much hope for them and I am disappointed in their being unable to pair up with my IPhone. It’s possible Apple wants me to buy their crappy, bland, white colored ear buds, so they possibly sabotaged the Bose ear buds to induce me to buy their ear buds. Or Bose purposely sold me a defective product with the intention of only wanting the information I submitted to them e.g., my name, email and other info that they can then sell to second or third parties or just for their algorithms. I may have to go with Beats but I read that they don’t work half the time, charging only one ear bud or not work at all.

Was really excited, have had the Sony XM4 headphones for the past few months and love them. Was a close call between getting them and the latest Bose QC headphones but went with the Sony. Love them.I decided I want noise canceling earbuds as well but for earbuds I went with Bose because I read reviews saying the XM4 earbuds are not good for running or working out at all but the Bose are. I was excited to ditch my $30 gym 'wireless' earbuds from Anker (wireless but have the wire connecting the two earbuds).These Bose earbuds are junk. Wow. Here's why I rated them 1 star and immediately returned them:- The fit. The medium sized earbuds that come preinstalled won't stay in for more than a few seconds even without moving my head. The large fit better but in no way stay in with any movement. Small is laughably small. All this and I don't even have big ears. But I know earbud fits as I've had dozens of pairs over the past 10-20 years. These don't fit at all!- Noise cancelling. How can they call it noise canceling if I have it turned all the way up but can still hear everything around me in a quiet home and can even carry on a conversation with my wife? Seriously. I had the noise canceling turned all the way up in the app with music playing and we were able to have a conversation. Easily, I might add. I didn't have to turn the music down nor take out an earbud.- Sound quality. While I only gave a few songs on a few different music apps a listen, it all sounded very, very bad. There's no bass whatsoever and everything sounds so poor. There's no equalizer either so you get what you get.For the life of me I can't understand the 5-star reviews. Either these earbuds fit a lot of people perfectly enough to make up for the crap noise canceling or people just don't know how good and true noise canceling can sound. It's hard to imagine any other scenario aside from fake reviews.If you want a $20 quality in earbud audio for music with advertised noise canceling that doesn't even work and for earbuds that may not fit your ear well at all, then these $300 earbuds from Bose will suit you just well.

Bose doesn’t care.  I have tried to reach customer service to try and warranty these and I get a runaround. Connecting to a different device other than the one you started with is awful.

I certainly don’t expect the battery to drain that fast.Don’t expect Bose to do anything if your past the 30 day return window on Amazon.

5.0,Great replacement for some defunct AirPods Pro,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32ZTO5TSLPXX2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2023",2023-12-20,United States,,"My Apple AirPods Pro set finally started rusting up after several years of use and I wasn't a huge fan anyhow, so thought I'd try the Bose QC earbuds for something different.  What I've noticed is that the sound is markedly better and, the ear clips are perfect - I can wear them comfortably for hours, but also they stay in place perfectly when jogging, etc.  The battery life on these is astounding; I've had them close to 6 months now and still am amazed how long they last.  The noise cancelling (cancelling outside noise and letting you hear just the music) is pretty good for earbuds.  And they're durable: I accidentally dropped one of the earbuds when I bumped one ear and it fell into a grass-covered pool of saltwater, and I couldn't find it for 15 min - then had to pull it out / dry it off.  That was several months ago and still works perfect.Only issue I have is that the microphone has always worked horribly for audio calls...  I basically don't use these for calls at all, because in any situation (esp those with even slight outside noise), they somehow make me sound very muffled and folks have a hard time understanding me.  Also the microphone picks up the tiniest extraneous noise (like a passing car or bird chirping) really loudly and I'm told this is super-distracting for the person on the other line.

5.0,Full of compromises but not when it comes to ANC.***Update***,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2526IIXX33WJN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,"1,480 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020",2020-11-05,United States,,"There is an awful lot to like about the Bose QuietComfort Noise Cancelling Earbuds. I will break down the good and the bad below but, suffice to say, these are possibly the most polarizing ear buds I have ever had on. I guess that makes it the perfect set of buds for 2020. Here is the breakdown:The good:-Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): We can just get this out of the way. If you want best in class noise cancellation on an earbud, these are the set to get. Period. I have the class leading Sony ANC earbuds, the new Technics, the Samsung Galaxy Live, and have spent extensive time with the Airpod Pros. All have solid ANC but none can approach a good set of over ears. My over ear Sony WH-1000XM3's put them all to shame when it comes to turning off the outside world. I am not ready to say that these Bose buds can duplicate that level of ANC but it is close. When you get a good seal and have the adjustable ANC level on 10, the world is gone. I was out hanging Halloween decorations a couple weeks ago and my neighbor across the street was mowing his lawn. It looked comical. It appeared that he was mowing with the mower turned off. I couldn't hear it. Once I realized the trick the ANC was doing, I strained my ears to really focus and try to hear anything. Nothing. Finally, I plucked an earbud out and there it was, loud lawn mower. If great ANC is the mission, stop right now, and just buy these.-Sound: Like all Bose products, these sound great. A few years ago, I would be raving about them. They have the classic signature Bose warm tonality, nice solid bass, a full mid section, and crisp resonating highs. However, after using products from Klipsch, Sennheiser,  B&O, and my other afformentioned ANC earbuds, either my taste in sound has changed or my expectations have. I recently received a set of new wireless earbuds from Shure and they sound unbelievable. The detail and sound stage are amazing. These just don't sound as good. They are better than any of my buds from Samsung or Jabra for sure and in the same arena as the others. For this price, I guess I was hoping for more. One challenge may be that Bose doesn't give you the ability to customize your sound. You can customize your ANC experience just not your sound. It has to be the way Bose wants you to hear them. Frankly, this is a stunning omission. They have a great app. Just not sure how or why you leave that out. Maybe someday an update can remedy this. In the meantime, these buds sound great. Just know that at this price, there are earbuds that sound a bit better out there.-Connection / Pairing: As you would expect, these come with the latest and greatest chip set as well as Bluetooth 5.1. To pair just download the Bose Music app and follow the directions. You will be all set in maybe ten seconds. Range is great. 30 plus feet through walls. All is exactly as you would expect from a high end set of buds.-Intangibles: Bose gives you a very fancy auto pause they call auto transparency. Pluck a bud from either ear and the others ANC turns off. Pretty slick but there isn't a regular touch pad transparency mode. Weird. You get quick charging (5 minutes on nets 2 hours use) via USBC and Qi wireless charging. Good stuff.The bad:-Form factor: There is no other way to put this. These Bose buds are big. HUGE actually. While everyone else is going small, Bose went big. Some of this must be to accommodate the internals of the buds themselves. I am also guessing that, in order to get a good seal, like an over ear, they determined that they needed the extra size. Oddly, in spite of this size, they are quite comfortable and lightweight. So, while I am hitting Bose for an overall negative here, if you can live with the look, you will not mind how they feel. One more note here, you really need to try all three sets of wings as you need to get a good seal in order to experience their magical ANC.-Battery life: Not a negative but definitely NOT a positive. Less than six hours on bud for me. That's in line with my other ANC buds but you would think Bose could squeeze a little more out of these since they are like satellites hanging out of your ears. Further, the case is large. I took a couple pictures next to my other buds for perspective. You only get two more charges there. Should be at least three. There is an external LED battery life indicator which is well done. All and all just should be better.-Controls: For buds this big, Bose should let you control everything here. Instead, you have very limited pause/play, ANC controls, etc. No volume. No track control. These are big omissions. Pretty much means your phone always need to be at your side. Just not acceptable.The Wrap:Listen, I have been pretty hard on these. I feel like at $279, I should be. However, I will say this. After a few days, I 100% planned on returning these. Yet, here I am a couple of weeks later and they haven't left my side. I am not sending them back in spite of all of their shortcomings. They sound great but, more than anything, when you hit the ANC on these, the world around you vaporizes. These days, I can live with an awful lot of compromises in order to make that happen. Cheers to the Bose team on making a classy yet odd looking set of buds that give you world class ANC.***Update*** I have lived with these now for a few weeks. The things I hit these for still bother me but my original 4 star review is being moved to a 5 star. There are a few reasons for this. First, while huge, I just love wearing these. They are super comfortable for long sessions. They don't jam into your ear canal but simply push against it. The Bose design team deserves a lot of credit here. They are just really well made. Something I didn't fully grasp when I wrote my initial review. Plus, they actually look kind of cool.  Secondly, as I said originally, the ANC really is amazing. Every day I use them I am more and more blown away. They just literally make the world disappear. Lastly, they sound great. I still long for an EQ option in the app but I don't really miss it in real world use. Here is the bottom line; I have a drawer full of high end earbuds and headphones. For the last few weeks, I grabbed my Samsung Live Buds once. Every other day I have reached for these. They are just simply the best buds I own. That doesn't mean that my prior criticisms aren't reasonable. It just means that everything these do well they do really well. They aren't inexpensive but, if you can pull it off, I highly recommend making the investment.***Update 2.0***So one of my major gripes just got a little better. Bose just updated their app and it now includes a toggle to add volume controls on bud. You will find this toggle in your settings. Simply flip volume control on and you can now swipe up and down on the right bud to control volume. It is very well done. There is still some work to do on this front but we are getting there. Keep up the support Bose.One more update here that I think is relevant. In the last few months, I have added both the Master and Dynamic MW08's and Bowers and Wilkins new buds to my arsenal. Both cost more. The Bose represent themselves very well in this premium group. Both the M&D's and the B&O's sound a bit better. The B&O's are actually shockingly good in the way they sound. However, none of them hold a candle to what these can do with ANC. They are just so good at removing the world around you. Of ANC is the objective just buy these.

However, at night, I could hear my ears ringing. I became very concerned about this, so I looked into ANC earbuds and ordered these Bose QuietComfort and the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds.After trying both of them for a week, the Bose QuietComfort earbuds were noticeably quieter and better at handling ambient noise and thus listening at lower volume than the Sony WF-1000XM4. The Sony WF-1000XM4's audio quality was about the same as Bose, perhaps a bit better, but what good is this if it isn't very effective at blocking ambient noise and you have to raise the volume to appreciate it, which is precisely what I do not want?So, I returned the Sony WF-1000XM4 and kept the Bose QuietComfort earbuds, which also sound very good and fantastic when you're streaming Master quality tracks. I was blown away by the audio quality when listening to Master quality tracks vs the regular tracks, what a huge difference!I also compared them with my daughters' Air Pods Pro and what a joke. The Apple Air Pods Pro ANC paled in comparison to the Bose and the audio quality was worse, it was awful. There is simply no comparison.These earbuds are so good at blocking ambient noise, that I no longer carry the Bose ANC 700 headphones when I travel! Yes folks, they are that good and much easier to carry! I've set many times on the wing area of airplanes and these earbuds work their magic all the time!They are very comfortable to wear and stay on once in place, the touch controls are very accurate, the voice assistant is great, answering and making calls is very good, no complaints from the other party, well built, as I've dropped them several times and they continue working without any issues.Battery life is also great! I workout on average for 90 minutes, if the gym is too busy I'll easily clock in 120 minutes, without any low battery warning. I wipe them, put them back in their case, and they're ready to go the following day. I workout 5 times a week, and I will not recharge the case for almost a month!And the best part about them is that these earbuds have saved my hearing, since I listen to them at about 1/3 the volume I was listening to with the other non ANC earbuds I had, and I no longer hear any ringing in my ears at night!Now, recently I had the opportunity to acquire the Bowers & Wilkins PI7 earbuds.And yes they do sound better than the Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds, in fact noticeably better than all of the earbuds I tried, but they are after all much pricier, and despite this, their ANC and especially the battery life, is not as good as the Bose QuietComfort earbuds.So for the office, I use my Bowers & Wilkins PI7's, because of their outstanding audio quality, but outside of it, Bose takes the prize for checking all the boxes!I therefore highly recommend these Bose QuietComfort earbuds, because you may not know it, but they'll save your hearing!",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sDuFcPRYL._SY88.jpg'],3.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,24860.0,4205.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds

I've owned the Bose Sport earbuds for around a year, and they have the same fins. They've never once fallen out. (I've lost every other earbud that I've used at one time or another.) The QC buds feel just as secure and just as comfortable as the Sport buds.They are fairly large compared to other earbuds, but it's not noticable when I'm using them. Also, the case is pretty big, but I don't carry the case around in my pocket, so that doesn't bother me either.Call quality is pretty good. Everyone says they can hear me well.If you're trying to decide between the Sport or QC earbuds, I think the QC have only slightly better sound when listening to music, but the noise cancelling makes a big difference. You can hear everything better without the background noise, even at lower volume. The call quality, however, is significantly better with the QC.Right now, it's tempting to leave these on from the time I get home from work until I go to bed. They're very comfortable, and the noise isolation is quite peaceful. Hopefully I'll still like them this much in a month or 2.Update for the QC2:I've always been a function over form kind of person, so I didn't really care what the original QC buds looked like (the extra large size that everyone complains about), and maybe I'm showing my age, and I might be the only person on the planet that says this, but I think the first generation QC buds were more comfortable. The QC2s go farther into my ear canal, and my ears get sore a lot more quickly. Yes, they do look a significantly  more stylish. I would also trade the new, smaller case for the first gen case that has a row of indicator lights that show how much charge is remaining. The new case has one solitary light that flashes different colors to tell me something 🤷🏼‍♂️ in some sort of indiscernible Morse code. The older, larger buds are also easier for me to handle. The new ones are like slippery, squirrelly jumping beans that never go where I'm trying to put them.But..... These new buds sound really good. I mean, they sound good enough that I'm not even considering returning them. The ANC is unbelievable, and the bass has even more punch than the first gen. They have a nice clean sound, like every other Bose product, and my ears are gradually tolerating them longer each time I use them. I'm keeping the first generation buds for when my ears get sore, or when the battery dies because I couldn't decipher the inscrutable case light, but I'm using the new ones most of the time.For me, the sound quality negates all other quibbles.

Sony's WF-1000xm4 earbuds just came out as well and have have retaken the ANC crown. They also sound better. But these are still more comfy and have more touch control options. I've loved both.To preface, I may not be an audiophile, but I love earbuds and headphones. I have bought and tried a ton, and of the ANC ones, I've tried all 5 major players right now (Sony WF-1000XM3, Sennheiser Momentum TWS 2, Jabra Elite 75t/85t, Airpods Pro, and Bose QC Earbuds).The Bose QC earbuds have the best ANC bar none and it's not even close. This was enough to justify any other con these earbuds may have. To give context, I recently was on a commercial flight with these, the Sennheiser TWS 2, and the Sony WH-100XM3 and XM4 over-ear headphones. These freaking beat out the over-ear headphones! I know it sounds crazy, but I am not joking when I say these clearly cut out more plane noise than all of those. Reviewers always say ""adjust your expectations"" when it comes to ANC cuz these are smaller than actual headphones, but I always though that was bogus. ANC should cancel out a large degree of noise, whether you have headphones or earbuds, and paying a premium for any product that does it partially well is a waste of your money. ANC should not be a gimmick, and these prove that god tier ANC has arrived to earbuds.Sound quality isn't the best, but it was plenty good enough. People complain about not having an EQ in the app, but if it's that important to you, just download Wavelet.Now for the cons, which to me, aren't really even a big deal.- Yes, they're huge (buds and case), but the buds justify their size with the ANC performance and theyre light, comfortable, and stable. If the case bothers you because it sticks out of your pocket all the time then for pete's sake put in your bag or something. It's not that hard.- Battery life IS much lower compared to every other earbud, that's true. But let's be honest, are you really gonna notice if you have to charge once a week vs. once every 2 weeks. Not really.- Bad app connection: maybe I was lucky, but I never had this problem. If you are struggling to connect to the app, uninstall the app and erase your buds pairing connection to your phone. Then download the app first and follow the instructions step-by-step, including re-pairing your earbuds. That worked for me.- Controls: some people don't like touch controls, but I personally like these ones, especially since they now have volume control. The only thing you can't do it go back a track, which is honestly the least useful function anyways.In short, buy the buds. ANC and sound quality are more than enough to justify price and ""cons"".

5.0,Great Value Proposition,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KZGBFAB5XFAT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,105 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2022",2022-07-28,United States,,"Background: I’m an audiophile who is about $4.5k deep in his stereo setup so it is surprising to say this but I really dig these earbuds. Bose usually targets non-audiophiles as their sound signature is a “sculpted” V shape whereas audiophiles look for neutrality or a straight line across the frequency spectrum.The Value Proposition: With that in mind, I think people overestimate the ability of more expensive wireless options like the Sony and Senhesier to deliver that neutrality, regardless of earbud/over-ear design. Most of us use iPhones as music players which don’t accept hi-res wireless codes and are a PIA to use with wired headphones without carrying around a radio shack/dongle city. These Bose look like a comparatively good value: at $200 they undercut the companies mentioned above that have ANC earbuds which are $280 and $250. That it just more than I want to spend on a pair of earbuds, which typically have a short shelf life anyway due to loss, poor build quality, depleting battery life, and rapidly changing tech…Sound: these are a far cry from the first Bose I owned, the OG quiet comforts in middle school with the battery box built into the 3.5mm cable. Dynamic range, note-to-note distinction, and tonal accuracy are improved significantly. They’re much more musical even if detail retrieval isn’t top of the line. But how could it be with standard AAC, SBC codecs? Moreover, even if they did have more advanced codecs like APT-X HD and LDAC, my iPhone is my mobile music player and doesn’t accept them anyway. So really unless you’re on Android, paying for them is a waste of money. You’re not getting the data. Overall; sound signature is controlled, bass heavy, and musical if not neutral. I can live with it for a mobile solution because I do critical listening at home due to the inherent compromises of mobile, which leads to my next point nicely.Active Noise Cancellation: This is where these earbuds shine. Whether you’re living in the city, commuting to work by train, dealing with construction, trying to mow the lawn, whatever: these babies block out the world with the best ANC I’ve heard in an earbud and you are immersed in your music. I accidentally turned on my 1100W stereo in the next room to 50% volume with a butt dial and had no idea it was playing while wearing these. Without this quiet space, you’re wasting your time trying to hear the music in detail. That is why I think these are an incredible value proposition that make sense for a mobile solution.Battery: It’s fine, expected 6 hours without the charging case. That is better than Apple by several hours. I expect to have these for 3 years and then upgrade to something with longer battery life as technology improves and lithium ion depletes with age.Calls: They’re great, I use them for Zoom calls almost every day. If they could connect to multiple devices at once that would be cool, but it is no dealbreaker.Build Quality: Last but not least, audiophiles know that with consistent use wear and tear happens so we prioritize a robust build that will hold up with thousands of hours of listening. These things deliver. I’ll take the bulkier case with a stronger hinge. The slightly bigger earbuds are fine because they’re built solidly.  I just can’t get on board with the chintzy Apple/Beats products that look like they’re built from dollar store plastics, like they’re going to fall apart in 6 months. Same thing for cheap alternatives from Anker and similar budget brands (you get what you pay for).Wrap Up: mobile music listening is full of compromises and I think Bose has created an excellent product that delivers where it counts. If you want to do critical listening, do yourself a favor and invest in a pair of open-back headphones and amp at home or better yet a stereo setup you can enjoy with others. What Hi-Fi is a good, accessible place to start for recommendations and Stereofile is more advanced. For everything else, when I’m running around doing errands, on the plane next to a screaming baby, or just trying to cut down the noise of traffic/construction while working, these will deliver nicely.

These do such a good job of isolating the sound of my music so that it's the only thing I hear, which is perfect for me. I don't want to hear the noises of the city, and with these on, I don't have toI know there are better ANC options in the form of on-ear/over-ear headphones, but those are too big and usually make my ears feel clammy & sweaty. So I went with these, since I've used Bose wired earbuds before and love Bose headphones that I STILL have (it's 5 been years, maybe more)In the boxIt comes with 3 swappable ear tips so that you can have the best fit for your ears (the medium size comes on the earbuds by default). And charging case, which houses the earbuds themselves. As well as a USB to USB-C cable to charge the case with.Let's get the bad stuff out of the way:The charging case, I saw the reviews saying the case was big, and then I saw the customer pictures and thought that it wasn't so big. I was wrong, this thing is HUGE. You can't really tell just how tall the charging case actually is. Don't expect to put this case in ANY kind of pocket, be prepared to carry the case in a bag. This wasnt a huge deal for me since I carry a bookbag everywhere I go. The case itself opens with the push of a button, not with a magnetic lid. I don't think this is a pro or con, i didn't mind it when I got used to it.Lack of touch control features, with the touch controls you can swap between three levels of ANC (0%, 50%, and 100% by default, but you can change thee presets on their app), skip to the next track, raise the volume, pause/play music and answer/end calls. You can also bring up your phone's voice assistant (for me it was the Google assistant). This is it... You CANNOT go to a previous track to repeat it, or turn the volume down. I do wish I had the ability to change what the touch controls do, since personally, I do not use the Google assistant feature or swap noise cancellation levels at all. Which would have freed up those gestures for volume down and previous track. On top of the fact that this next feature makes the swappable ANC levels obsoleteOther:When you take one earbud off, it pauses your media (assuming you have music playing) and turns off active noise cancellation, which is nice when you are trying to have a conversation.Putting on the headphones so that they 'seal' against your inner ears is actually very easy. Their app shows you how to properly put on the headphones, for a perfect seal every time (i know it seems trivial, you should just put them in your ear right? Nah there's a technique to it lol)The battery life is nothing to write home about, but i didn't feel like they died too quickly. I only needed then to commute to and from work, and during my lunch break, which is only 3 hours a day, and i charge them every night. They don't have the best battery life but they don't die on me every hour either. At the end of an hour ii am usually at around 80% battery on each earbud. I also place them in their charging case between use and that is enough to get me through the day.The Good:The sound quality and noise cancellation is top notch. Which is no surprise, since that is what Bose does best. I seriously cannot put into words just how amazing these sound, and how well they isolate my music from the world around me. I played around with turning the ANC on and off in the app and i was honestly shocked at how much noise was being cancelled by the earbuds. it almost seems criminal to talk so much about the few features i didn't care too much about, and talk so little about what i bought these earbuds for, which they do an amazing job at, but honestly there's not much i can say other than they are amazing in both sound and ANC.TLDR; If all you care about is sound quality and  ANC, and want them in an earbud form factor, look no further. Get these.If the quality of life features such as gesture controls and portability are the primary reasons you are looking wireless earbuds, i think you can find more affordable options.",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],7.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,24860.0,4205.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds

5.0,No Comparison!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVZRXC893QTKG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2021",2021-06-09,United States,,"*WARNING*- Lengthy (but Comprehensive) Review:So, when I recently upgraded my phone to a Samsung S21+, there was no longer a headphone port.  (Yes, I’m that old!)  Because I rely on music when I run, I began researching wireless alternatives.  Consistently rated at the apex of wireless buds were Bose and Sennheiser.  I first bought Sennheiser (Momentum True Wireless 2) because of the price difference and the rave reviews on Amazon, independent sites, and YouTube.  They cited Sennheiser’s superior sound, excellent noise cancellation, customizable touch controls, small bud & case size, comfort, and the in-app equalizer.To back up a bit:  I'm a nut about my music - always messing with equalizers because I listen to *all* types of music.  For me, classical requires more mid/upper range so you can *hear* the resin in the strings section, hip-hop - more bass (but not too much or it gets mushy), hard/alternative rock - more mid-range and lower so you can hear everything without blowing out your eardrums ... you get the idea.  So that was a big draw - that and the size and comfort mentioned in many reviews.I *almost* kept them, but then within about 30 minutes of use, my ears got sore.  I switched out the pads which helped, but eventually my ears would start hurting again.  I also noticed that the sound, while good, tended toward ""tinny"" - as though the preset equalizer was too high.  Also, the noise cancellation didn't cancel completely.  Equalizers can be adjusted, but you can't do a thing about the cancellation quality or the physical discomfort.SO, I bought Bose QC to compare the two.Bose left Sennheiser in the rear view -- *way back* - NO COMPARISON – case closed!  As with most German engineering, these blew away any and all competition!  Yes, I’m aware Sennheiser is also of German origin, which is probably why they are top notch, but QC delivered the customary rich Bose sound, and justified its product name:1.  Quiet - I see my cat's mouth moving, but no sound - like a tv on mute.2.  Comfort – I forget I’m wearing them!Major negatives from other reviewers mention:• oversized buds• large case size• case button release• no “back” option• no equalizer in the app• expensiveSo, addressing each of these:• buds are big but non-obtrusive & very light• large case- definitely true, but I don’t carry buds in my pocket• case button release – why this is an issue is beyond me.  It’s actually more secure than a magnet.  (Think of BMWs – you have to pull the door handle *twice* to open the door once they auto-  lock.  Some people complain about this, but maybe BMW’s just asking, “Do you *really* want to  exit the car at 70 mph?”)• Skipping forward/backwards – I don’t care to scroll through playlists song-by-song to find the right  one.  I’ve always used apps to do that, so not an issue for me.• No embedded equalizer – whatever music app you use has an equalizer under settings.  Those can  be pre-set or manipulated manually.  Knowing this, Bose likely skipped this in its app to keep it  running quickly, which it does.• Expensive – you get what you pay for!Bottom line- returning the Sennheiser buds was a no-brainer.  The expense was worth it to me for all the reasons above.

5.0,Comparing this with Sony wf-1000xm4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7OSLOSX1XUYD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2021",2021-07-28,United States,,"I've recently purchased both Sony and Bose noise-cancelling earbuds and I have some fresh thoughts I'd like to share.Spoiler: I chose the Bose one.I tried both in New York in different situations, like in busy streets, during phone calls, playing music etc.So, to start with, the sound quality and noise cancellation of both devices are superb. I'll stick with the details.In general, the Bose one makes you truly disconnect from the outside world - It is so comfortable and light that you forget you're wearing them. Noise cancellation works perfectly well and really shuts down the external noises. The only issue I saw when comparing with Sony is that I could hear my footsteps, which was a bit annoying when walking.The Sony one, on the other hand, is really uncomfortable. It's not just a matter of changing the tips, the actual plastic case goes inside your ear, and that's not adjustable. To make a perfect fit you have to rotate the case and after a day wearing them my ears were hurting a lot. You just feel them all the time.Also, I didn't feel like it disconnected me from the outside world. It makes me feel like I'm wearing a helmet - like my head is inside a fishbowl or something. Although the noise cancellation is great, it doesn't make the outside world completely quiet. Think of it as the sound you hear when you cover your ears with your hands. It's very very subtle, but hey, I'm here to analyze the details.Furthermore, with Sony, when Ambient Sound is on, external noises sound flat, and you don't know where they're coming from - I heard sounds coming from the left when their sources were actually on the right.During calls, the person on the other side of the call had a much stronger preference over the Sony ones.When I was wearing the Bose ones, they said the noise was loud and uncomfortable, and by switching to  Sony in the same location, they reported it as sounding much quieter.Now, what REALLY turned me off with the Sony one is this: NOISE CANCELLING DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY DURING CALLS! It's basically a feature for you to hear your own voice, but it's super frustrating to be sitting quietly with the earbuds, then making a phone call, and all of a sudden you can hear everything around you. Noise cancellation gets turned off or at least is greatly reduced.Bose has that feature too but you can turn it on and off and even adjust the sensibility.Both apps seem to have similar sets of functions and I will not go through them here as it's already too long. The only thing worth mentioning to me is that you can use the equalizer for the Sony one. Bose just sticks with its standard sound profile, which is good enough.Also, I read a comment here that you can only pair the Sony earbuds with a single device, and that is completely false, as I've paired it with multiple devices and could switch between them very easily.Now trust me, I was super happy with the Sony ones until I tried the Bose ones. It really makes a difference. Even with my points above, I almost kept the Sony one. Here's why:With Bose i can hear my footsteps, and that annoyed me for a while.Bose's case is much largerSony has better battery lifeWith Sony, The person on the other side of the call hears me betterBut then, thinking about the comfort and the ""hands over ear"" effect, I went with Bose.",True,Color: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],10.0,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,24860.0,4205.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 229.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds

They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck.

4.0,Decent for the price when on sale,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZTC75NUZSKYY?ASIN=B096SV8SJG,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2023",2023-12-25,United States,,"Well let’s start off with I bought these on sale for around $80.If I would’ve paid the full amount of 150 I’m not going to lie and say I wouldn’t have been disappointed.Apple bought out beats audio a few years back so I expected more. The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they aren’t too compatible with Siri. I’m a delivery driver so I can’t always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they won’t read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesn’t always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. That’s the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall they’re decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they don’t fit right.Another thing I might add is that they’re a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale they’re worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I would’ve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, it’s nice that the case charges them. There’s also no way to see the battery levels of the case unless you have an iPhone and open the case near it.

4.0,Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNDGVPHO1V4I5?ASIN=B096SV8SJG,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023",2023-12-27,United States,,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.",True,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,[],4.0,B096SV8SJG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B096SV8SJG&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,10677.0,1246.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 79.63, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 99.95, 'currency': '$'}}",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds

I use it mostly to listen to music and podcasts while I work on chores. Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on 😆.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.",True,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dyuMq4eYL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vpsl3BIzL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7103N5iiFcL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P7Ze4EW+L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71W7ey7KY1L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eARDFNDhL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71l1aW9ktZL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71msSZjGK1L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pJiJTfhEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sPKC-CSPL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yQu2wX-XL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818moZ7d3zL._SY88.jpg']",5.0,B096SV8SJG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B096SV8SJG&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,10677.0,1246.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 79.63, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 99.95, 'currency': '$'}}",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds

The only serious gripe i have is the right bud absolutely kills my ear, even switching to the smallest size it still kills my ear. Now I've only had them for a few days so this could be break in or even user error when it comes to putting them in but using the smallest option and still causing discomfort right out of the box is still something to consider.

The case is relatively tiny and slim so it's easy to carry around in your pocket. However, when it comes to sound quality, these earbuds fall flat. The bass packs a very weak punch. If I didn't get them on sale, I would have been fairly disappointed. One positive of these earbuds is the noise canceling. I use these when I go to the gym, and I never hear anyone, it's great.

Switching from AirPods there are 2 main areas where the Beats Studio Buds could be improved.  Noise cancellation is foremost.  When I flew with my AirPods, the moment I put them in the engine noise and other ambient noises (kids crying, etc.) was shut out.  With the BSB I had to keep checking to make sure they were set to Noise Cancellation mode because there is no difference when they are in or not.  Same is true when I am listening to my music at the gym.  If the music at the gym is loud, I really have to turn the Beats up.  The second issue is that it took a while to figure out how the buds fit in my ears.  Once in, they are comfortable, but putting them in and taking them out can be a little tricky as they are slippery.

I read that other than a few subtle features, the beats studio buds were similar in all respects to the airpod pros and notably $100 cheaper.After trying them for a few hours, the differences are notable.1. It's surprisingly unintuitive how to put them in your ear. This sounds silly (and will likely be solved over time), but they just aren't as ergonomic as the airpods.2. Because the fit is weird (even after trying the various tip sizes), I found myself constantly trying to adjust them, which caused me to inadvertently hit the button on the bud. Given the low surface area on the bud, I can see this being a constant issue.3. They kind of hurt my ears after a while. To the point I found myself actually not wanting to wear them. Never had this issue with extended wear with airpods.4. More of a nit, but the case is slightly bigger, but feels a lot cheaper. Also, it took a minute to figure out how to put the buds back into the case. Again, something that will be solved over time as I use it more, but speaks to the lack of design that you come to expect from apple products (yes, I know Beats existed before Apple acquired them).That said, pairing with iphone was seamless (as expected), and I didn't notice a stark difference in sound quality (mostly listened to audiobooks so far).Overall, I wish I could just return these.",True,Color: Moon GrayStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,[],1.0,B096SV8SJG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B096SV8SJG&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,5805.0,1498.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 79.63, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 99.95, 'currency': '$'}}",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds

Battery life is advertised as “up to 8 hours of listening time”. I have yet to get that many hours - or even close to - of listening time. The most I’ve gotten is 4 hours, and that’s not with continuous listening. I don’t know whether this is a short coming of the headphones, or whether Amazon sent me a “used” headphone that they sold as new. Either way it would be bad since it would amount to misleading advertising from either Beats or Amazon. Or maybe I received a “lemon”. Unfortunately, the return window has passed so I have to keep them. I own a pair of Beats Fit Pro as well, so I have a close “relative” to do a comparison (I get on average approx 6-7 hrs. of listening time from the Fit Pro). The Studio Buds are not premium headphones, but generally you get what you would expect from Beats - pretty good bass, noise cancellation and overall sound, just not as good as the Beats Fit Pro. One of the main reasons I purchased the Buds is because they don’t have the “wingtips” (the little tips that help secure the headphone in your ear). On the Fit Pro they sometimes bother me.  On the Studio Buds, once I found the correct fitting eartips (it comes with 3 sizes), I got a good comfortable fit with no worries of the headphones falling out even while working out.

I went with some Beats buds - these and a pair of Beats Fit Pro. The Fit Pros had some better features but I wasn’t sure about the fit and the price, as the Studio Buds had a better look to me, a better price point, and looked as comfortable as my previous AirPods Pro. Figured I’d try them both and report back. My notes on the Studio Buds below:The good:Feel: the Studio Buds sort of twist into the ear canal, and surprisingly stay in place pretty well. I used the smallest of the three supplied ends and they still stayed in better than my AirPods Pro ever used to. I had them in for over an hour straight with no discomfort.Case: the oval case was secure and the buds locked in tight with the internal magnet. The smaller case fit into my pocket well.Look: the color options stood out. Honestly, the red color of these made me want to keep them over my grey Beats Fit Pros. There’s something about “Beats” and that red color.The bad:The sound: I mean that’s what we’re here for, right? I take teleconference calls with these and that’s fine, but if I play music - especially something bass heavy - and the difference between something like this and the Fit Pros comes in. It doesn’t sound that bad on its own, but carrying the Beats name and a three figure list price you expect something more.Noise cancellation: again, this is a case of “it’s fine, but you expect more.” This doesn’t reach the ability that the Fit Pros or AirPod Pros did. Maybe I’m asking too much for something not labeled “pros,” but again - for the price, you expect more.Battery charge: these seemed to drain pretty fast. Even with limited usage I was down to 70% before lunch if I wasn’t putting them into the case to charge during any downtime.VERDICT:Like I said in the title - I wanted to like these, I really did. But I really can’t justify paying full retail price for these. They’re an Apple product so they pair with iPhones and other iOS devices pretty easily, but they lack the H1 chip so they lack certain features that AirPods and other Beats earbuds have. If you’re spending this much, you might as well spend a little more and get the Fits Pro or AirPods Pro and get better quality. If you don’t need the high end sound quality, look for something from a third party like Anker for half the price.",True,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,[],6.0,B096SV8SJG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B096SV8SJG&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,5805.0,1498.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 79.63, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 99.95, 'currency': '$'}}",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds
3.0,Good headphones for a discount,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QAUICK0CSBNY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096SV8SJG,17 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2022",2022-01-31,United States,,"Honestly, I really wanted to like these earbuds. I purchased these for a 30$ discount but just missed the 40$ discount. Unfortunately, I ended up returning them as they just didn't cut it.1. SoundI was really underwhelmed with the sound of these earbuds. Upon receiving them, I immediately wanted to see what the sounded like. To my surprise, the sounded shallow, and not immersive at all. I have a pair of fake air pod pros and even they sounded better than these. Now, I'm not one to require an insane amount of base, but this was ridiculous, these earbuds had horrible sounding low base. It relied too much on higher frequency sounds. This make the sound seem like it was coming through a filter or like you were listening through a wall. This is especially disappointing as Beats are supposed to be catered to base-junkies. I was also surprised when I found out that these earbuds cannot get very loud. I don't think these earbuds ever touched 90 decibels for me. Even though I try not to listen to music too loud, I would like the option to turn up my music for a little bit.2. FitOverall the fit was ok. The instructions to properly insert the earbuds were a bit difficult to adjust to but I got the hang of it eventually as once they are in your ear, you are supposed to twist them down into your ear. The issue with this was that after a period of time, the earbud would untwist on their own requiring you to readjust them. This also happens if you make any kind of face movement aside from talking or eating such as smiling. This might not be a problem except the noise control ability of the earbud is completely dependent on the seal it has on your ear. This is easily disrupted when it moves out of place. Aside from that, the earbuds did not fall out of my ears easily.3. Noise controlOne of the aspects of these earbuds I was excited for was the noise control. According to some reviews, it was just shy of Air pod pro level. Especially since I got it for 120$ less than half the price of airpod pros, I was excited to see their noise control ability. I was again disappointed. As mentioned above, the seal of the earbuds on your ear is easily broken therefore making noise control pretty much useless. Aside from that, it does a pretty decent job at blocking out VOICES when there is music playing at a medium volume. BUT it does NOT block out low frequency sounds well such as that of a car engine.4. Appearance/caseThese earbuds look decent enough, if you dislike having stems like from air pods you will like these. They are pretty discrete but not as discrete as the beats fit pro. The ends of the earbuds still come out a little bit of your ears. The case is slightly larger than that of the air pods pros and slightly thicker. It has a matte  finish as opposed to the glossy finish of the air pods. I actually prefer the matte finish but that is my preference. One gripe I have is the fact that you are provided with a charger but it is usb-c to usb-c as well as being about 2 inches in length. Aside from the ridiculously short length, not having a cable have a usb side is extremely annoying.Summary:If you can get these earbuds for a discounted price, they are an absolute steal, for being only very slightly more expensive than regular airpods, they are a big step up. For 150$ I really don't think they are worth it. I decided to return mine and pay the extra 50$ for the Beat fit pros.",True,Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,[],7.0,B096SV8SJG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B096SV8SJG&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,5805.0,1498.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 79.63, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 99.95, 'currency': '$'}}",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds

In the end though, I would have rather paid more for this product and have it include the H1 chip. To be clear, it does integrate better than any old set of bluetooth headphones, but nowhere nearly as good as AirPods(or even devices like the beats flex which use the older W1 chip).Sound quality, which is probably most people's biggest concern, is good. Better than AirPods Pro in my opinion, not by a mile or anything but I prefer the sound of these over AirPods Pro. These are clearly better sounding than the regular, 2nd generation AirPods from 2019. They do sound a little more bass-y than Apple's normal sound, but it's not the older signature of beats where they used to use too much bass.The active noise cancellation features are halfway there, the ANC is almost as good as AirPods Pro. The problem is the ambient mode where it lets in sounds from the outside. This is one of the worst implementations I have ever heard. I don't know how Apple could do so well with this feature on their own headphones and do so poorly on the Studio Buds, but they did. I basically have to take them out if I need to listen to someone talking to me or be aware of my surroundings. No two ways about it, this feature is terrible. I think it's because there are no vents like AirPods have, and they just weren't able to replicate the sound using only the microphones. I think it probably also is due to the Mediatek chip (MT2821-A) that this product is using, their bluetooth chips probably aren't on the same level as Apple or Qualcomm (you would think they would have used Qualcomm over Mediatek).The AirPods like features of these headphones are sometimes almost as good as the H1, other times, the only way you can get the little popup card on screen is if you hold down the pairing button in the case. Switching between devices is not seamless at all, even ones that you have previously connected to. I oftentimes found myself having to select ""forget device"" in the bluetooth settings and then re pair these earbuds. The only thing they are really good at is using them with just one smartphone or tablet and not trying to jump back and forth between devices. They work pretty much like AirPods if you were just using them with your iPhone and nothing else.Pros+Good sound qualityCancels out a decent amount of the ambient noise using ANCGood value for what you getBuild quality is good for $150 (especially when they are on sale)Cons-No automatic play/pause detectionThe transparency mode is just not good, like AT ALLEven for the features that are supposed to work well, the lack of an H1 chip is a huge bummer for Apple usersNo wireless charging on the caseSwitching between devices, even manually, is a frustrating process that doesn't work as it should",True,Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,[],10.0,B096SV8SJG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B096SV8SJG&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,5805.0,1498.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 79.63, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 99.95, 'currency': '$'}}",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds

I am an avid music listener of all genres, and believe I know good balance, bass, highs and lows, and overall sharpness when it comes to trying out headphones.  I am not a consumer goods professional, but certainly a worthwhile critic.  When it comes to headphones and wireless earbuds, I have bought and used a number of brands from skullcandy, jaybird, bose, and of course apple.  That being said, here is my review:Noise quality: 3/5 - I was expecting a bigger ""punch"" being that the brand (even though its now owned by apple) was developed by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Lovine, and geared towards the rap and hip hop industries.  The bass and overall output of these headphones is quite indistinguishable.  There is no ""wow"" factor.ANC/Transparency mode: 2/5 - The ANC mode is BARELY noticeable.  If Apple's airpod pros were given a 8 on a scale of 1-10 in the quality of this feature (10 being superior), these would rate a 2 or 3.  My only reaction upon receiving and using these headphones and this feature is ""Seriously?"" Absolutely piss poor and a genuinely deceiving selling point.  It simply is not a feature.Comfort: Out of 5 starts, I'd give there a 3.7-4.  They fit snug and are comfortable for long periods of wear.  Without a stem like the airpods pro, they are less noticeable in your ear.  Sweat resistant, sure.  But by no means superior.  A cheap pair of skull candy headphones seem to stay in the ear better when sweating.  One drip, and they will slip.  However I will say that the sound quality is not as affected as some other competitor headphones when exposed to sweat.Functionality: 2/5 - Who is the genius that decided to make the front of the earbud the source of the controls?  It is the only exposed surface of the earbud.  If the earbud is slipping out of your ear, you cannot simply push it back in as this generates a ""tap"" and will pause/stop music.  Most annoyingly this will end a call.  It is ever more frustrating if lying down with your earbuds in.  Again, any pressure on the face of the earbud (the only exposed surface), will generate a tap.  This feature needs to be GREATLY re-engineered!  A big, hard slap on the back of the head to the six figure paid design team.When I bought these headphones on prime day, I paid $100.  I took the risk of trying something different, hoping for a good competitor to the airpod pros I was using at the time.  I am quite disappointed.  I would not recommend these to anyone, and would encourage consumers to buyer cheaper headphones, or spend the extra $70 for the airpod pros or beat fits pro.SEVERLY DISAPPPOINTED IN YOU apple,  beats,  and the designers and engineers of these headphones.

Undeniably, they offer a comfortable fit and deliver impressive audio quality. However, one significant drawback is their inability to be used individually, as they obstruct a portion of your hearing, leading to disorientation. Initially, I believed they might be better suited for travel purposes, yet the noise cancellation feature proved to be inadequate. Even while utilizing the noise cancellation during a recent trip, I could still hear the engine noise and other ambient sounds. I attempted to test the transparency mode alongside the noise cancellation and found minimal to no discernible difference, except for a subtle hissing noise when in transparency mode. Regrettably, I have decided against keeping these earbuds as they fail to meet expectations, despite being slightly superior to some alternatives.

2.0,An awful experience with my iphone,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KFAVURP3X3XB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096SV8SJG,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2023",2023-05-25,United States,,"Good lord where do I begin. First off the way they fit in your ear is just bad, they fall out within 5 minutes of use even when sitting still not doing anything, if you want these to stay in your ear you HAVE to buy silicone guards that have an ear hook. Second off the software integration with iPhone is terrible, 90% of the time when I pull the earbud out to listen to something it just won’t connect, you have to manually go into Bluetooth and connect it and even then sometimes it won’t connect. Half the time it won’t give you an actual cue or noise that the battery is going to die, it’ll just randomly die without any noise or anything making you think the video just stopped. Speaking of low battery holy crap these headphones have the most annoying use of low battery banners when using the your iPhone with these. You’ll be watching a video and every 2 seconds a banner covering the top portion of your screen will come up showing “% of battery left” from 19% to when they die. And when you look at the battery percentage in settings it constantly switches from 100% to whatever the actual percentage it is over and over causing the banners to pop up which gets very annoying if you want to see what other notifications you have and then you can’t even pull the banner bar down because it blocks your ability too. Also another note on battery life, these headphones only last a max of 4 hours per bud on medium volume without using any pass through or noise cancelling. My AirPod pros would last almost all day but these just have awful battery life for the price. And the sound quality isn’t amazing, it’s passable but nothing incredible. Even if they do use the same drivers and speakers from the AirPod pros, the pros sounded wayyy better than these.In my opinion, don’t buy these. They’re a waste of money, a very infuriating experience and just uncomfortable in your ear even with covers with ear hooks.

They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features  I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally",True,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jPut6+1qL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71M3NbgKTkL._SY88.jpg']",1.0,B096SV8SJG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B096SV8SJG&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,56204.0,3768.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 79.63, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 99.95, 'currency': '$'}}",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds
5.0,Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUUJJA0TERA67/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096SV8SJG,"1,755 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2022",2022-08-11,United States,,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite.  Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.",True,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,[],2.0,B096SV8SJG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B096SV8SJG&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,56204.0,3768.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 79.63, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 99.95, 'currency': '$'}}",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds
5.0,The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGTK8PYYGJ2FG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096SV8SJG,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023",2023-12-31,United States,,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.",True,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,[],3.0,B096SV8SJG,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B096SV8SJG?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B096SV8SJG&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,56204.0,3768.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 79.63, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 99.95, 'currency': '$'}}",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds

1.0,Definitely not worth the money.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M8QP1MGCLS1J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096SV8SJG,130 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021",2021-12-21,United States,,"Not sure how or why these have such great reviews.The only positive thing I have to say is that I appreciate how quiet these can get (almost whisper quiet), which is quite nice. Unfortunately, if you are listening to something with a very quiet recording, you can only barely get these loud enough to hear, and then only if you are in a quiet setting and have both earbuds in place. Because of this type of situation, I was able to learn these earbuds can produce a bass tone I did not otherwise notice with normal listening settings, which was neat, but otherwise useless.Unfortunately, these only come with three size earpieces. You would think they would be enough, but they are not. The medium are too big and hard. If I use them for too long my ear begins to hurt. The small are too small and if I use them, the earbuds do not stay in my ear and are constantly falling out. All the earpieces are also short, so none of them really stay in well. I had to use ear pieces from a less expensive brand that came with 6 different sizes (buds that were only 1/5th the price, too).Because of the twisting motion that is required to put these in your ear properly, I almost always accidentally press the play button before I am ready. Also, even with the more comfortable earpieces I use from another brand, because of the weird footprint these earbuds have, they still do not stay in place well. Also, when repositioning to make sure they don't fall out, I almost always pause what I am listening to by accident. VERY FRUSTRATING.Only while using the better earpieces from the significantly less expensive brand will these buds stay in place while running, but it sounds like someone is playing a bass drum inside my ear everytime my foot hits the ground (PAINFULLY UNCOMFORTABLE). This does not happen with any of the less expensive brands I have owned.There is no standby mode with these, so as soon as the earbuds are out of the charger the battery drain time starts ticking and you only get 8 hours or less when fully charged regardless of whether you are listening to anything or not and regardless of whether you are using the noise canceling or transparency modes or not.The noise canceling function is really not any better with it on or off. The transparency mode is a neat idea, but when there is no sound and nothing is playing it sounds as if you are standing in a wind tunnel (noisy and uncomfortable to listen to). Not worth the loss of battery life to use either function.There is a Beats app you can install. Other than being able to see what mode your earbuds are in, there is really no benefit to installing it though. I had to uninstall it because it was malfunctioning and causing my earbuds to randomly and repeatedly switch into transparency mode (SUPER ANNOYING).The only way to see how much charge is left on the docking station is to check your phone while the lid is open. I don't like that I have to look at my phone to see how much charge the docking station has left instead of having a built in meter like many other brands.There is no effective way to tell if your buds are seated correctly in the docking station and are actually charging.Major buyer's regret after purchasing these.

No matter what nib size I used, they all had to be pushed in nonstop. Which, of course, then would constantly turn off and on the noise cancelling. Just got annoying.-Second, every time I connected them to my PC, it would essentially freeze the computer. I thought that maybe it was my computer, so I even went through and updated all of the bluetooth drivers. Nothing fixed it. NO OTHER HEADPHONES I have EVER had have done this before.-Third, they would randomly pause and skip songs. Halfway through one, then bam, a song is played a few songs down in my library. Ridiculous! Again, I did consider that it was my phone. But no. Fully updated, and this has never ever happened before using these headphones.-Fourth, the mic quality isn't necessarily bad, just weird. It would pick up on the most random sounds, even moreso than my actual voice. No idea why. Nothing fixed this either.-Fifth, the bass was TERRIBLE. I got these to replace my 1st gen airpods from many years ago, but to make music sound even bearable I had to go in to EQ on settings and make it bass boosted. For 150$ that is NOT something I should have to do.-Sixth, I went to use them at the gym, and while they did stay in my ears, it was only by a thread. I had to constantly push them in no matter what size I used, especially after sweating. Not to mention any exercises laying down. They would just fall right out.So, not only were these headphones some of the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn, but they felt flimsy and cheap, the bass was terrible, and they broke basically everything I connected it to. I would absolutely NOT recommend these. Literally buy any other headphones. It was ridiculous how much I tried looking past because they are ""beats."" Terrible. Genuinely.

I bought these as a gift to myself and i thought i was getting a good brand. I was in denial about how bad they were until i had to go back to using a cheap Walmart pair i bought before these. The Walmart pair was so much better then these and i think i spent 20$ on them. These beats earbuds never stay in my ears, the one job they have is to be earbuds and they won’t stay in. I’ve tried all different size rubber pieces and they wont stay. I had to buy the curled earbud pieces, they curl around/into your ear to hold them in there. But because those are the only ones that work you have to put them in a secondary case and carry them with the headphones because you can’t put the earbuds back into there case with those type of rubber pieces on them. Then when i reached out the customer service they told me it was the actual case causing the problems. So i bought a new case. Didn’t fix anything, and just wasted my money. The battery doesn’t last more then 2 hours. Even if your music shuts off or something and you just keep the headphones in until you get a chance to take them out. They will still die, within 2 hrs, even with nothing playing and the noise cancelling feature off. Honestly don’t even think about using the noise canceling feature, your headphones will die in 30-40 min guaranteed. So not only do you buy the headphones but be prepared to buy rubber pieces to actually keep them in your ear and be sure your available to put them back in the charging case every 1.5-2 hours no matter what.

It is noise cancelling, HOWEVER, the mic is actually noise enhancing somehow, so people can never hear me when I'm using them, my husband has a similar pair and being with him on the phone while he's just moving around or doing very minimal activities is headache inducing because of how much they enhance the background noise. I can't even walk by a bag of chips while being on the phone because the person on the other end of the line might pierce their ear drums!2. The app is useless! Does nothing for the background noise situation.3. They aren't consistent, they disconnect and reconnect and disconnect and reconnect, for no reason, doesn't matter what device they are connected to.4. The sound quality is OKAY, just okay, definitely not worth $150. I've had $50 skull candy earbuds that sounded the same.5. The battery life used to be okay, but now 11 months later. Its horrible, I have to charge it multiple times a day, and the battery life it reflects on my phone isn't always accurate, so I definitely thought they gave up on me a few times because it didn't show that the battery was low but they weren't working.6. They are always falling out, its annoying but honestly its not the biggest gripe I have with them!7. They break up, whenever I'm talking to someone or listening to something I just kind of hear it skipping, so if I'm face timing someone I can see their lips moving and sometimes can't hear them, again this is over multiple devices so its not a connection issue or a phone issue its an earbud issue. It does the same thing with videos as well. So it gives me raging migraines if I'm using them for too long.In conclusion: I 've been annoyed by these earbuds for 11 months now, they felt like a bad purchase the second I bought them and I should have just returned them right then and there, but lesson learned!

Unfortunately, they sound thin and airy. Usually Beats have pretty decent bass but these lack them almost completely. Even using bass boosted audio and an equalizer, the bass only just comes through. They come with an extremely short power cable that can really only be hooked up to a computer and they take a couple hours to charge. They claim that 5 minutes of charge will last for an hour but that couldn’t be further from the truth. If you charge them for 15 minutes, you’ll get 30 minutes of listening at the most. Additionally, the charger charges slow and unevenly, causing the two earbuds to have different charges at any given time; which makes it so one earbud works great but the other sounds even worse or just doesn’t work. Pairing it to my phone is a nightmare. Even though I have the latest updates on my phone, they take a couple minutes to pair, don’t pair at all, or will randomly connect and/or disconnect at random times throughout the day. These also come with three different sizes of earpieces to fit your ear but no matter which size I choose, the shape of the earbud isn’t great and even after following fitting and placement directions, still chafe and dig into the the sides of my ears which hurt after about 10 minutes of use. The only thing going for these headphones is the active noise cancellation, which I will admit, is pretty nice when it works. Unfortunately, about a third of the time I turn active noise cancelling on, they instead play a very shrill and high pitched noise which won’t stop until you turn them off. As I said earlier, for being a name brand like Beats and charging $100 for these earbuds, it’s really disappointing to see such a poorly thought out and executed product like these. Especially considering I can get a pair of off-brand, 20-30sec dollar earbuds that will perform better. In short- don’t waste your money on these.

Where do I even begin with these.My family was a early adopted of the first Beats products when they were initially released, but at the time, having tried them out, I could not for the life of me stand how much the bass was boosted in them.

You would think spending a lot of money on the native headphones to your iPhone would mean a perfect experience. These things disconnect constantly. The issue seems to be when playing a game. When playing media like YouTube or Spotify, that counts as “media”, like you have play/pause controls in your notifications for it. When playing a game, it’s as if the AirPods decide after a bit of time that nothing is playing so they just cut themselves off. This is so mind numbingly frustrating when trying to play something like streaming Xbox or playing something from their own Apple Arcade. This definitely was not an issue with my Anker Soundcore Life P3 headphones. You can google this issue and find it being reported as far back as at least January 2023.

1.0,Worst Bluetooth device I've ever used.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UR2MB6BH4R43?ASIN=B0CHWRXH8B,20 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023",2023-11-07,United States,,"Good luck keeping them connected. I won't rate their sound quality or noise cancellation, since both are irrelevant if the device can't stay connected.  I can't watch Youtube or Amazon Prime videos on my Samsung tv. The Airpods can work fine--temporarily. But then no sound at all during and after any ad on Youtube, and usually no sound at all if you're watching a series on Prime or Hulu or Netflix and one episode ends and another begins, or if you simply choose to watch something else. You have to back out to settings and disconnect and then reconnect the Airpods. And even that doesn't always work the first few times. I've tried all the fixes discoverable online--updating firmware, the iPhone OS, etc. The one step that seemed to help is making sure all other Bluetooth devices are off or sufficiently far away. I have three other Bluetooth headsets.  None of them fail under the same conditions, they simply connect and stay connected until I'm done with them, and none require that other devices be turned off or exiled. If you can connect the Airpods, though, and are happy to watch only one episode of a series or one movie at a time, they can work as they should, as long as you don't try to reverse or forward the video. Apple's help is less than mediocre; I'd even say it's contemptuous of its customers. They'll have an alleged expert weigh in on an issue if several hundred people report it, but in my experience their suggested fixes seldom work, and that same response sits there forever as new users report on its uselessness.",True,Style: USB-CSet: Without AppleCare+,[],3.0,B0CHWRXH8B,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CHWRXH8B?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0CHWRXH8B&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,264.0,142.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 173.88, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 189, 'currency': '$'}}",AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds

5.0,Really really really good.***Update***,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PQX3FG6BD7WJ?ASIN=B0CHWRXH8B,811 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2023",2023-10-25,United States,,"I am a rare duck in the tech space as I really don't have a preference between Android and iOS. I have traditionally carried an Android phone and used Apple tablets and laptops. I just honestly find Samsung's innovation in hardware more intriguing. That said, I recently bought a new iPhone 15 Pro for a second phone to leave in my house and saw these new Airpods on sale, so I scooped them. The move to USBC convinced me I need to try both. I have used darn near every credible earbud that has come to market in the last four years. Sony, Bose, B&W, Anker, Apple, Beats, Sennheiser, and many others. I have been chasing the perfect set. I think I found them here or, at the very least, found the closest thing there is to perfection. Here are my thoughts on the new Airpods Pro2:Sound: This is the one area that they don't win hands down, but they sound great. Many of my buds feature larger more well tuned drivers. Some even have dual drivers. Many have the option to upscale to more lossless sound by using AptX. None of that is here, but what Apple has done with sound is commendable. There is good separation between the highs, mids, and lows. Unlike previous Airpods, these things bring a very solid low end that can rumble a bit. I am not an audiophile, but these sound really good. I still think that the new Sony buds and Sennheiser buds are better but it isn't a landslide. Apple has nailed it with active noise cancelling here as well. While the Bose Quiet Comfort buds are still the GOAT for me, these are at least as good as the runner up from Sony. These block out all but the most sudden noises. Really good all around.Call quality: These are easily the best there is for calls. It really isn't close. They do an unbelievable job of masking background noise so folks on the other end can hear you. I was on a call with a friend who was using them as well and his son was in the background gaming. He was yelling at the game and, occasionally when he spoke, I could pick up on it a bit, but only when he spoke. The processing here is just so good.Form Factor: I hate stem style buds generally, but these are solid. They are light and have real balance in the ear. I think because the Pro's have silicone tips they just work better for me. The squeeze functionality makes these so accurate to use when compared to others that rely on tapping and the swipe volume control is really outstanding. For my ears, and this is subjective for sure, these are all day comfortable. You get a solid IP54 water and dust resistance, so these will hold up well in the gym.Battery Life: These are average in this space when compared with their peers. I am getting about five hours on bud. You get another three to four charges from the case. Many others are better here, but I find battery life to be perfectly acceptable for everyday use.Intangibles: There are almost too many things to mention here. First, the case is, as always, the best in the business. It is tiny, solid, packs a great battery, and has the most satisfying magnetic click when closing. I love the spatial audio. It is gimmicky but really fun when it is executed properly during a show or movie. The speech detection is amazing. As is the easy pairing and use on the iPhone. Find my buds is the BOMB. There is so much more that I will update later. These are very well thought out.Conclusion: For me, Apple has crushed it here. Having FINALLY moved to USBC (even if it took the EU to force them) makes all Apple things so much better. These buds might not be the best at much, but they are very good at everything. I can honestly say that these are the best buds on the market. Will I use others for different occasions? Yes, but I doubt that as long as I have an iPhone, I will use many of them often. Buy these now with complete and total confidence. Wow Apple, just wow! Well done!***Update*** So, I am three weeks in with these and I have a couple of other thoughts I should add. First, the thing that jumps off the page to me is the speaker built into the case. I have owned dozens of buds and this is a first to me. It is awesome. The case chimes when the buds are properly returned to the case. You get a low battery notification and it is also used to “find my AirPods.” It is simply brilliant and an example of how thoughtful some of Apple’s designs are. The case is simply next level and that means more than most people think since you interact with it regularly. The other thing that stands out is how much customization there is and how intuitive it is to set up in your settings. Sony offers similar customization and, in some ways more, but it takes a lot more work. Like I said, there are better options for a lot of things, but the polish and attention to detail here from Apple make these a clear winner overall. If you are on the fence, don’t be. I will update with anything else but these are easily the best all around buds on the market.

They connect so easy to any apple products  from Mac, iPad, & iPhone.  Would recommend to any that have apple eco system!!I wanted to update on these now that I used it for close to two weeks & I swear the sound is getting better & better!!  The NC is incredible but with the spatial sound on made the bass little less bassy.  The transparency mode is top notch as if I didn't have these buds in, just incredible.

I feel like whenever I put these in they're not going to stay in but I worked out with these.  I did cardios & weight lifting, ran outside & they did stay in my ears.  Now that I updated my phone there's adaptive sound for these buds which controls the surrounding sound in where ever I'm at.

But I bought my first pair in 2019 and have never looked back. I thought they would pretty much be the same but they are actually better in a lot of ways!The main advantage of AirPods is that they work so seamlessly with other Apple products. So if you don't have an iPhone, I probably wouldn't recommend these. I love how sleek and compact they are because it makes it so easy to carry them with me everywhere. I personally bought an iPhone 15 Pro this year and I HATED that my old AirPods were the only device that I had that used lightning instead of USB C. So I was able to finally get rid of that lightning charger with these new AirPods.The new AirPods pro also have MUCH BETTER battery life, sound quality, and noise cancellation from the old ones. I don't have to charge them nearly as much and they sound even better than they used to!They're great for listening to music and taking phone calls (though I sometimes have some friends and family complaining about my call audio when using AirPods.) Being able to have a convenient hands free experience is really important to me.In the box, you have multiple tip sizes for the AirPods, so if they don't fit well, make sure you try the other tips before returning. I also like that they added a spot to attach a lanyard. I personally am fine with putting them in my pocket, but I know a lot of people could benefit from that.Here are some cons/things to think about when buying AirPods:-Buy the AppleCare+ - so worth it. I put mine through the washer once and they replaced the whole set for $30. I also had a battery issue with my old ones once and it was free to replace the case. Basically if you damage them, you pay $30 and if there's no damage, there's no deductible. The Apple Store employee told me that I would have had to pay $90 for ONE PIECE if I didn't have AppleCare so totally worth it!-If you hate seeing scratches on the white case (not covered by AppleCare) then I would really recommend getting some kind of case. Probably won't do much to protect them, but at least it will keep them looking brand new.-If you have an older phone that uses lightning, you might want to think about finding one of the older kinds that has the lightning case. I HATED having to use multiple chargers so if you're like me, then you might want to try to buy those instead...

5.0,Adaptive noise cancelling is INCREDIBLE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HPEKHIFQA8H8?ASIN=B0CHWRXH8B,10 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023",2023-12-01,United States,,"I grabbed the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro on sale a few weeks ago to upgrade my 1st Gen pair specifically for the increased noise cancelling performance enabled by the H2 chip. True to Apple's claims, ANC is more effective and connectivity/switching between my Apple devices is way more reliable than 1st Gen. Here's a quick rundown of the advantages:- Adaptive mode responds quickly to tune out noise and pass through things like speaking- Better noise cancelling and clearer Transparency mode- Faster/more reliable connecting/switchingSome nice to have things:- USB-C charging <3- MagSafe charging + works with Apple Watch charger- Speakers built into case for FindMy pingsFor most people, this isn't worth the upgrade if you already have 1st Gen (but I HIGHLY recommend upgrading from non-Pro models if you can afford it), but here is why I did it:I've been going to a lot of loud concerts for years, and that has caused some damage to my hearing because I foolishly did not wear proper ear protection for too long. I am now *highly* invested in protecting hearing from further damage, and I've spent plenty of time researching and testing some of the best specialty ear plugs on the market.When the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro came out, I immediately started researching whether ANC can actually protect your ears from exceptionally loud environments like concerts, given the incredible sampling rate enabled by the newer H2 chips. I found several reputable sources that confirmed they work for concerts specifically, so I immediately upgraded my 1st Gen set to test at a show in November.Let me tell you--wow. First of all, well-fitted AirPods Pro block out a ton of sound when they are off. With ANC, outside noise reduction is unbelievable. But the real magic happened when I turned on Adaptive mode. It was like turning the volume down on the entire show to a safe volume without sacrificing sound quality much at all. Only at the absolute loudest volumes—particularly when the bass spiked—did the AirPods noticeably clip from time to time as they tried to quickly adjust to extreme changes in noise levels, but never problematically so.",True,Style: USB-CSet: Without AppleCare+,[],7.0,B0CHWRXH8B,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0CHWRXH8B?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0CHWRXH8B&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,5396.0,748.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 173.88, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 189, 'currency': '$'}}",AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds

Sure, they made hearing phone conversations easier in noisy environments, but I rarely talked on my phone when in public spaces, because, yeah, that felt presumptuous too.Then I switched to an iPad Pro-Magic Keyboard combo from a Windows laptop as my primary work device, which convinced me to migrate from Android to an iPhone, so investing in AirPods just made sense, given Apple’s matchless ecosystem integration.Now, when a call comes in via my iPhone, while I’m working and listening to music on the iPad, I can answer the call from the iPad through the same AirPods with zero effort. I just tap and talk as if the iPhone were in my hand. And I can hear the caller even better with the AirPods than with other buds. Plus, the AirPods’ ANC doesn’t cause the mild sense of pressure the others did.But that’s not all. The AirPods’ transparency mode is so scary good, I can hear every external sound — especially voices! — better with than without them, and that’s why I’m now tempted to wear them in public and have had to revise my previously negative opinion of others who do.Oh, and the spatial audio feature? I expected that to be a gimmick, but it’s accurate yet subtle, and having tried it, I no longer use the AirPods without it.Bottom line: If you see me out and about with AirPods in my ears, I’m not trying to drown you out. I’m trying to hear you better amid whatever cacophony surrounds us. And as with the iPad, having experienced the AirPods Pro 2, there’s no going back.I’m not an audiophile, so I can’t rate that aspect of the AirPods. I can only report that the base, mids, and highs sound as crisp and clear as through anything else I’ve used. I listen to recordings now that I first experienced in the ‘50s and ‘60s, and I hear elements I couldn’t know existed back in the days of AM radios with mono speakers. The AirPods have been a revelation in that sense, too.As for fit, I travel by bicycle and now wear the AirPods to better hear turn-by-turn directions (for safety, I keep them in transparency mode when on the bike), but however actively I’m pedaling, I haven’t felt at risk of the AirPods falling out of my ears. Plus, they’re comfortable enough that I can wear them the full ~six hours I pedal each day when traveling.What would I change? Well, they’re white, and in my perfect world, they’d be the color of darker skin, so the fact that I’m now a guy who wears AirPods in public wouldn’t be so obvious. Tan, brown, or black would be nice options.

These are every bit of the quality and high standard that's expected with Apple products (and the premium price to go with it).I needed some kind of hands free earbuds or bluetooth device for Teams and phone calls, and tried all kinds of things, spent over $200 with Jabra and got something that had a complicated app, poor running time, and ultimately was terrible for calls, picking up a lot of noise especially wind noise when outside. Then I bought 2 different Bluetooth headsets from Plantronics and couldn't find anything approaching an actual good level of quality, even after spending upwards of $100.Syncing the Airpods to my iPad tablet, Windows computer, and Samsung smartphone worked great and was easy. It also seems to do well at ""sensing"" what device I'm trying to use, if I put the earbuds in while joining a teams call or phone call it usually is already connected without needing to do a lot of switching in the device. Finally, active noise cancelling is a huge benefit. I fly a lot and don't know what I'd do without noise cancelling on a plane.Finally, the downsides: First, the Find Me software is useless. These are supposed to have Airtags built in, for both the case and the airpods themselves, but it doesn't seem to work, and it's a well known problem, with several pages of threads on Apple's support forums. I've tried resetting absolutely everything and my iPad won't see the airpods on the list, even if it's connected to them via bluetooth and they're right next to it. So beware of that, if you're expecting their AirTag service to find these when you lose them - it won't. Fortunately you can buy replacement parts, aftermarket cases are as low as $35, and Apple sells individual buds for about $80 each.Second and it goes along with the first problem, but the case lid is ""flappy"" for a lack of a better word.

Tight punchy transients, superb imaging placement exceeding my expectations for wireless devices.

Most non-extreme typical content like voices and acoustic instruments is produced with striking detailed clarity. Some types of content such as compression envelopes that can easily distinguish real amps from sims or detailed textures of granular synths seem to benefit from the smaller transducer placed next to your brain’s audio-to-informational-magical converters.Regrettably I have to give only 4 stars and possibly three overall because you’ll need to buy after-market accessories such as over the ear hooks or tighter fitting tips to secure these within your ear enough to use during active outdoor activities.

The ambient noise of the tool is tool much to handle, it is still loud. I’ve found in that type of tool situation, I just some ear muffs to give me a bit more protection.Here’s the warning. Do not run tools on transparency mode, it magnifies the sound in the ear and it hurts. Adaptive is good if you are slowly easing into tool use.

5.0,The best true wireless earphones for everyone,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11XKM5NH30ZUQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YL76VSR,214 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2022",2022-05-22,United States,,"The Sony Linkbuds S are a shrunk-down, improved version of the already excellent WF-1000XM4. I wasn't expecting this. Given the ""Linkbuds"" moniker I was expecting them to prioritize ambient sound features over all else, just like the original Linkbuds, but that simply isn't the case here.Build: the Linkbuds S are impossibly small compared to the WF-1000XM4, Sony's previous noise canceling earphones. They actually resemble the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 in overall size and shape. They also sport a nice large touch sensitive area that no one should have trouble missing. The only gripe I do have is that the outer surface is textured and this can cause some discomfort if it rubs against the crus helix.Case: the case is definitely one of the more pocketable out there. It's about the same size as the Airpods Pro case, but slightly shorter and narrower, albeit a bit thicker. However, it also has a textured surface which can make it a little difficult to slide in and out of pockets.Fit: the Linkbuds S fit very similar to the Galaxy Buds 2 and deeper than the WF-1000XM4. They are a little fiddly to fit. In my case I have to rotate them back and forth to get them to seat correctly. Although Sony instructs users to rotate the buds backwards to get a good fit I actually found this uncomfortable because the buds would rub against my Crus Helix and cause discomfort. Rotating them forward slightly fixed the issue. Once the buds were in place I found the fit to be secure and that, combined with their light weight, meant that it was easy to forget they were there. My one complaint about the fit is that the buds are so small that it's very difficult to insert them without either accidentally hitting the touch area or rubbing a finger against the noise canceling microphone, resulting in some static noise.Noise canceling: the noise canceling on the Linkbuds S is fantastic. Although the Linkbuds S are advertised as being open I actually found them to be more isolating than the WF-1000XM4s without noise canceling on. With noise canceling on I actually found the Linkbuds S to be slightly superior to the WF-1000XM4 in terms of blocking out background noise and they certainly blow the Galaxy Buds Pro/2 out of the water. I haven't had chance to test the Linkbuds S with very low frequency sounds (e.g. public transport, planes) but for blocking out office and household noise they're the best true wireless earphones I've tried.Sound: I saved the best to last. I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality of the Linkbuds S. The WF-1000XM4s were a big disappointment in this regard, with an overly dark presentation for my taste that led to recessed mids and lackluster treble. The Linkbuds S by comparison adopt a Harman-like tuning that presents mids and treble brilliantly with a satisfying bass boost that doesn't dominate the overall sound. The Linkbuds S definitely beat the WF-1000XM4s for overall sound and they're up there with the Galaxy Buds Pro/2, which are the reigning champs. Comparing the Galaxy Buds side by side with the Linkbuds S I honestly can't pick a favorite amongst the three, which I think is a very good thing.Other: in my limited tests the transparency features are great, as with the WF-1000XM4s. The only other thing that I think is worth noting is that the Linkbuds S struggle to maintain LDAC connectivity more than the WF-1000XM4s. This isn't surprising, given the small size, but is worth considering for anyone who wants to use LDAC in challenging environments or on the go.Wrap up: previously if I wanted to recommend a pair of true wireless earphones for someone I would have to include a 'but'. The Airpods Pro have great noise canceling but the sound isn't top tier and they don't play well with Android devices. The Galaxy Buds sound fantastic but the noise canceling isn't great and they don't play well with iOS. The WF-1000XM4s have top tier noise canceling and work well with both iOS and Android devices, but their sound isn't the best. The Linkbuds S on the other hand have top tier noise canceling, work excellent with both iOS and Android, and have excellent sound. These are now my default recommendation to anyone looking for new True Wireless earphones.Alternative picks: If it wasn't for the better Bluetooth connectivity of the WF-1000XM4s and the improved battery life the Linkbuds S would have made the XM4s redundant. Whether the increased price is worth it for those things will be up to the individual. I think there's still a case to be made for getting the cheaper Galaxy buds over the Linkbuds S if noise canceling isn't a priority. However, I think the only reason to pay more for the Airpods Pro would be if you really like the design and/or the enhanced integration with iOS is really important.",True,Color: Black,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TtFkp9qOL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713GenO1mbL._SY88.jpg']",1.0,B09YL76VSR,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09YL76VSR?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09YL76VSR&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,2453.0,450.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 87.36, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 198, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds S

2.0,"Great in theory, but doesn’t hold up",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VW718GF8F6PX?ASIN=B09YL76VSR,28 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023",2023-02-22,United States,,"Edit to fix my grammarLong review. TLDR: ANC doesn’t work efficiently with constant wind noises blowing in left ear. Transparency sounds whiny, tinny, and almost unuseable. Shotty BT connection. Lack luster app. Sound is good, but only after tweaking the EQ. Switched back to my AirPod gen 1s. Pretty disappointed.So I’ve been using the AirPods 1st gen for about 5 years now. They have always been good, done me right, but they have been crapping out so I decided to look around for new ear buds.I did plenty research and everything came back to these. The price seemed right for what was being advertised. I got them, out of the box was cool, I knew it needed some tweaking, but not too bad. The Transparency was a bit whiny and tinny, but not unbearable. The sound was great, nice bass and what not but I did mess with the EQ a bit then got a nice sound. Audio enhancing, the ear forming schtick, all that fun stuff. This was the first day.The second day was when they were gonna be fully used, as I have my earbuds in almost all day at work, switching between listening to music/podcast, to just pausing the sound and forgetting they are there.Everything was cool, I was digging the transparency and having the podcast on at the same time, the ANC was satisfying. I was able to have a backpack leaf blower on and barely hear it. Of course, ANC was on, and I had my music near full blast. I didn’t do much physical activity that day, so they stayed in my ears well. After a while, I didnt notice them.But then comes the 2nd day. I’m getting ready for work, getting them on, and I notice the left ears transparency was far more intense than the right. The right felt normal, but the left felt like there was someone constantly blowing air into the mic. It was pretty jarring, but it was easily able to drown out in the music/podcast- with transparency on. But with the ANC setting on, it was near mind rattling.The ANC seemed like it didn’t do what it’s suppose to, like the Transparency mode was still active, but only in the left ear. The right felt as it was suppose to, but the left seemed to have no difference between ANC and Transparency.Only when I turned the ANC setting off, and just relied on the seal from the buds themself for the noise cancelling, that wind sound went away. This was the trouble shoot solution that SONY THEMSELVES recommended. Basically saying “just don’t use the ANC feature that you paid to get”Sure, easy fix, but the transparency still started to go, on top of the whiny and tinny sound. Which, the 2nd day, it was almost unusable as the voices came through way too intense and loud, with too much white noise being picked up.This day as well, I was doing some landscaping and was a bit more labor intensive but nothing crazy. These things would not stay in. I’d shove them in, get a solid seal, and then gradually they would fall out. I’ll give it the fact that I was making some hard movments as I was digging in dirt, but even later in the day, simple walking was making them want to fall out. I kept it going, giving them the benefit of the doubt maybe I need to change sizes, all that.I’m driving home, and decide to keep them both in so I can really break in the sound. But as I was driving, I kept having stuttering and quick disconnects. With my phone on my lap, the case in my pocket, I was getting real bad BT connection. Maybe it was the change of internet signals or whatever, if that’s even a factor. I ended up taking them out and using my car stereo because of how bad it got bad.Day 3 rolls around, and all the same issues. Constant heavy wind sound blowing through my left ear, which then eventually switched to the right. Same issues not staying in my ear, I changed buds and smalls were too small, and the large were too large. I suck it up, and keep using them for the day. Trying to mess with the settings and see what I can do. Nothing much able to change.Then My phone starts dying so I decide to plug it in, and keep it off my person, only about 20ft at most away from me at any time, and these things were stuttering and losing connection so bad. I was still within such close proximity to my phone and the case, outside of a building, no walls or anything to impede the connection, and I couldn’t get more then 10-15ft without connection problems. That was very frustrating. I should be able to have my phone within a more reasonable distance to keep a solid connection.I did go into the settings and re-prioritized the Connection Quality over Sound Quality, and that seemed to have made it even worst. This was after a full day of being generally uncomfortable wearing these.The app for these seemed really dated. I understand a BT headphone app not being super crazy innovative, but this one seemed hyped up with unnoticeable change. The added features such as the spatial audio, ear forming, auto voice detection, we’re all very lack luster.I was very excited to try these out and get something other than AirPods, but even after doing extensive research on Wireless Earbuds and came to these conclusions, I am very disappointed. If I’m paying a decent amount on ear buds that have all the bells and whistles, i want the bells and whistles. I didn’t buy ANC, Transparency, in-depth ear buds, to not even be able to use those features because they are just overall uncomfortable to use.I already issued a return, and went back to my old gen 1 AirPods. I am more than likely go for the AirPod Pro 2.This could all be subjective and personal issues with my specific device, but even with that, that calls for mad inconsistency and I’m over all very disappointed that after all my research, it came down to this.",True,Color: Black,[],1.0,B09YL76VSR,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09YL76VSR?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09YL76VSR&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,185.0,124.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 87.36, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 198, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds S
2.0,They were the best of buds.  They were the worst of buds.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RVAS25KM959D?ASIN=B09YL76VSR,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022",2022-12-07,United States,,"In a word, these are inconsistent.  Okay-ish on android.  Intolerable on Windows 11.  Bad for calls.  Save money and buy more basic buds or another brand.Pros:- When they work, they sound quite good.- Very light weight- Pretty good fit for my small and assymetric ears.  Have had one fall out when washing my face, but have stayed in otherwise, though I haven't tried running with them.- Decent for biking when I have a stocking cap over them (not too much wind noise).- Good customer support.  I used the chat feature on the sony site.  They stepped me through a reset (classic, I know), and it fixed a 'tinny' sound issue I was having on windows.- Ambient noise feature is sorta cool.  It's sorta the opposite of noise cancelling and passes sound from the environment through.  This is nice on a bike or when you're around people you might want to hear.  Terrible for calls though.Cons:- Regardless of NC/AN settings in app, these pipe through ambient noise during calls.  I talked to customer service and this is by design.  (face palm).  The result is any noise in the environment is on only piped through to your ears, but actually amplified, making calls very hard if there are medium or high level noises around.  Also, those you are talking to hear it all as well.  I pretty much always have to mute myself when I'm not talking during calls, which is obnoxious for one on one calls.- inconsistency #1: windows 11 sound quality ranges from normal to extra tinny.  Anecdote.  Was watching youtube with them on my laptop.  Sound quality was good for 30 mins, then there was a blip, and they sounded extra tinny.  I put them back in the case, took them back out.  Still tinny.  I re-installed the app on my phone to see if I could change a setting that would fix it.  Factory Reset.  No dice.- Noise cancelling doesn't really work for dynamic sound or loud environments.  Tried using it in a cafe where they were using a mixer.  Made my head want to explode.  The app also doesn't tell you what mode you're in, so I actually just feel like I'm guess if I'm in ANC mode or ambient mode or normal mode.  I've never owned anc headphones, so not sure if this is normal, but in anc mode, it feels like my ears are pressurized.  Which, hell, they might be?!  Using sound to fight sound (destructive interference), as ANC does, it plausibly increases the pressure between the buds and your ear drum.  Not sure.- Also, ANC on windows 11 seems to be constantly toggling on/off every 10 - 40 seconds.  Really, really obnoxious.- The app for android is quite complicated as it has to allow the management of many, many features.  Sony might be biting off more than they can chew here... I would find it a challenge to enumerate the number of features they attempted to implement with these... I think it might introduce more issues than it solves.

I often have to open the app and choose connect.  That should not be required.  Once paired and removed from the charging case they should connect automatically.-the earbuds often lose connection while listening/using them-at times the Speak to Chat would not resume playback after no voices for the specified period of time-now the speak to chat isn't even working at all.- there are no distinct sounds or voices telling you what mode you are in so you are left guessing at their standard chimeWhat's good:- great size and weight, the case with earbuds in them is also very light- small case- good feature set, in theory (however, my experience has been that they are very buggy and do not work reliably)They do not have wireless charging, however, I knew that going in, so I'm not counting it as a negative.  The case feels very cheap, but not where I'd be concerned it'd break under normal usage.  The packaging was great and very small and not very wasteful.Overall, the issues are not worth dealing with or spending the extra money for.

I bought these 6 months ago.  I no long use them unless my other branded buds are dead.  I leave them in my gym bag Incase I forget to charge my other ones or leave them at home.  That's about it, they make a good emergency pair.  They fall out of my ears when working out all the time.  But the biggest problem is the disconnect all the time. My other buds are dead so 8ve been using them for the past hour hand have had to reconnect twice.  They just stop being connected and I have to turn off Bluetooth and turn it back on.  It happens so often themat they are just unuassable.  Honestly wish I could have my money back.🤷These buds are awesome. I bought foam ear tips to replace the rubber ones that came with the buds.  Once I had these on the buds became dangerous. You can't hear anything except what your listening to.  I put on noise cancelation and mowed my lawn with the volume half way up and could hear the podcast perfectly.  There is a function to let in ambient noise if your out in public which is awesome and works great. Battery life is great. Size is great. Fits in my ear and looks really good. The only issue is if you want to use Google or amazon assistant (maybe Siri, don't know, I use android) you then can not use the left earbud on it's own. But in the setting, turn the functionally to handset only and then you can use either bud independently.  I had to contact Sony to figure this out. I don't use Google/Amazon assistant so it doesn't bother me.  I've used airpods for years and hate the stem and the fact that they are white.  These look so good, you can sleep with them in.

Fine.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OGZA9EQA78TK?ASIN=B09YL76VSR,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2023",2023-12-23,United States,,"These new mid-grade earbuds from Sony get fantastic pro reviews.  Source after source states that they compete favorably with the WF-1000XM4 / 5, but at half the price or less.  And so, I tried them out to replace my 1000XM4s.I tried them for one day.Positive thoughts:They are light -- very light!  As a result, they were comfortable to wear, which I can't say about the bigger 1000-series line (even the new XM5s).  The battery life seemed to be amazing.  I wore them for many hours, and was still around 90% when I was finished.Negative thoughts:The sound quality and ANC is a definite step below the 1000-series.  They did an amazing job inside my living room -- the music sounded rich, and the world was dead calm.  But once I got them out on my nighttime walk, I found the ANC very weak in the mid-range -- passing cars were barely muted.  Higher frequency ambient noise (a sound-walled freeway I come within 1/8 mile of) was almost negligibly different on ""Noise Cancelling"" mode versus ""Ambient Sound 20"".  That's ... clearly not working right.I kept hearing this buzz that accompanied voices in my audio lesson, coming from my left earpiece.  It was distracting, so I switched to music.  Then the buds starting skipping, cutting out, and producing scratchy interference.  It got worse and worse for 10 minutes before I just turned them off, and walked home in silence.  This was on the latest firmware and software.Verdict:I probably got a malfunctioning unit.  But while these aren't as expensive as the 1000-series, they aren't really a ""budget"" offering in the sector -- quality control is still important.  I was soured, and Amazon's generous return policy allowed me to try other offerings while the holiday sales were still in full swing.Take a chance if you wish.

3.0,Uninpressive...even on sale,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32Q1G43LPWAC5?ASIN=B09YL76VSR,32 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2022",2022-11-30,United States,,"Let me start this by remarking that while I’ve been using Bluetooth earbuds since they came out, I only really have one set that is comparable to the linkbuds S, which is the Sennheiser CX plus buds I got a year ago. It’s a pretty even comparison from price and features (I got them both on sale).If you just care about good sound for music, call clarity, and comfort, then you might just love the Linkbuds S. If you care about features like transparent hearing mode, battery life, noise canceling, or app usability…I’d recommend that you keep looking.Sound: Even after taking pictures of my ears (awkward), testing tips for optimal ear pressure, and all the other things Sony wanted me to do, my CX plus buds out of the box sound better. 360 sound and app optimization was snake oil if you ask me. It is not a huge difference with most music, but I can really tell when listening to podcasts or audiobooks. The CX plus sound like the person is reading to you in a silent room, while the linkbuds sound no different than my 4 year old $30 generic buds. I even tried changing to the comply foam tips I use in all my buds, and while it usually improves things, I couldn’t tell the difference when using the linkbuds.Call Clarity/Singal: A tie here. Both have very clear call clarity on both ends. I had no problems with singals dropping in Bluetooth heavy areas, both had similar range, and I carry my phone in my front pocket and never had drops with either.Comfort/size: The Linkbuds S win this category by a massive margin. They are comfortable and conforming. So much so that this is the only aspect that gave me pause when returning them. This is where the foam tips usually come into play, but the linkbuds were just always comfortable regardless of the tips. MY CX plus buds get very uncomfortable after a couple hours which made me really appreciate the linkbuds in this regard.ANC/Transparency mode: A big nope on both. For Transparency mode, my CX plus buds might have me spoiled, but I love that mode because it sounds natural, but boosted. The linkbuds makes everything sound tinny, like I’m walking around with a really cheap mic in my hands. I don’t really use ANC, but using foam tips seemed to do more than the ANC on the linkbuds, and even with them I could still hear everything around me. In comparison, I don’t use the CX plus ANC because it works so well that I get paranoid about something possibly sneaking up on me.Battery life: Linkbuds S have a laughable battery life. With all the bells and whistles on I got about 2.25 hours, or 4 hours with everything off; both with the volume halfway. CX plus usually give me 6 with ANC on and 8 without at the same volume.APP/Features: Both the Linkbuds S and CX plus have wonky apps. Some stuff with both are a little fiddly. I am sure that’s probably true with most apps the way software is rushed out anymore. Both have things I don’t like. Linkbuds S I can have Transparency/ANC or one feature and off, but not all 3 even through there are open commands (maybe I’m doing something wrong here). The CX plus allows me to do all three. Multipoint is done the same way, but credit goes to the linkbuds here because I can change to different devices without having to have both buds out. The Linkbuds have a feature that, if activated, can pause audio and turn transparency on when you speak…nice, but it also activates when you cough, hum, or clear your throat which I apparently do constantly, so I ended up not liking this feature at all and kept it off.CXplus claim IPX7 to Linkbuds S’s IPX4. I’m not keen on testing either as I like my electronics dry.Linkbuds S have a smaller, more pocket friendly case, CX Plus has a case with more battery. Linkbuds have a slightly rough matte texture, CX Plus is shiny smooth plastic. Both are subjective and will come down to personal preference.I wish I had more buds to compare them to, but I’m cheap, so I don’t. Depending on what you’re after, these might be great for you (when on sale…a total rip at MSRP), but I returned them.

Specifically assigning functions only to one ear bud or the other, requiring both to be mostly functional.

4.0,"Good at everything, but probably not the best option currently",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35IMA9TKB4906/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YL76VSR,327 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2022",2022-05-25,United States,,"(This is a lengthy review, so in case you are short on time I have included a quick Pros/Cons summary at the top.  This gives an idea of my overall opinions, but for more details continue to read on below.)(Note- I will mostly be comparing these to other earbuds that I have used and/or reviewed recently: AirPods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II )THE GOOD:--Comfort/Fit:  So far, these are very comfortable to wear.  They are slightly smaller than some of the other earbuds I've tested, and are up there with Airpods Pro in terms of comfort.  They also feel very secure in the ear, unlike some other brands.  No complaints here with comfort/design.--Mic Quality:  The mic quality of these is excellent.  I tested out with calling friends, and these were either 1st or 2nd best sounding earbuds according to the people I called.  My friend says that these mics are the best out the earbuds we tested in this range.--Multiple Ecosystem Support:  These work well with all ecosystems, whether you are using Apple or Android; and with assistants including Alexa and Google.--Good ANC :  The noise canceling on these is also fantastic.  This technology has come a long way, and sometimes it can be hard to compare ANC, since each company produces earbuds that prioritize blocking out slightly different frequencies.  To me these seem like they are close to the best , but maybe the XM4s and Airpods Pro are SLIGHTLY better, especially the XM4s at low frequency ranges.  The Adaptive Sound Control is a neat feature that can change ambient sound settings based on your location, though I'm not sure how useful this will be in practice.THE BAD:--Overall Sound Comparison:  With the default EQ settings, the overall sound quality actually seems slightly worse than the WF1000XM4s to me.  I also prefer the sound of the Klipsch T5 IIs with most music, and even the Galaxy Pros with some songs; as these LinkBuds S can sometimes sound slightly muffled or dampened in comparison.  Still good quality sound overall, just not as good as some of the other options in this range, and not my favorite with any type of music I tested.--No Wireless Charging:  This seems like a big disappointment for this price range.  I would expect that ALL earbuds that are over $200 should have wireless charging at this point.MORE DETAILS:Here are my thoughts on each category, again mostly comparing to:  Airpods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II.  (I also enlisted the help of a friend of mine that is an Audio Engineer, to give his opinions and to use some of his equipment.)Sound -  These sounded great to me when I first put them in and listened to a variety of music.  I was not disappointed in overall sound quality at all, and if you aren't comparing these to anything else, you will also probably think that they sound great.  It was only after rigorously measuring their output with my friend's mics, and also repeatedly comparing them to all of the other earbuds,  that I was able to notice the slightly muffled sound compared to the other earbuds.  The Airpods Pro, Klipsch T5 II, XM4, and Galaxy Pro all seem slightly more “clear”, with a broader range.  The midrange on the Airpods Pro might be the biggest difference here, and when I switched back and forth between them I felt like I was missing some of those midrange frequencies with the LinkBuds S.  Overall sound range/EQ preferences are of course very subjective and personal, but my friend and I both agree that these are definitively not our favorite in this category.Design/Fit – I like the way that these fit in my ear, and they are right up there at the top with Airpods and Klipsch in terms of being lightweight and comfortable.  For me, the Galaxy Pros were a little to clunky and felt like they might fall out sometimes, but the LinkBuds S fit great while also feeling secure.  The texture of the buds themselves is almost a little scratchy, which took me a little while to get used to, but I think I prefer this texture for touch sensitivity.  For me though, I have always preferred the press-able buttons on the Klipsch T5 IIs over all of these touch sensors, partly because I often wear a headband over the earbuds and a sweaty headband can mess with the touch sensors sometimes.Calls – This is probably the best overall feature of these earbuds.  The microphone quality seemed to be the best out of all the earbuds when testing out on my friend's equipment, and in real-world testing I experienced similar results.  These were either the best sounding, or a close second best when compared to other earbuds when making calls.  These sounded the best in almost every environment, maybe tied for best with Klipsch in noisy/windy environments.Water Resistance - These have the same IPX4 rating as most of the other earbuds, but note that the Galaxy Buds Pro have a superior IPX7 rating, if that matters to you.  So far these have been working great for exercise, but again personally I prefer more headband-friendly designs sometimes.Charging/etc:  These charge at about the same speed as the other earbuds, and have a similar battery life.  The BIG difference is that these don't support wireless charging, which seems odd at this price range.  These come with a short 9 inch usb-A to usb-C cable in the box, no plug/brick.  This is my least favorite in terms of charging options compared to the other earbuds in this price range.OVERALL:  These are solid earbuds that feel great, produce good sound, have good ANC, and have excellent microphones for great call quality.  They do just about everything well, but at this current price I can't say that they are my favorite, or even the best value.  Overall my favorites are probably still the Klipsch T5 IIs, which are currently less expensive than these LinkBuds S earbuds at the time I'm writing this.  My second favorite would either be the Galaxy Pros or the Airpod Pros, both of which are slightly less expensive and produce slightly better sound in my opinion.  The only thing these LinkBuds S are the best at seems to be the mic/call quality, but even then the difference there isn't big enough for me to recommend choosing them overall.  Personally I'm sticking with my Klipsch T5 IIs for regular use, but if you are a diehard Apple user, I would have recommend the Airpods Pro over these LinkBuds S at the current prices.  If these drop in price in the future and are competitively priced with some of the other options, then they might be a good choice; especially if switching back and forth between ecosystems is important to you and you don't mind the lack of wireless charging.",True,Color: Black,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612vlIFGwtL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613ygSZgADL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AN0CqmlEL._SY88.jpg']",1.0,B09YL76VSR,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09YL76VSR?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09YL76VSR&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,654.0,186.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 87.36, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 198, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds S

The sets of tips that accompany them are useful so that you can adjust their sizing.Using them is a breeze. It's obvious what the buttons and gestures do. Pairing them up to my devices was also a simple matter.I'm happy with the sound quality. I listen to both music and audio books, and these offer more than I expected.The noise cancelling is also quite good.

I often have something playing for hours without an issue.These are not prone to slipping out, either of your ears or their case. I've dropped them a few times or knocked them off a table, and they stayed put, and I've never lost one while bending over or moving around.One major complaint: They do not provide any sort of Find My ability. The Apple AirPods do. If you drop one or both earbuds, assuming you've thought ahead and enabled Find My on an Apple device, they'll play a sound so you can locate what you've lost. These do not have this at all. I wish they'd add that feature.

They still cut out periodically. They are also very sensitive when touching them for volume or to pause your music.

Luckily it changes fast in the case, but still wish it was better. Can me improved by changing codec or disabling noise cancellation.* Only supports LDAC for high bitrate. AptX Adaptive is less prone to dropouts and consumes less power to process, and aptX HD, which more of a lateral move, would be good to see too for wider overall support.Other notes:Using a low bitrate codec like AAC really does improve battery life and connection stability over LDAC - I tend to select it in noisy environments when I might not be able to appreciate the subtle improvement anyways.Case is slim, light, and slightly textured, but still a bit slippery.

I tried my husband’s AirPods and 1. They felt like they were going to fall right out of my head and 2. They hurt that little cartilage spot right before the ear canal entrance. Ppl with small ears… you know the spot I’m talking about! Instant pain and pressure spot. So we tried the other brand owned by Apple started by one Dr. Dre. Cool colors, but still hurt my sad little ears. The search continued…So I turned to Amazon, Reddit, Target, Best Buy, pouring over each review section in search of some clues for a review about each bud and their compatibility with small ears. Knowing that Sony is an old standby for most, I just went ahead and added them to the cart along with a Soundcore pair. The package arrived, the Souncore buds with stems hurt even more than the AirPods did. NEXT! The Sony packaging was fairly nice, recycled materials which I appreciated. Once I slipped them in **cue a chorus of Heavenly Host**. At last! A relatively secure earbud that didn’t hurt my ear cartilage! I downloaded the app and paired them to my phone and Peloton with just a tidbit of troubleshooting research. The sound coming through was almost as good as the Beats I tried. Certainly more than adequate bass for the size. The app has an equalizer option but right off the bat is was fairly well balanced for listening to Fred Again.. . Not too tinny at all. The touch commands are also intuitive! Touch the left bud and it changes from noise cancelling to ambient. Touch the right and it plays/pauses the music. I don’t have anything to say about talking on phone calls with them 🤷‍♀️ it’s just not what I need them for. I need them for exercise.Why I reduced a star: I really wish I could give it 4.5 stars honestly, and here’s why:1. The pairing wasn’t exactly intuitive. You have to have one bud in, have the other one in the case, have the case open and long press the case button to get it to pair to secondary devices (such as the Peloton).2. It makes a click when I’m running.3. The case just doesn’t have that satisfying heft that other bud cases have. And the plastic is rough feeling. Does that matter? Absolutely not. But if we’re rating overall experience it’s worth mentioning.So if you have small ears and have yet to find the right pair of true wireless earbuds, do yourself a favor and get these.

1.0,Not for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RINCOH95UGPPV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YL76VSR,14 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023",2023-07-26,United States,,"Starting with the good: these are good looking Ear buds, feel well built. The sound quality is also good, as is the ANC, which works very well. I also really like the touch controls. They work very well, and they can be modified from the Sony Headphones app.Now for the bad:They do not fit my ears very well. I recognize that this is very subjective, but for me, even with the largest tips in place, it feels like the buds are not very secure in my ears, meaning any strong movement of my head would be enough to dislodge them. This feeling is amplified by the fact that depending on how I put them in my ears, they feel more Or less secure. Most earbuds I have owned are designed to be secure when inserted. These.. not so much.The other big thing I don’t like is the app. It does work, for setting the modes (normal, transparency and ANC), as well as EQ settings and you can also set it up to work with Alexa (but not Siri for some reason). But what bothers me is that in order to use it, you have an agree to a lot of tracking and data collection. This is ostensibly to make some features work (like the ability to set profiles for different locations, like work; home, etc.) however, it make me think of his is a thinly veiled way to collect data of your movements. That is not something I care to do, so I declined it. But it is a shame that to unlock all the features of a device, you must consent to be tracked.UPDATE JULY 2023:I have downgraded my review from 3 to 1 stars, because in the short (and I mean really short) time that I have owned them, I find that they keep disconnecting from my phone at oddtimes. Today, for example, I was on a FaceTime call and my buds decided to disconnect halfway through it. Mind you, they were fully charged. This is unacceptable. The earbuds I had before stayed connected the entire time I was using them, not to mention their ANC and battery life was about on par with the Sony’s, but they were half the price of these!Another reason to dislike these: you will NOT get any notifications from Siri on these . The only assistant that will work with them is Alexa. At first it did not seem like such an issue because I usually activate Siri from my phone. But not being able to get actual, verbal notifications from Siri through these earbuds is amazing, considering the price. Again, my old buds did this too. I only replaced them because I lost them And stupidly, I thought these would be an upgrade. Goes to show that price is not always an indicator of quality. It used to be that when you bought something from Sony you knew you were getting a quality . But more and more these days, what you are paying for is the brand name recognition. That’s it.As for me, I think I will keep these for limited uses for the next year or two, and then I will dispose of them like the e-waste that they are. Seriously. Over $150 with taxes for a device to have such glaring omissions and poor quality, when other companies produce much better devices for a lot less?

I've tried to trouble shoot using Sony's product page.The earbuds are cute and fit wellOtherwise, these earbuds are completely useless.1. The earbud touch function on each ear bud is insanely sensitive. The earbuds go/off and from noise cancelling to not noise cancelling if my hair gets near them, if the wind is too strong, and other times when I have no idea what is causing them to go on/off. Basically, if you have hair that goes below your ear, these are unusable. That seems like an obvious design flaw.2. When the ear buds are not set to noise cancelling, and there's a loud noise, they automatically switch to noise cancelling for the duration of the noise. This is annoying as well as dangerous. I use these on public transit in a large city so the bus or the subway is always loud, there are announcements, beeping for door closing, etc. I don't use noise cancelling when walking or on public transit for safety reasons - you need to hear what's going on around you. But these go in/out.3. For reasons I haven't been able to figure out, these sometimes just stop. They still appear connected to my device, and my app is closed and functioning. I cannot use the right ear bud on/off function when this happens. If I put them back in the case and take them back out, they will work again.

If they would let you move controls to the different buds (e.g. volume control is only available on the left, but it could be tap left for down and right for up) then it would be more intuitive.My newest problem is that they will pause my media (spotify, netflix, hulu, and youtube) after 3 seconds. I googled it and was told to reset the headphones. But the problem keeps coming back - 3 times over 2 weeks. And right now they won't play my media at all.

But the S is an inferior product. The battery life is less and most annoying is you can not use the Left bud while charging the Right bud. You have to use the Right bud in order for the Left bud to work. This means I can't extend the battery life of use by alternating the 2 and never run out of battery which is what I had with the WF-C500. I've never once ran out of battery with those after using for 6 months but for the LinkBuds S, it ran out of battery 2 weeks into using it because I could not alternate using the buds so that one is charging up while I'm using the order and therefore never ever run out of battery.Connecting to the Samsung phone is also very slow compared with the C500 and C500 audibly tells you how much battery you have left when you 1st put in your ear. S doesn't have that and just a soft chime to indicates that is connected but C500 also confirms that is it connected audibly. And much more irritating is after having the S buds out of your ear for about 15mins and you want to pick up again where you left off with a video or listening, you can not connect the S to the phone again, you have to physically place the buds back into the case and pull them out again to reconnect to the phone.

4.0,Compromised for a purpose,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PZOS1XBHFQ46/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,51 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2022",2022-03-06,United States,,"Let's get this out of the way: These are not your all-purpose earbuds. I have TMJ issues (jaw joint) that have made it effectively impossible to wear normal headphones while using my computer - like I had for years - without pain, so I use these instead. Normal earbuds closing off the ears for hours at a time is uncomfortable and not great for the ears. My point is, if you do not have a specific reason to need this design, you should not buy them. They are a compromise compared to regular true wireless earbuds costing half as much. With that said, for their intended purpose, these work pretty well.AUDIO:Sound quality is excellent, detailed and well-balanced (as long as they're not pushed too hard... see below on volume). You will not get a lot of bass. You can hear the bass tones, especially if you add some boost, so the dynamic range isn't lost - but it's not going to thump in your ears. I did find that enabling bass boost (in Windows for my use case, or in the phone app for phone use) helped the overall sound balance. Music sounds slightly hollow to my ears without it.I see the popular review about volume - I have not experienced this in my quiet apartment use case. They have plenty of volume even though Windows bass boost cuts the overall volume down. I keep them at 50-60% volume on my computer, and I tested them on my phone (Pixel 6 Pro, for what it's worth) and settled on roughly the same volume. 100% volume is uncomfortably loud, and also noticeably affects quality (at least on PC, I can't recall if it was the same on the phone). If you are trying to use these in a particularly loud environment, they might not work well.BLUETOOTH:I have had no issues with connection quality within a short range (i.e. typical usage range). However, if I walk to my bathroom on the other side of my tiny 1-bed apartment, which places the utility closet (and thus quite a bit of metal) between me and the computer, the connection starts dropping in and out. I have cheaper earbuds that are able to maintain a connection there. Not a big deal, and most people use earbuds with their phone which is on their person, so this is pretty unique to me.They do not have multi-point. While I am not the type of person to field many phone calls, I can see this being annoying for someone who does if they're using them the way I am, on the computer. Teleworkers in particular might consider this a deal-breaker if they take a lot of work calls. As it is, you'd have to pop one earbud out and answer the phone normally, or use speakerphone, rather than the convenience of the earbuds providing both sound from the computer and calls from the phone.These do not support LDAC. With the audio limitations inherent to this design, I suspect it simply wasn't worth enabling - LDAC uses more power.BATTERY:Speaking of power, the battery life on these is... not great, not terrible. To be fair, Sony isn't hiding anything here - look at the battery life ratings between their true wireless options and it is obvious that these are not designed to have a particularly long life. I haven't precisely measured, but I would guess that they are true to their 5+ hour rating.I do wish they lasted longer, but it's not the end of the world. The fast-charge feature makes it so that occasionally taking a short break and sticking them back in their case is sufficient to keep them going effectively indefinitely. If your use case involves really long periods of uninterrupted use, these might not be your jam.FIT / COMFORT:The big one. Fitting these properly is EXTREMELY important. I cannot overstate how much proper fit matters for both sound quality and comfort. Until you learn how to fit them, you cannot just pop them in and go, like traditional earbuds. They will sound bad, be horribly uncomfortable, and/or fall out.I suspect reviews related to extremely poor sound quality (tinniness), falling out, etc., are mostly related to not taking the time to find the correct position and fit ring, minus the rare exceptions for certain people's ears just not working with these. Play around with them, try out different size fit rings, adjust the positioning to find that sweet spot where they're comfortable and the sound isn't tinny. This wasn't something I succeeded in doing on the first day I had them. It took a few days for me to figure it out. But now that I've learned, I *can* just pop them right in (mostly... maybe a tiny bit of fiddling). They are comfortable enough for me to wear for several hours, but I wouldn't say they entirely disappear.FEATURES:I do not use the few music apps that support their 360 audio, nor do I use them for phone calls, nor do I use them where I would need the speak-to-chat pausing or adaptive volume, so I can't speak to any of those features. They're all there though!The phone app has an equalizer, it does equalizer things. As mentioned in the audio quality section, it has a separate bass boost, which I recommend playing around with if you're using them with your phone.There are only two tap functions (double tap and triple tap), which honestly sucks. I don't understand why so many otherwise competent earbud designers refuse to offer more functions. Since I use these with the computer, I rarely need to actually use the tap functions, so it doesn't really matter in my use case. It probably will matter for most people, though.The Wide Area Tap feature is theoretically very cool and responds to taps well. That might sound great, but the problem is that it also false triggers constantly for me. Eating something? Okay, track skipped. Several tracks, actually, because you didn't stop eating. Yawned? Got it, you want to pause your music. I went to the trouble of installing the app and temporarily connecting them to my phone *just* to turn the feature off. It was driving me nuts.VERDICT:See the title. These are compromised by design, but the design exists to accomplish a very specific goal, opening up the ear. If you need that, you should give these a try. If you don't, there is no reason to buy these.",True,Color: Gray,[],1.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,600.0,174.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original

Even when you have them open in air, must have one hand to keep the case steady. Matte material case instead of glossy. Has a nice texture to it like a smooth river rock, but not wet, durable or as heavyUnique design. May look different on different people depending on ear size. Some may have smaller ear canal opening showing more of the ring. A co-worker with smaller ear canal tried it on and someone said she looked like a hipster or those who do ear lob enlargements. If you have larger ear canal it can fit the whole ring inside. Those with large outer ear may show more of the ear transparent silicon ear tips holding earbuds in place. Those with overall small ears, the bump on the earbud can protrude out more--Software features-Adaptive voice volume:volume adjust to outside/background noise. No ANC (active noise cancellation), will defeat the purpose of the earbuds-Speak to chat:Love this feature. When you start talking it will pause the audio and resume again in 15secs if you don’t continue talking. The option may not be good for those who talk to themselves or sing along with music. For the former, may help you build habit to stop. If this is an issue, you can turn it off in the app-Gesture controlsTap side of head instead of earbud itself. Great feature as clicking on earbuds itself can lead to miss alignment. Can double or triple tap either side for audio controls. Able to customize what does what (pause/play, skip forward/back, volume controls, activate google assistant/Amazon Alexa, etc) on the app with two functions on each side. For example, right ear bud can have pause for double tap, skip forwards for triple tap. Left ear bud can have volume down double tap, volume up triple tap.-Quick Charge: Have up to an hour playback time for 10min chargeIf you have 'adaptive voice volume' and 'speak to chat' on it will drop from ~5 hour battery life to around 3.5-4 hours depending on activation--Missing Premium features-No ‘find me’ option.  Cannot locate earbuds if lost, whether its sound or gps.-No wireless charging for case- No multi-point connection. Only able to connect to one device at a time. Must re-sync Bluetooth when using a new deviceOverall, awesome casual set headset when you want to listen to music, podcast while doing other activities.

4.0,Something new! And maybe a limited target audience...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROGVBK5H73K13/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,94 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2022",2022-02-23,United States,,"**UPDATE**: They're really growing on me. I find myself using them more often than my usual pair. After tuning the EQ, they sound quite good, and if I'm gentle, they don't really fall out. So, I updated from 3 to 4 stars.ORIGINAL: I was really excited for these headphones and they are slightly disappointing. Main points being:- They are difficult to put into your ear, even after repeated practice, reducing the convenience factor of having true wireless headphones- They easily fall out for me, regardless of which size retaining ring I put on. More on that later- They have an oddly bright sound, but I don't think they have a poor sound quality at all like many reviewers are saying. More on that later.- Their direct competitors for most use cases are bone conduction headphones, and I think bone conduction is a better choice here.I do appreciate the innovation, and I think it's a really cool concept and I love the novelty. If that's enough for you to own it, then these are good true wireless headphones that sound pretty good and don't cause pressure in your ears. But if you actually want them to be useful for most situations where being aware of your surroundings is important, I think you'd be better served by bone conduction headphones (such as AfterShokz).The rest of this review is just going into more detail about those points, so you can stop if you got the gist.-- Not good for physical or outdoor activities --The question to ask yourself is: why do you WANT open back headphones? If your answer is, like I think most people, ""to hear my surroundings"", then the next question to ask is ""WHEN do I need to do that?"". If it has anything to do with being outside, then you don't want these, go get bone conduction headphones. Those leave your ear completely open and essentially CAN'T fall off your head without significant effort. I think bone conduction is safer and more convenient for outdoor use or exercise. However, if your answer is instead ""because I don't like pressure in my ears"", these might be just what you're looking for... see the ""Great for relaxation"" section.The Linkbuds are very light and just kind of ""sit"" in your ear. You can certainly move your head and they won't fall out, and they didn't even fall out for me when I yawn or move my jaw like others said. If you touch them the wrong way however, they just slide out of your ear. I actually think this is the real reason for the (very cool) ""wide area tap"": see how there's nothing holding the headphone into your ear on the backside? They're only anchored into your ear with two points: the retaining ring at the top and the donut speaker. If you lightly push the headphones forward, with essentially no effort, they pop right out. Most people's ears will have the same problem, because the Tragus (see an ear diagram, it's the pointy bit at the front that the donut speaker wedges behind) locks the front of the donut into place, but in general, the Antitragus (the other side of your ear) isn't a hook, so it's just light friction keeping it in place back there. There's nothing stopping the headphones from pivoting forward, and they DO stick out of your ears, so... something as simple as brushing your hair away could make them fall out. You have to be careful.The other problem is ""hearing your surroundings"". The speaker sits directly over your ear canal and thus partially blocks it, and also makes any incoming sounds fight with the speaker. I find that with these, the sound from the headphones almost always drowns out anything important I'd want to hear around me. I can't even have them super quiet and have a conversation with someone, as the sound from the speakers fights so heavily with incoming sound. But with bone conduction headphones, your ear is completely unobstructed, and I find that incoming sounds mix much better, maybe because the soundwaves don't have to fight in your ear canal. That part could be subjective, but at least for me, bone conduction feels significantly safer, because I can still hear everything around me, even if the surrounding sounds are quiet.-- Great for relaxation though! --That brings me to the title: who is the audience for the Linkbuds? I think it is for specifically people who want true wireless headphones but don't like pressure in their ears and are NOT looking to use these for exercise or outdoor activities. In fact, you can look at the marketing and features to back this up. These are not ""sports"" headphones, and maybe that's not why you're buying them. I keep comparing the Linkbuds to bone conduction headphones, but if you don't intend to use these while doing physical activity, the Linkbuds are honestly better. I find myself using them all the time in bed, because I AM a person who doesn't like pressure in their ears, and you can't exactly use bone conduction headphones while lying down (they have a band that extends behind your head).They also sound WAY better than even the best bone conduction headphones I've tried, which is why I'm surprised people say they sound so bad. I wonder if they've never used open-back headphones before: yes, you don't get nearly as much potential bass as closed-back (and especially in-ear), no matter WHAT the design is. I have Sennheiser HD600's, the ""audiophile mainstay"", and they sound amazing, but they'll never have as much bass as my cheap in-ears (iems). So if you're a bass head, you won't like these at all, you're stuck with closed-back headphones and iems. To me, the Linkbuds do sound oddly bright though, like over-emphasized upper-mids and top. It's not distorted, just a bit of a strange signature to my ears, but using the app, the EQ is saved IN the buds themselves (along with all the other nifty settings), so it's easy to fix. But, I've also found that small adjustments in fit greatly alter the tone of the Linkbuds, so take that into consideration when reading reviews: they might not fit everyone the same and thus they might not always sound that great.All that junk being said, I do actually intend to use them all the time, just for relaxation and essentially nothing else. I don't even trust them for cooking, I'm afraid I'll brush them while moving around and they'll fall into the food. But, I'm still gonna use them until they break. Also, the case is VERY SMALL, and I really like it! The picture attached shows one of those older slow iPhone chargers, and these are even smaller than that and only just about as thick, so it's definitely nicely pocketable. The recycled plastic is a nice, unique touch, and the case feels sturdy enough (definitely nowhere near airpods). The lid locks into place if you pull it open enough, that's kinda cool.The Linkbuds are so cool, and they serve a good niche, and I LIKE them, flaws and all. I gave them 3/5 (edited to 4/5) because I recognize that they have problems and that there are better alternatives for most use cases, and yet I'm still so fond of them. I want them to succeed, even though I don't think they will. I think there's absolutely a group of people for whom these are perfect, and I want these to stick around for those people.",True,Color: Gray,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lAAwuiGhL._SY88.jpg'],3.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,600.0,174.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original
4.0,Uniqueness and Innovation Make These Great,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q22V1MBDQP5O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,93 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2022",2022-02-19,United States,,"These earbuds are amazing!! I have many pairs of wireless earbuds, but these offer a lot of things that others don't. They give amazing sound quality in a pair of open-designed buds, making them a much better option than Airpods or Buds Live. In this review, I'll compare the Linkbuds to those buds, as well as Sony's flagship WF-1000xm4s (which I will refer to as xm4s).SOUND QUALITY: 4.5-Wow. The Linkbuds have an incredibly clean sound that sets them apart from other open-designed earbuds. The mids are clean and the highs are crisp, but something to keep in mind is that the low end is not very prominent. It is more of a bass you can hear rather than feel, which is to be expected for a pair of open-designed earbuds.When compared to other open-designed earbuds like the AirPods and Buds Live, the Linkbuds blow them out of the water. The AirPods and Buds Live have more bass, but when compared to the Linkbuds, it is evident that the mids and highs get completely drowned out as a result of the added bass.-The xm4s and Linkbuds have similar mids and highs, but the low-end on the xm4s is amazing and gives the music a lot more body. That's to be expected from sealed earbuds.-Overall, these are by far the best sounding pair of open-designed earbuds I have ever used. They are the closest sounding buds to open-backed headphones I have tried, and even though they miss some bass, they give the music a really pleasant and natural sound.COMFORT: 5-The Linkbuds are extremely comfortable. They are similar to AirPods and Buds Live in the sense that I can wear them for extended periods of time without my ears hurting, but I do think that I could wear the Linkbuds even a bit longer just because they are extremely lightweight. They even come with 5 different sizes of wingtips. Plus, the hole in the center of the driver really makes you forget you are wearing earbuds! It's pretty amazing.-The xm4s, and in my experience almost every other pair of wireless earbuds with a silicone tip that creates a seal, will never reach the level of comfort given by open-designed earbuds.BATTERY: 4-I was able to get about 5 hours on one charge of the earbud, which is right around Sony's estimated 5.5 hours. That is slightly above average for wireless earbuds and I haven't run into any problems with it yet.CONTROLS: 4.5-The Linkbuds introduce a new type of control where you tap the sides of your head to pause, play, skip, or activate other functions you can set in the app. At first, I was fully expecting this to be a gimmick, but then I noticed myself using it constantly! On top of that, I haven't noticed any issues with false touches, and now I love the feature! I only wish I could set more than 4 different functions.VOLUME: 4-These buds don't get very loud. I don't listen to music very loud so they get plenty loud for me, but if volume is one of your main concerns then all the other buds I have previously mentioned get much louder than you would ever need.SOUND LEAKING: 2-The Linkbuds leak a lot of sound, even compared to AirPods or the Buds Live. This is to be expected since there is a literal hole in the middle of the driver and there is nothing to stop the sound from going out, but just be aware that if you are listening to something above 65% volume, then someone in the same quiet room will probably be able to hear it a bit.PAIRING/CONNECTIVITY: 4.5-For Apple products, you just need to go to your bluetooth settings and click the device to pair them.-For a full Apple ecosystem, the AirPods are a bit easier to connect and reconnect over multiple devices, but not by a large margin. For any other device, these are some of the best options for connectivity. Just press the button on the back of the case and they will enter pairing mode, and for Android users they will pop up and ask if you would like to pair without even going into settings.-I would have liked to see multipoint connection, but it is still a fairly rare feature in earbuds so I can't be too mad. On the bright side, they are easy to reconnect between multiple devices.CASE: 5-The case is adorable! It's a bit thicker than the Airpods case, but still very small and can easily fit in almost any pocket without issues. When you place the buds in the case, they actually click into place, making them feel a lot more secure than a lot of other wireless earbuds.UNIQUENESS: 5-The reason I love the Linkbuds so much is because they do a lot of things that no one has attempted before. The biggest one is the donut-shaped driver. Even when compared to AirPods, Buds Live, and other open-designed earbuds, these stand out as not only the best sounding but also the most natural. When I am having a conversation with someone, I never once felt the need to reach over and take these out of my ear. The hole gives a direct channel from the outside to my ear canal, making these incredible for having a conversation or hearing your surroundings without taking them out.-I also want to acknowledge Sony's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. The buds are made using recycled plastics and rubbers, and the packaging is very minimal and contains no plastics. It is amazing what impact companies can make when they make efforts like these.PRICE: 5-For a pair of earbuds with this much innovation and sound quality, I think $180 is a very fair price.CONCLUSION: 4.5The Linkbuds offer something really special. If you are a huge basshead or want noise-canceling, then I would recommend looking at earbuds with a sealed silicone-tip design. However, if you are looking for a pair of open-designed earbuds like the AirPods or Samsung Buds Live, then I would easily recommend the Linkbuds every time. The comfort, sound quality, and uniqueness set these far apart from all other similar earbuds. When I reach for a pair of open-designed earbuds, the Linkbuds are the ones I grab 99% of the time, and that means a lot.",True,Color: Gray,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61X9yJgX7hL._SY88.jpg'],4.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,600.0,174.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original
4.0,Please Do Your Research!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17PIRQ5I6OW7B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,25 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2022",2022-04-03,United States,,"I love these earbuds! They are my go to for when I want to listen to music, podcasts, or generally anything I don't want to bother anyone else with but still be able to listen for doorbells, or have a conversation with someone.Sound Quality: Remember when we used to have those wired earbuds from Sony or JVC or Panasonic that came with those foam covers that we always used to lose? That's what these sound like, but slightly better - very slightly. Mids and highs are good, don't expect much, if any, bass. There is some low frequency response but it's very airy. These are no audiophile earbuds folks! Only audio codecs available are SBC or AAC. These are akin to Apple's Airpods - they are completely open, no sound sealage, no noise cancellation, but sound quality is definitely not bad if you know what to expect. But if you do get a chance to listen with these it's a different experience. Like music or voices are only playing for you, but you're not completely sealed off from the world. Your own personal soundtrack can play in the background as you go about your day. As mentioned before, the LinkBuds only offer SBC or AAC audio codecs, which is fine. Why waste AptX or LDAC capabilities on open earbuds? You lose more detail with the earbuds designed to be completely open. With the Headphones app you can turn on the function to upscale compressed audio via AI with the DSEE option. I honestly didn't notice any huge difference with it being on or off.Build Quality: ABS material, though they feel very sturdy. The recycled plastic look has its own charm. Definitely a different look and feel, but you can tell Sony really tried to go environmentally conscious with everything, from the materials to the packaging. Besides the silicon inside the buds, it feels like it could be recycled again (if that makes sense). They don't feel cheap by any means. The buds are lightweight, probably some of the lightest I've used. Overall good build.Battery Life: Battery life is good. I would say average. About 4-5 hours of continuous music listening, with an additional 2-3 full charges from the case. Just recently got the Xperia 1 III which they added battery share (reverse Qi charging), which is interesting to me since the case for these earbuds didn't include Qi charging capabilities. Sony s WF flagship does, but these do not. Hopefully if they make a LinkBuds ver. 2 they add it.Fit and Comfort: Just like any new earbuds, getting the fit right requires some trial and error (and sometimes a little bit of discomfort). The LinkBuds come with 4 (I think, can't remember) different sized wings that help keep the earbuds in place. My ears are somewhat smaller, so I typically use either small or medium eartips and wings. For these I had to switch the preinstalled mediums for one size smaller. At first the wings are a bit too stiff and uncomfortable. But after breaking them in they're perfect! The LinkBuds stay in place, even with more than normal head shaking. Although the shape of these earbuds are unorthodox, once you understand how they need to be placed in your ear they fit well. Compared to the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live I find these MUCH more comfortable but a little more pressure than Airpods.Features (Headphones App): The Wide Area Tap apparantly isn't a new function, but it is a niche one. The way it works is instead of tapping directly on the buds themselves, you double or triple tap an area around an earbud for it to trigger an action. In the Headphones app you can assign area taps for each side, but only limited to a specific function. For example, for the left area you can assign the Volume function, so 2x tap will be set to Raise Volume and a 3x tap will Lower Volume. And for the right area you can set something like Playback Function, where 2x tap will Skip Song Forward, 3x tap will Previous Song. You cannot, however, set left area to function as 2x tap volume up 3x tap previous song. It's only left/right area tap set functions (Volume, Playback, Assistant, etc). There is Adaptive Volume Control which raises the volume automatically when you're in a louder area such as outside where there's traffic, and lowers volume when you're in a quieter are such as a library. Then there are your typical earbud functions, such as Auto Power Off when nothing plays through the earbuds after a certain amount of time passes, or Auto Pause when earbuds are removed from your ears. In the app you can mess around with the equalizer, set up 360 audio, set voice to speech, and set voice notifications.Connection: Now this is my biggest gripe with the LinkBuds. I have the Headphones app set to prioritize a good connection at the sacrifice of sound quality, but noticed if there are any large masses that get in between my phone and the earbuds (like, say, my fat body) the earbuds cut out. This especially happens outside, I've noticed, while I'm gardening or washing the car. Sometimes the interference also cuts out audio in the left earbud. And it's not just for a second or two, it could be until I pause my music and try reconnecting the buds, needing to place them back in the case and restarting the connection to my phone. It can be very frustrating at times - hopefully there's a patch coming.Overall, very good first foray into this design by Sony. I hope they continue to refine this line of earbuds. I know their flagships have settings to allow passive audio but normally those sound too robotic - having open audio is more my preference.",True,Color: Gray,[],5.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,600.0,174.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original

I thought because of the different way that these were inserted, they might fit better. They do fit better, and I like them, but here are two things to consider. First, the whole thing about when it hears you start speaking it pauses so you can have a conversation? Well, it can hear you hum, maybe sing-along to a song, maybe the TV is on in the background because someone else is watching it… You get it. So I had to turn that off.  The other thing is the set up. I am not a tech advanced person. I downloaded the app because you have to in most cases, but then it wanted me to download a different app for some 360° audio something or other. If I didn’t download that app, then I couldn’t get to the equalizer or some of the other benefits. so I downloaded the first app on the list. That app, then wanted some ticket number or something that I was supposed to have had bought somewhere. Again, there may be a way around this, or there may be a way around not putting that ticket number in but  I pretty much threw my hands up in the air and just stopped messing with it.

I work remotely and I spend most of my working time by myself, so I needed something comfortable and wireless that I could wear to listen  to music while I work, for hours at a time, while being able to hear the doorbell. I also like to hear my blue-switch keystrokes in the background of the music, gets me into a special zone when I'm typing long documents.Also, I wanted something I could use for remote meetings, since I hate to talk with earbuds or closed back headphones because they give me that ""talking with your ears plugged in"" sensation, and I wanted something wireless that allowed me to get up my chair and pace around or mop the floor while on a meeting that should have been an email.So, comfortable, open back, wireless, for music and meetings.ComfortThey're very comfortable. You won't feel you're wearing them most of the time and you can wear them for  hours at a time without having to take them out just to scratch your ear canal. Spend several hours or days using them with the different fittings to find the one that's best for you. The rotational angle of the earbud seems to affect the sound signature also.ControlsThey detect when you take them out and pause your music which is great. They also detect taps near your ear which is cool but they pick up false triggers from time to time. Also, pick up false touches when you adjust the buds in your ear.Sound QualityThey sound okay. Bass is acceptable for punchy basslines (Rufus Du Sol - Until the Sun Needs to Rise) but non existent for anything under 60hz (Beck - Motorcade). This it's expected given the size of the driver and that there's a hole in the middle of it.The mids are a bit forward which makes them great for phone calls (Adele - Right as Rain: Her voice gets rendered with an almost AM radio / vacuum tubes sound, might be intentional by the sound engineer).Highs are well controlled and not harsh, they're not ribbon-tweeter crisp but they're not piezo-ceramic tweeter harsh either, if anything, more towards the former, which renders pleasant and highs (Samantha James - Satellites: she sings with very pronounced S sounds which render harshly on drivers with uncontrolled highs, which is not the case here).ConnectivityI have a strange issue in which the earbuds keep breaking up every few seconds when I have my phone in my pocket. Other than that, I haven't had any issues. They're easy to pair and they reconnect to my phone and laptop with no problems.Battery LifeIt is unlikely that you will get more than three hours of continuous active use before you have to put them back into their charging case. I use them for a couple of hours and put them back into their charging case for 30 minutes or so.Are they worth it?If you have the same use case as I do and you don't mind the price tag, go for it.

I bought them specifically for using when riding around on my bike (since I need ambient sound awareness when biking around traffic in the city) but I am finding out many other times that are perfect for using these and I gravitate towards them - around the office, when I am out and about walking the dog, when sitting at the airport waiting for my flight to start boarding, etc.  The ability to hear your surroundings is great, and if you pump up the volume you still can drown out most of the ambient noise if you choose to.The sound is great for the use we are talking about - it's a very pleasant sound signature, with clear and supple mids, and the highs rolled back a bit to match the fact that you will get a lower bass depth and punch than if you were using an in-ear with sound isolation. Let's be clear - if you want a set of earbuds that give you a meaty, thumpy bass these will be extremely disappointing. The bass is more or less hinted at, but not really very present - there's enough that the mix is not weird, but if you want that visceral thump of bass that hits in the chest, look elsewhere. But for casual listening while out and about, podcasts, pop, etc. they are really excellent. And like with any other set of headphones, once you start listening for a while and adjust to the sound, your brain fills in the rest. So you won't be missing much for casual listening.The fit takes a couple days to master. There's a tendency when you first get them to want to try to jam the speaker wheel closer to your ear canal to get more volume / bass, but that's not the way these go. Basically, keep the fin vertical at at 12 o'clock position and have them rest in front of the ear canal lightly. Once you get used to the fit, they are extremely comfortable, especially as you will not experience any of the ""ear suck"" common with in-ears.Battery life so far is good - after listening for an hour ad mid-volume I've lost about 12-14%, so that's more than adequate. The box is a bit fiddly, but I appreciate that the buds fit in securely with a noticeable clack, so you know they are charging and secure in their beds. The app works really well, I do recommend turning both Adaptive Volume Control (which dials up the volume to overcome ambient noise) and Wide Area Tap (which allows you to control the buds by tapping in front of the area). I also appreciate that there's a lot of configuration options for each earbuds gestures - I set mine up to control volume with the left bud, and playback with the right one and that works really well. Also, voice calls are excellent I am told.All in all, great little buds, and definitely fantastic for uses where you want to have some awareness of your surroundings...",True,Color: White,[],9.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,600.0,174.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original

Very compact and comfortable.I bought these because I work in an environment where it's a hazard to not be aware of your surroundings and I've very much enjoyed having them. It has a lot of aspects I like about it, but each positive feature comes at a cost and you should weight what you want and need properly before buying these fairly pricey headphones.The case is very small, the smallest I've seen on wireless buds. It fits so well in my pocket, I hardly notice I brought them. This is very neat if, like me, you carry a lot of keys and don't have much pocket space left. The cost of this, however, is that the case itself doesn't hold much charge. It will charge my buds from dying to full one time with roughly 20% charge left in the case.The buds are comfortable, designed specifically for ""all day comfort"" so that you technically don't need to remove them at all through the day. This design was executed well and I really could wear them all day; if only the batteries in the buds themselves lasted longer. I get between 2-4 hours a charge, so at work I charge them during my break. This works out for me, but as mentioned the case doesn't hold much charge either, so if you expect to need them for more than four hour bring a charger.The sound is natural and quality, it almost sounds like I'm listening to a radio while holding a conversation. They have a little trouble with heavy base sounds and get a little wavey, but the natural environment and open air make it sound like you're not just in a studio. I like that but for some that might be more of a flaw than a feature.They connect to multiple devices well. I love playing my steamdeck and getting both my games sound and audio from the video playing on my phone. The drawback here is that the signal for the headphone is the weakest I've experienced. I can't place my phone on a desk and walk to the other side of the wall without losing connection. Sometimes my audio cuts out even when my phone is in my pocket, although I've only experienced this while moving. If little cutouts bother you, these headphones arnt for you.All in all I like them.

2.0,Almost Amazing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12RJ708IWC1SA?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2022",2022-03-03,United States,,"I am the type of person who is alone most of the time and needs to hear my surroundings. I'm not ever in a noisy environment, so noise cancellation isn't necessary for me. On top of that, I can't stand not being able to hear the world around me. It increases my anxiety, and I'm always paranoid when I can't hear.Enter the LinkBudsOn paper, these are the perfect earbuds for me. No better ""passthrough"" audio than literal holes cut in your earbuds. I feel like these earbuds were created with exactly me in mind, so I decided to give them a shot. Unfortunately, almost every good thing brings something bad with it.The unique design will obviously be interesting since there's nothing else like it. I like the creative problem solving for making open earbuds. They include many different sizes of silicone rings so that they can try to fit any ear size... But they definitely will not fit everyone. They just won't. Unfortunately for me, apparently my inner portion of my ear is too small (which is shocking to me because I'm 6 feet tall and have a giant head). The smallest size ring creates a prominent bump on the top that feels like it is stabbing my ear after more than 5 minutes. I also can't remove the ring because they won't stay in without it. I've had to compromise by using a too large size and kind of just cram it in there for extra padding. Not idealThey are designed for all day usage since you can hear your surroundings while wearing them... But they aren't comfortable enough for me to wear them for more than an hour or two. There are no soft parts unlike normal buds, so the hard plastic constantly being crammed in your ear can definitely hurt after a while. Unfortunate.The design gives them more of an ""open back"" feel. Obviously the sound will never be as good as over ear headphones, but honestly, they are very clear and have solid sound quality. I find that most buds don't satisfy my audio quality standards, but these do satisfy me most of the time... But they also have practically no bass. Not a huge problem for my types of music and for podcasts, but I sometimes feel like I'm missing parts of the songs, especially when comparing with Sennheiser open back headphones. If you only listen to bass heavy music, do not buy these. You will hate them. For the average user, I suggest downloading the app and turning on the EQ settings so you can compensate better for the missing bass.The case is compact and the buds snap in securely. It's also made out of recycled plastic which hopefully is a plus for our planet... But the case feels hollow and very slippery. I wish it had a better texture so I wasn't afraid I'd drop it at all times. I wish it had a more premium feel for the price.One note about my ear shape. My ears are odd in that they kind of have a slope to them where the earbud would rest. I have a problem with *every* earbud I have ever used and trying to get them to stay in. Because of that, each ear fits differently with these. The unfortunate side effect is at times the audio can sound slightly different per ear which can make the audio experience unpleasant at times.The final incredibly unfortunate problem that is probably exclusive to me: because of my ear shape, the left bud sits at an angle and actually plugs my ear completely.... Which means the hole literally does nothing for my left ear except when I reposition it to a really specific way, but it always goes back to plugged after a while. I will continue working with it to see if I'm doing something wrong, but I seriously think they just don't work properly with my ears.ConclusionI'm giving this 2/5 stars because the idea is excellent, the sound quality is good (except for the bass), and that these buds are incredibly useful in situations where normal buds wouldn't work.Unfortunately, the execution was not done as well as I hoped. The discomfort I experience in these is incredibly disappointing. I hoped these would be buds I could use almost constantly, but they hurt me too much to do so. And with the left ear problem as listed above, it kind of negates the whole purpose for one of my ears. Just know these are not made to fit everyone, and if you've ever had issues with buds fitting, be cautious with these.I am considering trying to return them because I can't justify the price if they don't work for me 100%. I hope I can find a solution because I want them to work.I think these will be amazing for some people, but I'm honestly devastated I'm not one of them.",True,Color: Gray,[],1.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,351.0,192.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original
2.0,Controls are possibly the worst part.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CLPDLTO9KPYO?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2022",2022-06-24,United States,,"I work out doors in Texas heat. I bought these to replace my Pixel Buds for a couple different reasons. Primarily, I hate having my ears plugged with rubber -- especially when it's hot out. I despise ear wax getting inside the rubber ear rings and even worse, into the speaker grating eventually causing the need for pin-sized cleaning.These seemed perfect on paper. They don't actually insert into the ear canal, they're open backed which allowed me to still hear what was going on around me. In my field, this is important as I'm exposed to the outdoors and have to be on my toes for anything ranging between people and loose dogs.Coming over from the Pixel Buds, I immediately had a distaste for these buds. Where I was always able to simply pick up one bud and put it in my ear, I found that I could only seem to do this with the right. After a bit of deep diving, I found that if you have the assistant feature enabled, then it will not allow you to use the opposite bud by itself until you disable the assistant feature. I merely assumed that it would be able to handle switching priority on the fly line the Pixel Buds did.My next issue was the control lay out. Essentially, where my Pixel Buds had the same controls on either bud at any given time, these are only able to have two controls assigned to each bud. Even if I was to look past this problem, more often than not, it doesn't recognize the double tap / triple tap activations. This is supposed to be enhanced by a sensor that's supposed to detect these taps when done near the sideburn area. How did they find this to be acceptable?Another frustrating feature is that the buds will quiet down drastically depending on what's going on around you. While I initially wanted this to be a good feature, it just wasn't. While it was nice when a customer would approach me to ask me a question while I was outside working -- a lot of the time they would detect something around making noise and lower their volume, which is the opposite of what I want. They're open backed and allow plenty of sound in for me to hear outside of what they're playing, I didn't need them to amplify this because of everyday sounds.I'm beyond sad that I took a chance on these buds only to be this disappointed by something that's just shy of two hundred dollars.There's too many things wrong with these buds that's simply weren't thought out or considered while being developed.I personally had to use one of the smaller bands to get these to sit in my ears correctly and honestly, they were pretty comfortable when they stayed. I say that, because when I would begin to sweat heavily outside in the Texas sun, I found that they would begin to work their way loose and often fall out of my ear.I wanted these to be good, I really did, but I feel they simply fall flat when you aren't wearing both of them together.If you're looking for a set of buds that you can deal with always using both buds at the same time so you have access to all your controls, then these really aren't bad. But for someone who's looking to rotate one in and out of the case as their batteries get low so it can charge the other, these aren't what you're after unless you plan to palm your phone whenever you need to make some kind of adjustment / control change -- or can simply live without your assistant and assign the same controls to both buds.",True,Color: Gray,[],2.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,351.0,192.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original
2.0,Terrible Bluetooth range and connectivity issues,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JEKSF5YVKU13?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,30 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2022",2022-02-18,United States,,"Bought these because of the LTT shortcircuit video FWIW.Phones I've tried them on, Note 9, v60 and pixel 5aMy typical use case for these headphones, is while I'm working on servers as a system administrator or as a mechanic when I am working on cars.I really wanted to like these headphones, I have been a big fan of bone conductor headphones, and this seemed like a great in between. but I'll list my pros and cons down below.Some of the pros, They do sound great for what they are, they lack some bass response which is to be expected with an open back design, but all of the sounds are very crisp and accurate. Max volume isn't the loudest, but again that's not exactly what this headphone was geared towards, I find myself somewhere in the bottom third of my volume and being able to work in an office setting without any issues. Phone calls have been very clear on both sides, and the wide area tap is a cool feature that I really do like. I definitely appreciate the Sci-Fi look, and they are pretty low profile compared to some of the other stuff I have worn. They were a little bit uncomfortable but after swapping out the various sizes of tips, most of the discomfort went away.  The automatic pausing feature for when it detects speech, works pretty well, it doesn't pause a YouTube video, but that could very well just be my phone. It does pause my audiobooks and music with no issue and starts back up after 15 seconds or if I double tap to interact with it.Now for the cons. The biggest issue is my various connectivity issues. First is the range, I have used headphones like the Galaxy buds Plus and never had any issues with them disconnecting or losing sync. I've used the headphones for about 8 hours, and if I am turned a certain way or in an area with lots of signals bouncing around ( office buildings, housing complex, general Life etc) they will frequently cut out, even more annoying is when one of them cuts out, once it start playing after it syncs up, it out of sync. I've had as bad as a 2 second delay on just one of the headphones. I'm pretty sure this was something that they ran into before they released it, because there is a large area for troubleshooting and changing the quality settings for the Bluetooth headphones. Even after going through all the troubleshooting steps, and setting it to the lowest quality, I still get frequent dropouts and the sound is worse now. Maybe there will be a fix on a future firmware, but just walking around with my phone in my pocket, it well inevitably cut out and be disruptive.I have been wearing Aftershockz (now just shockz) bone conductor headphones since their first headphone release, because I need to be aware of my surroundings and typical headphones weren't doing it for me. I have been Daily driving the AfterShockz aeropex (now Shockz openrun) headphones for over a year (had the airs before that), they are not as crisp as these headphones, but they definitely are not bad, plus put some earplugs in, the sound quality improves immensely and blocks out all ambient noise, something these headphones can never do. They definitely aren't as stylish as these headphones, but functionality wise and the fact that they are IP67, has caused me to return these headphones. These do have improvements in sound quality, but with all the drawbacks and connectivity issues, I can't recommend them at this time. Hopefully there is a firmware update that fixes some of the Bluetooth issues.",True,Color: Gray,[],3.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,351.0,192.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original

Sony has managed to let me down time and time again. From sound components to cell phones, everything I've owned from Sony has failed in some way. In the case of these headphones, the worst is:1 - Disconnects and connects when you are in the middle of a call. It only happens when you're on a call. Not if you're listening to music. In a normal chat you can get disconnected at least once.2 - Battery usage is not optimal on both. I explain:I use the cell phone in the left pocket, so it is normal for the right earphone to consume more battery, but the difference between the left and right earphone can be more than 30% in its use of a charge. To try to balance that loss, I removed the gestures from the right earpiece and started carrying my cell phone in my right pocket. The unfavorable difference persists but in normal use it is now 15%.This seems very deficient to me but that it is cut off in the middle of the call is undoubtedly the worst.

Sony se la ha ingeniado para fallarme una y otra vez. Desde componentes de sonido hasta celulares, todo lo que he tenido de sony a falladado de alguna manera. En el caso de estos auriculares, lo peor es:1 - Se deconecta y conecta cuando estás en plena llamada. Solo pasa cuando estás en una llamada. No si estás escuchando música. En una charla normal puede llegar a desconectarse al menos una vez.2 - El uso de la batería no es óptimo en los dos. Me explico:Yo uso el celular en el bolsillo izquierdo por lo que es normal que el auricular derecho consuma mas batería, pero la diferencia entre el auricular izquierdo y derecho puede llegar a ser mas de 30% en su uso de una carga. Para tratar de equilibrar esa pérdida, quité los gestos al auricular derecho y comencé a llevar mi celular en el bolsillo derecho. La diferencia desfaborable persiste pero en un uso normal ahora es de 15%.Esto me parece muy deficiente pero que se corte en plena llamada es sin duda lo peor.

I stopped using them regularly for a couple of weeks (I used to use them for a couple of hours, 3 to 4 times a week during gym training) and when I picked them up again they started presenting this weird issue where the battery of the earbuds was drained completely while they were unused and stored in the case.It became a frequent issue when I started using the earbuds with a lot more frequency again and there were even cases where the case charge level was reported at something about 50%, but the earbuds where drained completely to 1%.I tried the solutions recommended in their website and started keeping track of the issue, but still, the battery of the earbuds was consistently being drained while they were stored in the case (closed).Charging the case with the earbuds inside manages to restore the charge for both the case and the earbuds, only to be drained as soon as the case is disconnected and the earbuds remain unused for some time.I've also seen some reports online of people having the same problem with no clear solution.There's very little help from the technical support and, since I don't live in the United States, I'm forced to take the product to a local official tech support/store which either doesn't respond to my questions or doesn't have the technical skill to check/fix the issue (there's only 2 near where I live).For the price of this product I'm very disappointed and I'm slowly coming to terms with the idea that I won't get any solution to this issue.",True,Color: Gray,[],5.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,351.0,192.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original
2.0,LinkBuds - Still need some work,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFON5QZXJQ2QM?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2022",2022-04-08,United States,,"My use is during exercise outside running, walking, trails.  I have them paired with an Iphone 13 Pro and Series 7 45mm LTE watch.  My music is on the watch so the LinkBuds are used with the watch and phone is left home.  As I exercise outside I prefer the open earbuds and do not use, or want, noise cancelling (I want to hear that speeding car or growling dog coming up behind me).  I really wanted to like these, but I have two big issues.  Fit and comfort is fine no problems that.  Many of the features such as pause while talking I have turned off.  I give a command to my dog or sing a little bit with a song the music would always pause.  The near ear control I had to turn off due to wearing my kinit cap while running would routinely pause the music (still kind of cold here).  The first big issue for me is the other day I was fine tuning the Custom EQ with my music on the phone.  Got the EQ to where I really like it.  Now I just assumed that the EQ profile I made would be transferred to the LinkBuds so when i played music off my watch I would get the same sound from the same music.  Apparently it is device specific, the profile apparently stays on the device it was setup on because after trying 4 times I could never get the same sound from the watch.  Worked well with the phone but not on the watch.  Problem 2 is a bigger one for me.  I have been using wireless earbuds since the early Bluetooth 4.0 days and most people know that typically the right earbud had the antenna so if you wore your device on your left arm or left pocket you would normally get cutouts.  Move the device to the right side and all is good.  So I always wear my watch on left wrist and what I noticed was numerous cutouts coming from the sound.  So double checked Sony's website and left and right earbuds each have an antenna.  Was not sure what was going on at first but I found when I moved the watch to my right wrist the cutouts stopped.  Despite these being Bluetooth 5.2 I believe, I think what is happening when using both earbuds is only the antenna on the right side is active when using both.  This is the only thing that makes sense.  Because every time I use them with the watch on left wrist I have cutouts in music constantly.  Switch the watch to the right wrist the cutouts stop (sound not good due to EQ profile not on the buds).  I have no problems with other buds from Jabra, Jaybird or the new Grell Audio, but I am trying to get away from stuffing things in my ear.

So, in my search for good irritant-free open earbuds, I tried the Sony Linkbuds - for about 15 minutes!.They are small!  I have the Sony WF-1000XM4 and thought these were similar in overall size, since there's some design similarity, but they seem tiny in comparison.  I have very large ears and wingtips never seem to work.  While the largest hoop did manage to hook into my concha, it was not a very solid fit and the buds could move around fairly easily, affecting the sound signature a lot.  Depending upon the angular position in my concha, the Linkbuds were either just OK or somewhat loose.  The hoop is not stiff at all and is only designed to stop the buds falling outwards, not to restrain it rotationally.  IMHO, they are very comfortable to wear because they aren't held in position that securely!  ☹.The donut speaker sat comfortably in my ear, but it was clearly at the wrong angle for any decent bass.  If I pressed firmly on the battery portion, the sound actually was pretty good, with a surprisingly substantial bass presence.  If they sounded that good all the time, I'd have kept them.  However, when I let go and the Linkbuds resumed their natural position in my ears, the sound went tinny and no better than $10 earbuds!  I just couldn't find a fit which gave a full, balanced sound worthy of the hefty price tag... and these are expensive for what they are..My wife and daughter tried them and the Linkbuds seemed to fit their smaller ears much better.  Not sure if they got a good sound as they aren't as audiophilic as me  😉 .  They did say they were fiddly to insert properly, with that hoop, and not worth the hassle..Disappointed, I returned these almost immediately for a refund.  My experience will be for my ears only.  I'm certainly not average when it comes to my ear shape.Each person's ears are unique, even left to right.  You may get a good fit, or you may not!  I'm just warning you that these are not a ""one-size-donut fits all"" set of earbuds, even with the different sizes of hoops, and that donut speaker positioning over the ear canal is critical for the sound.",True,Color: White,[],9.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,351.0,192.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original
2.0,Wait until a new version comes out.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TH3P6WGSO25L?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023",2023-03-22,United States,,"Curb your enthusiasm.They are an open back tws which does allow you to here your environment very well, but music is almost completely lost in moderately noisy environment. Anything under 300 hz is not pleasant and almost missing without giving it a proper EQ. Even after the EQ you’re missing a lot of bass and all of the sub bass. Mids and highs are usable in quiet environments, but there’s nothing to write home about. Soundstage is unique, but how they sit in your ear has an enormous effect on what you hear and where you think you’re hearing it from.The provided wings/tips are under built and tend to lose their shape. I recommend using an over sized tip and dealing with the discomfort until it deforms and puts let’s pressure on your ear. If you use a tip that fits appropriately it will deform and over time the ear buds will fall out very easily, especial if your sweaty or in a humid environment. The part of the bud that enters your ear is also made out of a hard plastic that becomes pretty uncomfortable. If you typically use small earbud tips completely pass on these. Even if you have average sized ears you’ll experience the buds pressing to hard against cartilage.Battery life is pretty poor under normal circumstances, but it gets worse if you’re raising the volume to compensate for the lack of noise isolation. It gets even worse if you’re using the preprogrammed smart commands. The commands are not worth the hit on battery performance and I simply recommend not using them. The commands are frequently unresponsive or over active depending on what firmware update you’re using.The earbuds do frequently unpair from each other. Although they can typically recover pretty quickly it’s enough to mess a call up or have a negative effect on any music listening experience. I’ve found that simply placing your phone in your pocket, across multiple devices, is enough to break the connection.Overall I do not recommend these… at all. If you’re curious about how they sound try them first. I’m expecting that the next generation will have something more to offer than what we got here. After owning them for one year I can confidently say that you’re better off buying something like the the AirPods Pro 2, sennheiser momentum 3, or the moondrop Alice.

3.0,Very niche product with a LOT of trade-offs,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38ETHB01DTXV2?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,141 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2022",2022-11-11,United States,,"The short version of this review is that I think this is a product that will make a very limited set of people happy that are looking for something very specific or don’t care about a lot of the trade-offs that come with making a product like this. It is tough to recommend for a general audience.  For that small group, maybe it is four stars, but for everyone else, I’d say it’s two stars, so three overall.  Let me get into the why…So to start, I’m big into music and headphones, and I own a total of 12 pairs.  Four of those are “consumer” headphones like AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Max, Sennheiser True Wireless 3, and all of the rest are true HiFi headphones like Audeze, Focal, Fostex, Denon, etc. and all of the accompanying amplifiers and DACs.  I generally enjoy lots of different genres of music - rock, alternative, R&B, hip-hop, pop, some classical.  I just point this out, to point out I do a LOT of detailed sound comparisons and appreciate lots of different types of music and how different headphones may impact the experience.So, with these, I think there are only a few specific reasons one should even consider these, as if you don’t fall into BOTH #1 AND at least one of the other reasons below, there are far better options for this price.#1 - you really don’t like the “closed” feeling of buds and want a more “open” sound (and as such don’t care at all about noise isolation - both from outside and others hearing your listen, which is standard for any open setup)#2 - you don’t care about sound quality much but want some wireless buds that are stable enough to do light workouts in or just want some really small/discrete buds#3 - you primarily listen to music like jazz and classicalNow onto the logic and trade-offs.First, with respect to the sound.  The tonal balance is extremely lacking in low end.  The reviews that have said that these are a “balanced sound” are simply wrong.  If you search around the net, you can see some sites have actually measured the frequency response of these, and not only is the bass very rolled off, it creeps up into the lower mids as well.  This results in a very hollow listen.  Music has nearly no low-end impact at all.  Even with every bass setting cranked all the way up, it makes almost no noticeable difference because the drivers and design simply can’t handle it (which I’ll get back to).  Further evidence of this, the EQ in the app only even goes down to 400Hz, which should be a sign, as most wouldn’t even consider it true “bass” until maybe 150Hz, and humans can hear down to 20Hz - yet the EQ doesn’t even let you adjust these frequencies.  To call this balanced is just wrong.  Good balanced headphones simply do not OVER-emphasize bass or let it bleed into the other frequencies - these lack bass, period.  This is a very big difference if you listen to basically any Top 40 type music - hip-hop, pop, R&B, EDM, even rock or alternative.  There will be no bass.  This CAN be ok, however, if you’re a classical music listener or jazz or music that doesn’t have a lot of low-end (including bass drums, bass guitar, etc.).  These would also be OK if you’re primarily going to use them for listening to voice stuff - podcasts, audiobooks, news, etc.The rest of the frequency response is overall just OK.  You can adjust the mids and upper frequencies to your liking, and those adjustments make more of a difference than the bass adjustment, as I mentioned.  So you can tone down or up the brightness to your liking, for example.  They do an OK job at brining out detail, about what I would expect for buds in this price range.  The semi-standout in the overall sound is the soundstage, or the way the music is presented in terms of position in space.  Because of the “open” design, they are somewhat more natural sounding in terms of airiness and don’t have that “dome in your head” kind of feeling.  That said, the stage itself is not hugely bigger than “regular” buds (goes ear to ear, maybe a tad outside the ear), it’s just a slightly more open stage.  Because the buds are still sitting in your ear, versus when an over-ear open headphone has a driver sitting outside your ear, i would call these only semi-open sounding.  The inside your head feeling is gone, but you still don’t get that great open naturalness of a true open-back headphone.  The positioning is also good, meaning, individual pieces of the mix are fairly separated and identifiable, for this price range.  The question is it worth the trade offs…Open back headphones of all types (buds, over-ear, etc.), all else equal, have less bass response than closed-backs.  This is because there’s less pressure build up and resonance for the bass to build (in simple terms).  So the tradeoff for losing that “in your head” feeling is less bass.  Bigger, over ear headphones can counter this by using bigger drivers that can pump more bass and by still creating somewhat of a seal around your ear with the pads.  in this case, these buds just sit in your ear, create no seal, and the drivers are tiny, so you get basically no bass.  This is the biggest trade off of these.  Whether that trade off is for you or not…your call.The other tradeoff is size.  Smaller size leads to smaller drivers, which as I discussed means less bass, and it also means - way small batteries.  Although the “up to” five hours of battery life may be accurate, there are some big issues with this.  First, you have to turn off all of the electronic conveniences to hit this target - automatic voice detection, automatic volume adjustment, wide area tap - which are all pretty cool.  Keep these on, and battery is more like two hours, which is FAR below, by more than half, what most buds get nowadays.Call performance is decent, and fit for me is also decent, though individual ears always vary with fit.  The smallest included piece is what got me the best fit, and they are stable in my ears.What these actually remind me of are the first AirPods that were released, then upgraded to the AirPods Pro.  The original AirPods also had a “sit in your ear” plastic design that was somewhat like this.  While they were wireless and packed with nice new apple “magic” features, many had a view that they really still sounded like the $30 wired buds that came with iPods/iPhones at the time, but they were wireless.  Then Apple released the AirPods Pro that claimed “far better sound”, and the biggest change was that they used a silicon tip to create a seal in the ear - and that added a way more appropriate low-end to the sound that was missing before, and NOW and AirPods Pro and Pro 2 are known as a mostly balanced set of buds.  These are the opposite - by having no seal, combined with tiny drivers, I would say these have the sound profile of a $50 or less pair of buds, but you are paying for the true wireless stuff and fancy features.  They MAY be worth it for you if you don’t mind the trade offs, but that’s not most.",True,Color: Gray,[],1.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,544.0,232.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original

It's honestly for very specific people in mind, I decided to get this for work and for walking around in public; can't get better ambience noise than a friggen hole in the earphone haha! And for those reasons I am quite satisfied with them, if you are an Audiophile you most definitely don't want this as you don't get direct sound or a cushion to keep sound out. Speaking of the sound, I gotta say it is pretty impressive! Clear voices from podcasts and whenever I play heavy bass songs I can hear and feel it, you can always adjust your equalizer using the app.Charges fine and I have been able to successfully talk to people without ever having to take them out of my ear which is why I am satisfied.Con: the tapping feature is high tech for no reason, what was wrong with simply tapping the earphone? In this model you need to tap your cheek or sideburn. You will have a hard time if you eat with these on as it will mistake the noise in your mouth for taps...so infuriating, I wish I could disable it. It has a Pause/play tap:2x, Song Skip tap:3x but I can't figure out how to play the song again or the previous song. Doesn't follow traditional Samsung functions but connects to the app well.

3.0,"Niche but useful, definitely room for improvement",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BGNYYG7EW1IQ?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2022",2022-05-12,United States,,"I'm deaf in one ear and prefer to have some situational awareness when I'm out and about, or even just around the house. I figured the open design of the Linkbuds would allow me to hear the environment while also listening to music and documentaries and they work very well for that specific purpose. I can hear if something is happening around me but the Linkbuds are just loud enough for me to tune that out and focus on the music when I want to. It will pause when I start talking, which is a great feature and relatively consistent when determining between me coughing or actually talking. The wide area tap controls are awesome and feel really futuristic when you're tapping on your head and pausing, skipping tracks or changing volume. I wish that was a little more customizable as they're pinned to certain presets but still a really cool and surprisingly useful feature.I am not a big person so I assumed the small or medium ear pieces would be the correct fit but was surprised when I discovered that I needed the large one. Once you have the proper fit then these are pretty much as stable as earpods and actually tend to get knocked out a lot less since there's not dangling piece to snag on stuff like a facemask. If you've ever tried to remove your shirt with airpods in then you'll know what I'm talking about. This doesn't happen nearly as much with Linkbuds, actually, I can't think of a time when I've knocked them out after I figured out the correct size.I initially was not impressed with the sound quality, which I assumed would happen due to the open design. However, after finding the correct size earpiece for me, I discovered that this had a huge impact on sound quality. When they fit right the sound quality is pretty good and the bass can be heard. Not quite as good as something that plugs the ear but that's understandable. These are perfectly fine for most environments, I've only had a hard time on a busy street but that's why I wanted to open ring design so that's fine with me. I'd read that there is significant sound leaking, again, due to the design. But I found that it's barely above that of earbuds. My GF was a foot away from me in a quiet room and could tell I was listening to something but couldn't make out the words or anything specific about what I was listening to, just that the headphones were on and there was some sound coming out.The biggest weakness so far is the battery life. It's almost exactly 5.5 hours as advertised, which is significantly lower than what I can get with airpods, which last almost my entire work day of 8.5 hours. I do wish the battery life was closer to the airpods but it's not a dealbreaker for me. The charging case is small enough to fit in pockets so even when I'm out I can bring the case along. I do wish the case had QI charging capability but it's also not a dealbreaker.Overall I'm happy with the Linkbuds but think a $120 price point would be a better fit since they are quite a niche. They are surprisingly stable in the ear as long as you have the right fitting piece and the look is nicer than earpods in my opinion but I have a suspicion that the high price point is mostly ""Sony tax"" and is likely to keep most people with normal hearing from considering them. Since higher end earpods have been incorporating a transparency mode to hear the environment better I think the Linkbuds may a fairly limited demographic but for me, as someone with only one functioning ear, they are a great fit for what I need. Also, they stay much cleaner than earpods since they do not actually enter the ear, which is also great for people who easily get ear infections.",True,Color: Gray,[],3.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,544.0,232.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original

I was barely able to force them in anyways. I guess my ears are just too small for these earbuds - as is the case with almost anything I have tried so far.

My ear canal starts feeling like it's sweating/humid inside within less than 1hr of using earphones. And soon after it starts hurting. The external ear also starts hurting if I need to stuff an earbud to keep it in place.So these earbuds with holes let some amount of air circulation in and it took longer before my ears started hurting. They were also very comfortable. I had to choose different ear ""stub"" size for each ear to get the best fit (XL and L).I'm no audiophile, but the headphones were good for audio and phone calls. I never tried ANC (I don't think it has is?). And I liked the fact I could hear the world better. A lot easier to interact with a barista.Saw some demo review YouTube video and these ones seem to have top notch background noise cancelling on calls so that you are easy to hear for the person on the other end of the call. Way better than all the other earbuds reviewed in that video.* Fast pairing is so nice. It's quick to pair.* Super convenient and great battery indication with Android. A notification pops up every time you connect tell you the charge of each bud and the case.* Nice compact caseCons:* Can sometimes misinterpret cheek scratches or random face touches as intentional taps. It tries to have a fancy feature where you can tap near your ear to control the linkbuds, but honestly I'd have preferred buttons or capacitive touch over false positives.* One of the headphones would randomly stop playing audio or be at super low volume. Either moving it or moving my phone would fix it. But it was so random and multiple times per week and was very annoying.* Case is so hard to open without accidentally dropping it. I haven't ever dropped it, but I never feel confident with it. It's because of how curved the whole case is that you can't get a good grip. Single handed case opening is practically out of question.* Manually entering Bluetooth pairing mode is next to impossible. You'll have to press a button with the case lid open, but holding the case in that position without closing the lid is very hard.  It's hard to describe, but it's like trying to press hard on a small sphere while not holding it across the center.* This seems to be a cons for almost every earbuds except the Jabra ones -- no mic mute button!! I'm in work meetings all the time and I can't mute my mic without taking the phone out, unlocking the phone, finding the app I'm using for the call and then muting the mic.The audio disconnects and lack of mic controls were the main reason for returning these.

Obviously these will not isolate sound, they have holes, I have a different pair of Earbuds or IEMs or Headphones if that's all I'm aiming to do. I think these are great if you still want to hear what's going on like in a work setting and such without the jarring feeling of everyone sounding a bit ""off"" when you wear traditional earbuds and hear them through the earbuds mic.That said, I love the idea of these earphones, my only issue with them right now is that they aren't comfortable for long use. Because these aren't normal earbuds. The way they're held together in your ear is by pushing two parts of your ear and that creates problems for me. Regardless of which lobes I use or whatever they're called, the eventuality of pain from these things pushing into my ear (the tragus?) will come and I really hope that Sony makes more of these and improves the design.

3.0,"Unique design, but could use some work",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RYCLGN10E7EK?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2022",2022-10-02,United States,,"For context, the only other pair of wireless earbuds that I own are the Samsung Galaxy Buds+. I was looking for a pair of 'open' earbuds (ones that rest outside of the ear canal) because I dislike the in-your-head feeling while talking or singing with in-ear earbuds.  I also like listening to music while walking or biking, but I have to wear one earbud at a time to be aware of my surroundings. I don't use transparency mode on my wireless earbuds and headphones, since it doesn't sound natural to me. But I think that's a given, since transparency mode reproduces outside sound with microphones. The LinkBuds fit my use case.Pros:- The sound is alright. Due to its design, it won't sound as detailed as in-ear earbuds, or as good as a pair of open-back headphones for around the same price, but I like it.- It sounds open. It still sounds a little bit like there's something covering the ears, but I can comfortably make phone calls or sing and hum along to music.- It feels very lightweight and is quite small, yet it doesn't fall out of my ears.But there are some cons that ultimately make me want to return them:- Mediocre battery life: Only rated for 5.5 hours on a single charge, less if you're using it with phone calls as well. I thought this wouldn't be a deal breaker for me, but it is.- The case: The hinge is floppy and loose. The case closes with a latch and button mechanism instead of being magnetic. You have to press the earbuds into the case until they click. Overall, it feels cheap.- I hate the color. Regardless of whether you pick gray or white, it's speckled, which makes it looks like there's dust and nicks on it.- Bluetooth issues: Sometimes I can hear a noticeable reduction in sound quality, or the sound becomes unbalanced between the left and right earpieces. I have this issue as well with my Galaxy Buds+, but it isn't as frequent as it is on the LinkBuds, and only happens when paired with my Macbook. I also sometimes get some sound distortion after a few minutes while watching YouTube videos, and one way to fix it is to pause and play the video. I've never encountered this with my other wireless headphones.Flaws, but not deal breakers:- No touch controls for volume control and going back to the previous track.- The ""wide area tap"" feature is nifty, but can be a bit sensitive. There were a few times where it skipped a track or paused the music while I was eating. I have this issue with the Galaxy Buds+ as well, but it only happens when I'm biting on something hard, like carrots.Overall, I really wanted to like it, but I think I'll wait and see if a future iteration of this product will fix the issues I mentioned above.",True,Color: Gray,[],8.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,544.0,232.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original
3.0,There are better options,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23UFGOPWBZXSG?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2023",2023-06-03,United States,,"So for starters I will say overall I do like the earbuds, but they have some issues that aren't even a thing on other devices.First off is sound quality and overall I am happy with it. The set also has the ability to play RealAudio which is a slight, but noticeable jump in clarity and quality. It was nice, but it didn't compel me to want to download the music apps that supported that feature. Maybe that's something someone else would enjoy more than me so having it as a feature is a plus.Besides sound, you have to think about comfort. This headset at first feels amazing and lightweight. They are gently, but firmly resting in the groves of my ear. The ring shape is also great because not only does it lock in your ear, but it also creates a touch-sensitive area on your ear. I work with gloves so being able to just tap the side of my head is kind of an amazing feature for me.Now there are really only two downsides, but they are kind of big. First is even though the earbuds sit comfortably they tend to cause your ear to conform around them. You probably won't deal with this on regular use, but I keep my buds in for calls as I work in a loud environment where ringtones aren't loud enough. So after 8+ hours your ear will actually develop a sore spot making the next day pretty painful. I off set this by taking breaks and swapping from one bud to the other so it's not a deal breaker for me, but something I wish I knew about. My only other complaint is the best feature which is the touch-sensitive ear ability. Sometimes it doesn't work and other times it goes off when I'm eating or even talking. I can't even see gum or it goes off and on constantly.The features that make this device unique and interesting as well as intuitive are actually the biggest complaints I have. I'm not against these features and I would like to see them come back in the future, but they need work.",True,Color: White,[],9.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,544.0,232.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original

I don't like earbuds because I don't like cramming a tip in my ear canal. For people who are hearing impaired and still want to be a pedestrian with good awareness of your surroundings, these work well for walking around town. The sound quality is good enough, considering the speaker design. They are comfortable to wear, but positioning for better audio quality can be tricky.After about a year, the LinkBuds started sounding distorted and has buzzing sounds. I was hoping the Sony brand and price premium would mean longer lasting, higher quality products. These have a place, but only if you can get them at a steep discount. The Mee Pebbles are a great alternative at $20-30. I bought a pair for the office about 4 months ago - not sure if they'll hold up in the long term.

5.0,Headphones that immerse you into whatever your listening to and the world around you!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VXG7LBRRMBJX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,19 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2022",2022-02-23,United States,,"If I had to give someone a quick down and dirty written review of these headphones I think this would be it. I have been looking for earbuds like these for a while. I have a small ear canal so using earbuds that fit into my ear Canals comfortably is hard for me. The last earbuds that were every day drivers for me were the Samsung galaxy buds live and those were my favorite because they stayed in my ear and stayed stable regardless of the activity. These do the same thing also, they stay inside my ears regardless of what I'm doing and the fit is somewhat comfortable for long periods of wear they were mort comfortable before I switched to a large wing tip but they feel more secure now. These do not have noise canceling but I think if your looking for ear buds like that then these are not the earbuds for you. If you're getting them so you can hear the environments true outside sounds due to the open hole design its perfect at blending the two, outside sounds and inside sounds. I guess the volume at which you listen to media also determines how much of the outside you hear but don't get it twisted no matter how loud the music is you will still hear extremely loud and important things such as car horns sirens etc. If that is the kind of environment that you live or won't to operate these in then they are perfect. I have use a lot of headphones and earbuds that have accompanied software and I have to say that these have some of the best software that I have used. The companion Sony headphone app has all the useful feature like and EQ and more. It also has some features that I haven't seen before like like tap touch control but their different. Instead of taping the earbud you tap your jaw/temple area to active controls such as play pause etc which is a nice feature. Comes in handy when you're wearing a beanie or hat that covers your ears. They also have one great feature that I have never seen or used on earbuds before...maybe it a sony thing but its cool. The Earbuds will play and pause whatever you listening to when they detect you speaking to someone which is a great feature for me and maybe some of you. It take out that step of having to tap the earbuds or using your watch or phone to stop the music to speak with someone. I love this feature when I'm out grocery shopping and run into these random conversation scenarios. This feature can also be somewhat bothersome when you're into your music and you jamming out and you decide to sing to the song and the music stops. I guess it's not that much or a problem for me though because I just turn the feature on and off when I don't want to or want to use it. Something else that I want to touch on is the case. This is usually where the best headphone manufactures fall short. The case build will be crappy or built without other things in mine. One big thing that was a problem with my earbuds live was the case. If I dropped the case with the earbuds in it they would go flying out of the case when it hit the ground. The case for these is small compact with great reserve charging battery power. The case snaps closed and the ear buds  snap into the case through magnets and clips and the are super secure in my opinion, just incase you drop them. The battery life is great on them also I use them for the past couple of days for long periods of time and I was not able to kill them in a single listen. The case battery life is less than usual but its it still comparable to other earbuds on the markets. You can pair the earbuds with devices with the bottom button on the case without the app which is good and the battery indicator light is basic and strait foward for as charging and and battery usage and you can see it regardless of if the case is opened or closed. These are usually things that the other manufactures mess up. Sound quality is fantastic for open design headphones but not as good as a sealed design. All and all these are my new favorite everyday driver headphones. This review pertains to the points that are import to me. I purchased them at the launch price and I think they are worth it.

5.0,Must have!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22PCVS03F1AZ8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,306 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2022",2022-02-18,United States,,"As someone who has suffered his whole life with pain from wearing earbuds (most types) these are definitely a must have if you are in the same boat.For some reason I can’t handle iems. If they go in the ear, or even AirPods. My ears have always been so sensitive that any pressure results in pain or swelling. I try to stay away from most in ear styles for this main reason.A secondary reason is the pressure from the sound isolation has never been comfortable to me. Feeling like I’m underwater, rather than silence. It’s awful.AirPods 3 were my go to since their release late last year, but they still caused a bit of discomfort. They would also fall out. The convenience of using iOS and AirPods plus the higher than average sound quality made me push through.Before the AirPods 3 I used the Galaxy buds Live. They were great. Most comfortable I’ve ver used. No issues with comfort. Despite enjoying the ANC implementation whereas it focused on outside lower frequencies like hums and engines (opposed to something like the AirPods Pro which attempt to block all sound). I didn’t like how quiet they were. The sound quality was great in a decently loud room but when I was at work with heavy machinery it got hard to hear without cranking up the sound which caused a bit of distortion.Enter the Sony Linkbuds. Out of the box these things come with the medium wing tip which to my horror began causing some burning sensations from the pressure. I swapped them out for the small on both ears and voila. Perfect fit. Perfect volume.It feels like you have nothing in the ear. The Galaxy buds live were close to perfect but they did block sound a bit when you were wearing them. The whole in these Linkbuds make it so that’s a problem of the past.The auto speech detect works well. Too well honestly that I feel like I’m killing my battery by having it on.  Speaking of batter it’s still to be seen how long they last. The app will show one percentage one minute and then it’ll jump down like 20%. I don’t think it updates frequently but it’s jarring.The extra features like spatial audio and Alexa are cool but I use iOS and those aren’t that well supported. Maybe in the future, but right now don’t buy the buds if you have iOS and want to make use of those features.The spatial audio is similar to AirPods 3 and pro implementation. It works very well with the supported apps. Seems highly unlikely more will add the feature though.I’m assuming on android it’s a system wide effect that can be toggled on or off. So if you have an android I’d look for more information elsewhere.The last thing I want to mention that makes these a must have is the wide area tap. Every time I tap it registers the proper gesture. EVERYTIME! That’s huge. With my Galaxy Buds I would always skip songs, or be unable to accept calls because the tapping was so inaccurate. Most tap to use headphones suck ass and for me, caused me physical pain to use. Here you don’t tap the headphone. You actually tap your temple… sort of. The side of your head. It’s like something out of a sci-fi movie and it works.Few quirks when using these with iOS but most are now standard fare if you don’t use AirPods. Stuff like sometimes the screen will come on when I use Siri so my thigh will cancel out commands. I don’t use Siri that much anyways. And when I do need an assistant it’s only to do math problems for me that I’m too slow to do on my own. But it is something to be wary about.Alexa implementation is good and works well, but again, Alexa can’t do as much as Siri: most of the things you’d ask her are like music selections. It’s kind of a non issue for me personally.Also the app to set these up is kind of annoying to use. Features work, but the menus are confusing to know if they are turned on or not. Certain apps seem like they are required to set up certain features but not really. I spent about five minutes in the soundscapes app wondering how to I use the spatial audio for movies only to realize the app was trying to tell me the soundscapes app is compatible with the buds and that’s the end of the integration.To use Alexa and Spotify features make sure to go to assign menu and change the left or right settings to the proper apps. Then the rest of the features will work. It’s very confusing at first.With time as I use these through the warm up period they might get better sounding but the fit and comfort are apparent from the start. If you have sensitive ears please try the xs wingtips. Those are the ones on all the promotional material but for some reason they come with the medium.This is my first review on Amazon and I just had to let everyone with similar problems to me that we’ve been saved. The perfect earbud is here.For everyone else you might feel a bit let down. They aren’t as bass heavy as IEM’s and definitely don’t block outside sound. Some people really don’t want to hear anything and these aren’t for those people.

5.0,Great for casual use,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y9ZDS3H95PQL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022",2022-02-24,United States,,"I LOVE these earbuds. They are my go to buds for casual use around the house or going for walks.I have in-ear buds with noise canceling for noisy environments and over-ear headphones for critical listening with tons of bass, but I hate them for casual use. In-ears hurt my ear canals after a short time, they make by ears feel hot and uncomfortable, and I don't like the noise isolation. My in-ear buds block outside sound, even with transparency mode enabled, so much that I can constantly hear my own breathing, chewing, and even walking around the thumps of my feet hitting the ground. When listening to loud music it's fine, especially when I want to drown out the outside world, but for casual use like watching TV or Youtube, podcasts or any spoken word, hearing the sound of my own bodily functions vibrating through my skull is very distracting and anxiety inducing.The LinkBuds are far more comfortable in the short term. They allow my ears to breath and sound to come in naturally so I don't feel claustrophobic. Even when listening to loud music I can hear when people call my name, or a knock at the door and I need that ability. I went from the medium size rings which pushed the buds too hard into the bottom of my ear to the small size and those fit perfectly in my ears. The XS size was a little too small and the part that sticks out to keep them in your ears didn't have enough spring to them so they started to hurt. They can take a little time to get used to inserting them properly. I found that I can put them in my ears perfectly as long as I don't mess with them after. If I try to adjust them while in my ear they can get uncomfortable quickly, so I take them out and pop them back in without messing with them after. They mostly just fade away from my awareness and I don't think about them until the battery runs low. They are small and light, and I have not been able to shake them out of my ears no matter how hard I try. They are hard plastic so they can start to hurt over long periods, especially if I rest the side of my head against a pillow. The battery lasts for the advertised 4-5 hours, so when the battery gets low I take them out and let them fully charge before using them again and by then my ears have recovered.For casual use in a mostly quiet environment they are amazing and they sound great as well. I enabled the bass boost EQ present in the app and even heavy-bass music sounds good. The clarity is great, I can hear each instrument in a band individually and not smeared together like poor quality bass-heavy buds and headphones. The LinkBuds are not ideal for noisy environments, however. You could probably get away with a podcast on the bus, or for background music to put on while you focus on something else, but they don't get loud enough to compete with a blender or construction site. I'm rarely in such a noisy place so for my routine they are perfect, but your mileage may vary. I have alternative buds for those situations, but if you can only buy one set of headphone you will need to weigh the pros and cons. Calls sound clear and people can hear and understand me just fine without raising my voice.My only real complaint is the wireless range can be lacking with certain devices. When they are paired to my Pixel 6 the range is excellent. Although I usually have my phone in my pocket, if I walk from one side of my house to the other without my phone on me I don't get any kind of stutter or interruption to my music. If I pair the LinkBuds to my laptop or my Chromecast with Google TV I will have stuttering or artifacts if I'm more than 10 feet away, especially if I don't have direct line of sight between me and the device they are paired to. The 1.0.4 firmware update seems to have improved this range a bit, at least I don't have range issues from my TV to my couch anymore, but this is pretty disappointing. I hope they improve the range further in future updates.I hope Sony takes this idea further and releases improved versions in the future, but the LinkBuds are still worth the price for me and worth recommending for someone to hates in-ear buds.",True,Color: Gray,[],3.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1392.0,277.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original
5.0,The Earphones I've Been Waiting For!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HE4GOVCT3E1V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2022",2022-06-10,United States,,"I already own a fantastic pair of open-back over-ear headphones (HiFiMan Sundara), but I've had to put up with closed-back earphones for years now because I had no other choice. Finally though, Sony has released the first ever open-back EARPHONES, and they offer features no closed-back ones could.You get a nicely-constructed recyclable case and earphones that come with several sized sets of ear hooks, which are key to keeping them secured within your ear. Unlike closed-back earphones, these DO NOT need to be inserted into your main ear canal (this helps with comfort), but instead sit in your outer-ear area with the help of those ear hooks. While wearing them, you hear everything around you the way it naturally sounds vs. ambient or transparency mode's ""artificial recreation"" of those same sounds (i.e., wind, running water, etc). It's much nicer this way.TWO MAIN POINTS need to be understood before buying these:1) Fit is EVERYTHING: The goal with these earphones is to make sure you have the right fit while wearing them. It's even more important than with closed-back earphones IMO. You should be using the LARGEST EAR HOOK that you can COMFORTABLY handle wearing in your ear (you push the hook BEHIND the rear flap of you ear). This means a little patience and some trial & error, but once you find the right fit, you really can see & hear what these can do! For me, that meant going with the large ear hook on my left side, and extra large hook on my right (since my left ear is slightly smaller than the right one). This is what worked for me, but everyone's different. Once they're in your ears, rotate forward a bit, then slightly back for the BEST FIT!Having the right fit means you don't need to boost the volume up as loud because the earphones don't get any extra distance from your ear canal. It also means better isolation (and therefore, improved bass!!), as well as more comfort as well as clearer sound. I've found that these won't give you AS MUCH bass as closed-backs do, but it was enough for me since I'm not a basshead anyway. How you EQ them matters too.................2) EQ'ing makes a difference: The Sony Headphones app will give you this option, so take advantage of it. You can EQ it manually yourself, or else just use any of the many presets. There's an even a Bass Boost option as well which you can adjust too. For now, I just leave the EQ in the Sony app off since I use a third-party app to play my downloaded music (Poweramp), and have just created an EQ in that app to use with the LinkBuds in there. But when using other apps like Spotify or Amazon Music, I may look into using one of the EQs in the Sony app. **Update: I've found that the ""Bright"" EQ preset sounds the best to me from that bunch.****2nd update: If you like to stream, Poweramp JUST recently came out with an EQ app designed primarily for streaming music, available only on Android. Look for ""Poweramp EQ"" on Google Play Store, designed by MAX MP. Once downloaded, it will by default work automatically with Spotify and YouTube Music (and maybe Pandora??!). To make it work with Pandora, Amazon Music, regular YouTube, etc., you need to go to YouTube and search ""How to enable Poweramp Equalizer for all music players (For Redmi, MI and POCO devices, etc.)"" by Rinmawia. His video will show you a very quick & easy way to unlock the full potential of Poweramp EQ! Once you get it, I recommended pulling up the ""Rock"" EQ preset, then tweaking the pre-amp up to about 5-5.5, and the bass levels (1st 3 bars) down a couple notches. If listening on a train though or noisier area, I'd suggest actually bumping those bass levels up and the pre-amp to about a 3.**Moving on...........I mainly use these for when I do my cardio workouts outdoors. Since they are open-back, I can hear my surroundings, and therefore if someone is trying to talk to me in person, or one of the workers on my condo complex is coming up from behind in their mobile karts, I'm more likely to hear them coming now than before. You're just more aware of your surroundings, which is great. Of course, you have to put the volume up a bit louder vs. when you're indoors, but I still feel like I can hear what's going on around me better than ever before.With the right fit & proper EQ, these sound & feel FANTASTIC! Not only does my music sound crystal clear, but also I'm told when speaking to people on the phone that they sound crystal clear there too..........no echos, feedback, etc.Very highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",True,Color: Gray,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PrhfdJAbL._SY88.jpg'],4.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1392.0,277.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original
5.0,Extremely good for users not served well by traditional earbuds,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV61XH8YY7MQT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2022",2022-07-08,United States,,"I love these earbuds but I am a user with specific preferences. Disregarding fit and comfort which will vary by user, Airpods and even competing sony products are probably a better choice for the average user.For me though, I do not like the fit of Airpods (Pro) or silicone tipped earbuds generally. I’m also not a huge fan of the isolation normal earbuds provide. I just like being able to hear the outside world, and don’t mind that ambient noise intrudes. I have closed back headphones I can put on if I really want to closely listen to something. The combination of these personal preferences makes Linkbuds ideal for my use.I’ve owned both Airpods Pro and Pixel Buds to compare. Like I said, I was not satisfied with feel of either. Linkbuds solved that problem.The sound quality is Good. It is naturally going to be worse than more closed/isolated options like Airpods. The sound quality does vary somewhat based on how they sit in your ear, but for videocalls and casual use, this is a non-issue to me.The included wingtips required some trial and error to find the right fit. My ears are apparently different size so I use the large wing on one side and the medium on the other. They stay in pretty well. If you are doing jumping jacks or headbanging, perhaps these are not ideal. The silicone tip on traditional earbuds provides a more secure attachment to the ear that Linkbuds lack by design.Sony’s software is mediocre. The features provided do work, but it feels like a 5-10 year old app. At least the App does exist for iOS unlike Pixel Buds.Pairing is consistent for me. I can easily switch between paired devices. Linkbuds can pair up to like 8 I think before you start needing to re-pair things. Windows/MacOS/iOS/Android all work well for me.The case is small and light. Very light. It is thicker than Airpods, so it doesn’t feel as vanishingly tiny despite smaller other dimensions. I don’t store them in my tight jeans so this is not a big deal to me, but something to consider if you do.Battery life is acceptable. I think Google and Apple have them beat, but I don’t really find its a problem. I’m seeing about 3-5hrs depending on use.Controls are novel. You tap around or on the buds in various combinations to execute commands. This works as well as other solutions I’ve tried. It does occasionally make a mistake and execute a command because I was chewing food and it picked up my jaw moving as a tap. You can adjust the sensitivity in the app to dial it in, and also reassign what various combinations do. I don’t think method is necessarily any worse or better than competitors. If you want volume control this way you need to devote either the entire left or right side to vol controls. Instead I have playback controls on the right and then voice assistant on the left (and if i need to adjust volume handsfree, I can ask siri to do so). Otherwise I use the device volume adjustment.I’m concerned that in the future, a product like this will not exist and I’ll have to adapt again. This is just a downside of preferring a niche product.If you’re looking for something different than traditional designs, I think you should give Linkbuds a try.

They’re the only headphones that work for all these activities, don’t fall out (even during inversion yoga poses), and allow you to hear your surroundings. I especially love the safety of hearing cars/cyclists approaching when exercising outside.They work great under over-ear winter hats/headbands - where my other earbuds get pressed uncomfortably against my ear and need constant adjustment, these don’t get moved at all. They don’t interfere with sunglasses or my bike helmet… they just feel like a natural part of your ear.The sound is great for casual listening to music and podcasts/videos and the mic picks up my voice well for phone calls. I like the (optional) Adaptive Volume Control that automatically raises the volume just a bit when a car is passing and then drops it back to normal.

I needn't have been. I'm sure they aren't for everyone, and I get that too, but they are perfect for me. At almost any given point in time I have an earbud in one ear or the other, at work, at home, pretty much everywhere. I think the form factor here is what most people have an issue with, because then let in too much ambient noise, but that is exactly what these are meant to do, there's a big hole in them after all to do just that. To be clear, I don't use then for music, I use them primarily to listen to podcasts, audiobooks and phone calls. I work at a bar with live music and karaoke a few days a week and I can still hear the audiobooks going even with the band playing and drunk people screaming, and that's with just one earbud in. My other pair of earbuds that I've been using for the past few years are the galaxy buds live (the little bean looking ones) and I do understand that for some people the form factor is an issue. I can see how that would be an issue for these as well for some people. We all have different ears and unfortunately there's no real way to tell if your ear will support these comfortably or not.

I wear these when my surroundings are generally quiet or I just want some ambient music added to my surroundings.I also wear these to bed. They are really comfy even when side sleeping (though you can feel it a little), and I have small ears.There is a little bit of a learning curve to learning how to use them, but it's easy now.If I want to actually watch content on my phone/tablet and hear nothing else, I switch these out for my XM4 over ear headphones or go to a quiet room where I can wear these linkbuds.These aren't for everyone, but they are perfect for me.

They might not be for you, though. Regardless, I think everyone should own a pair of these as they're super functional.USE CASE:I really don't like the earbuds that cram into your ear canal, so after owning the Samsung Galaxy Buds I knew my next pair must be open-fit, however, the ones that are on the market have so many downsides. I even considered buying the AirPods, but as an Android user, that would be deranged (as the features are very limited unless you're on the Apple ecosystem). But then I found the LinkBuds. They check all my boxes: comfortable, portable, good sound and call quality. I love that I can hear my music or podcast and still hear the outside world. I use them all the time when I'm at the office, going around doing errands, and even in the house, and sometimes I don't even notice I'm wearing them, they have a light yet secure fit.PROS:Sound quality. Yes, bass is  little lacking, but in exchange you get an open, clear soundstage, great highs and mids, and if you get Sony's app you can crank the bass boost and get good bass levels.Functionality. You can hear your music, podcast or video and still hear everything around you clearly. This is most useful in an office space, where you need to be able to hear the people around you, or when walking, running, or working out so you can be aware of your surroundings.Innovation. Sony is pioneer coming out with fresh ideas when everyone else is doing the same thing, so if you're into tech, you should be happy by owning a quality product that is so different from everything else out there. I'm excited to see what Sony does on future iterations of this product, which hopefully will improve on some of the downsides.CONS:Battery life. One of the major flaws. Don't get me wrong, the battery life is decent, lasting up to 6 hours for me on a single charge (plus 3 more charges from the case), but if these buds are meant to be worn all day one would think that they should last longer, perhaps closer to 8 hours.Lack of wireless charging. I love the practicality of wireless charging, and honestly at this price point they should include it. My guess is they wanted to keep the case as small possible, but I'd gladly trade it for a slightly bigger case that supports wireless charging.No high-res codec. Again, at tis price point they should include support for Sony's high-res codec LDAC. In any case the sound is pretty good with SBS or AAC codec.As I said in the beginning, I think everyone should own a pair of these LinkBuds, since they are a super practical and innovative piece of technology.",True,Color: Gray,[],9.0,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1392.0,277.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 89, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}}",Sony Linkbuds original

All other buds hurt my ears after an hour.4) Stay in my ears even if I move around often. This is an all-day comfort fit.5) Clear mic audio for phone calls and web meetings.These buds checked all of the boxes for me.

These headphones are a niche product, but I really think this design choice deserves more credit. The open back nature of these headphones add a really natural effect to sound. However it does come at the cost of base and treble response since an open back earbud naturally does not create a seal. BUT.... that lack of seal was the exact reason I purchased these. Normal earbuds with rubber plugs are very irritating to my ears. Especially when using the controls, having to constantly seal them back in my ear, or taking them in and out to talk to people. Call quality was amazing as the listener, although the mics I would say are ""adequate at best"". The added benefit of them not muffling outside noises was a HUGE plus for talking to people, commuting, and just overall being comfortable. These where my favorite earbuds ever until....These units started failing on me a little over the 1 year mark. The case often flashes orange when charging (indicating a charging issue), the right earbud rarely charges at all anymore and the left one has some kind of issue where the charge level is all over the place when in use and does not last very long. Even new though, the right bud would drain about 3x faster than the left one, but until recently was not an issue problematic enough for me to care about. I am not the type to abuse my tech, these never where exposed to water, I never left them in a hot car, etc.I contacted Sony about this 3 times in the span of the last 2 months. The first time they told me they would exchange it for a new pair but to contact them again in a week when they finished system repairs on their end to process it. The second time, they told me to do some trouble shooting steps first and then they would exchange it if it was still behaving weird. On the third time they told me I was outside of warranty and that they would not be exchanging it. They would not listen to me telling them the other 2 reps said they would exchange it, they did not care when I told them I had the chat transcripts to prove it. Only on the 3rd conversation did they tell me my device was purchased more than a year ago, then attempted to lie about the first 2 not knowing about that (even though that was the first question both of them asked) and then referred me to a repair center to pay it out of pocket myself. Which obviously, would cost more then the buds did themselves. Even explaining how the first 2 techs asked for purchase date as the first question did not phase them. I even had a case number, which I used to file a complaint and they still did not care. For anyone reading this, I am not upset my device was out of warranty. I am upset they doubled down on saying they would exchange it wasting weeks of my time to only at the end deny it like they where giving me the run around. Just stating the first time it was out of warranty would have been fine, and this review would be a lot better. To any Sony Rep thinking about sending the ""Sorry you had a bad experience please contact us"" copy/paste response to this, I am not interested, you have already shown how you communicate with existing customers and I am not interested in being lied to for a month again.

I replaced these with the $50 SoundPeats Air3 HS, which gives all the open-air goodness without the sacrifice in sound quality.Full Review: I really wanted to love these, there is so much good packed in here! Sony's app is great and Wide Area Tap should be standard on all earbuds. It's sooo cool to tap your cheek to skip tracks! The case is small, the buds are small, light and secure. The build quality is great, and the environmental efforts are welcome.Unfortunately they're terrible at the one thing they're built for: Music. No matter the genre, it sounds sooo bad, even compared to my 10 year old airport cheapo earbuds. Any set of headphones that came free with any listening device will easily sound better than these Linkbuds.Also, they're very uncomfortable to me after an hour, due to the hard plastic donut. The tapered design of Airpods/SoundPeats feels just fine and stays just as secure.For open air, get a clone of the 1st gen Airpod, the one with no silicone tips. If you don't need an app, I found the SoundPeats Air 3 provides a good open-air experience with plenty of bass and dynamic range. If you need to hear your surroundings, the transparency mode of most ~$150 ANC earbuds will be a much better solution. I love the Sony App, so I can recommend the Airpods S, which is just about as small as these and sound almost as good as Sony's XM4 and have excellent transparency mode.I wanted to use the Linkbuds for my daily headphone, but instead I chose the SoundCore Liberty 4, which has awesome sound quality, an nice app, and much more comfortable shallow fit.

It does what it says, lets in ambient sound (more about that in the cons)2. Wide area tap works and was better than putting pressure on the air piece3. Sound were clear and crisp ( given there was no background noise )Cons:1. Getting a perfect fit on this pair is almost impossible unless your ears look like the ones in the cartoon they show. Based on your fit the sound level can be very low. I assume if you have a good fit the sound will get louder but for me it never fit well, and the sound level was very low. I had to keep it at max all the time while listening to podcasts during walking/biking.2.  It does let in ambient sound so if you are walking beside a road forget about it working at all. You won’t be able hear anything (probably due to the low sound level).3. My ears hurt after wearing these for 2hrs and I did not feel like wearing this anymore.4.

5.0,"Excellent and Sleek, but Not Perfect",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IS0IOF5KRPM9?ASIN=B0B1N7SGMZ,203 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022",2022-12-29,United States,,"This is one of those situations where a 4.5 star rating would've been nice. And even though I point out a lot ticky-tack issues, I'd by these again, no problem.PROS:- Excellent sound quality, especially for the price point and size- Lightweight- Premium design of both the buds and case- Wireless charging on the case is a nice touch (especially since they kept wired charging with it)- Excellent batter life- Solid (if not perfect) noise cancellation- Multi-device switching is awesome- Single-bud use works greatCONS (and these are rather minor, but I'll cover them in detail):- Fit is finicky, regardless of earbud tips- Tend to slip out/loosen fit with too much jaw/head motion- Controls too easy to accidentally trigger- Sometimes auto-connection failsIn General:For true audiophiles, you're not going to be bowled over with the ANC or sound quality, but you will be satisfied with the performance. For normal users, you'll love the rich depth and sound quality out of such a compact and well-designed package. The tools for sound adjustment work well, and if you're not used to ANC, you'll find the experience very cool, if not a little disturbing in how well it isolates background noise, especially continuous din/hums. The multi-device capability is something I've wanted for years out of my Bluetooth devices; not just the ability to connect to multiple phones (which many devices have) but to switch between media playback on the different devices seemlessly. Add to this the wireless charging of the case and you've got an excellent overall package that sounds great, travels well, and ticks all the usability boxes.Fit:This is one of those things that's going to change from person to person, because ears are so varied. First, it took a bit to find the right sized ear tip for each ear, going back and forth testing the sound quality and seal for ANC. Next, there was just getting used to the way the buds sit inside the ear: the body of the bud is a bit on the bulky side compared to some other earbuds, so it took a little while to grow comfortable with the feel. The light weight build however really helped here.Exercise:Regarding the claims of ""secure fit"", well... I'm an athletic person, and I'd strongly advise against using these in training. First - and this may be a problem for some but not others - if you sweat a lot you'll end up with sweat buildup behind the buds (in the ear), which is not a nice feeling. Second, despite the claims of a secure fit, I find that even just walking around or chewing gum they'll tend to loosen over time. Again, could be the way my jaw/ears are shaped, but even while doing basic tasks/maintenance around the house I found they'd loosen, especially if my head changed orientation. I wouldn't wear these training outdoors anyway (since you should hear your surroundings for safety) but even wearing them during weight training I'd find they'd loosen when moving from standing to prone positions and back again.Another note: if you're using Ant+ devices (HRM, power meter, cadence sensor, etc.), I found that these tend to lead to more dropouts than my other BT headsets. Not sure if it's the stronger signal, or the multiple signals from each bud, etc., but it's something to be aware of.Controls:The touch controls mean you don't have to push them into your ear to control them, which is nice. And they do work exactly as advertised. The compact size can lead to some mis-clicks, especially when taking them in/out of the ears. The ability to program what the long-press does on one or both buds is a nice touch.Connectivity:For the most part, this works excellently. Once in a while, it will fail to connect to my phone automatically. However, this is no different than my other BT devices. When switching from a single bud to both buds, I've occasionally encountered sync/distortion issues requiring me to reconnect them. Single strength however is strong, and I've been able to remain connected to devices in other rooms, much further than my other BT headsets.Call Quality:This one is... odd. Sometimes it's great, especially when using both buds - never had a problem when using both. When on a single bud though, I've had trouble with people hearing me clearly. The clarity of the other person on the line has never been a problem, however.Overall:This is a great ""premium-features at sub-premium price"" option for those that want good sound on the go.",True,Color: Charcoal,[],1.0,B0B1N7SGMZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B1N7SGMZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B1N7SGMZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,3990.0,610.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 113.85, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 151.68, 'currency': '$'}}",Pixel Buds Pro
5.0,Very impressive and worth a try.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY0VIO4D9R945?ASIN=B0B1N7SGMZ,123 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022",2022-07-30,United States,,"My newly purchased Pixel Buds Pro will be joining my ever expanding fleet of TWS, currently comprising of Bose True wireless earbuds, Sennheiser CX, Edifier NeoBuds Pro, Soundcore Liberty Air 2's, AirPods Pros, along with several cheaper units from random brands that I use as throwaways.To start things off, the fit of these is great. Although always subjective, but being on the picky side, I must admit that I was pleasantly impressed with the way these fit. After six hours of wearing them, there was no fatigue or discomfort that I experienced.Once adjusted to your liking, these tend to stay in. I took them out for an hour long run and found no issues. They stay planted and feel secure, allowing you to focus on your workout without any distractions.Connectivity wise, these were a breeze to set up. Right out of the box they paired with my Samsung Galaxy S10+. Once synced with the phone, I was prompted to download the Pixel Buds app. You will mostly use this to adjust your touch controls, set noise cancellation/ transparency mode, as well as the multipoint mode (more on that later). For now, the app lacks traditional EQ adjustment from the sound control section. This is apparently coming later this year, along with spatial sound.The multipoint mode allows you to sync the earbuds to two devices simultaneously. I had the buds paired to my phone as well as my laptop. I was able to go back and forth between the two devices without any issues. Simply pause playback on the first device, and resume playing audio on the second device. In my testing I found no issues with audio lag while watching Netflix and YouTube.The sound quality is superb. In my testing, I found these to reproduce clear sound and accurate notes across various volume levels. The highs are just right, although not as punchy as some of the other earbuds in my collection.As of this writing 7/30/22, the volume EQ feature that enhances bass and treble at low volume levels is absent in the pixel buds app on my S10+. I contacted Google, since it is something that should be available in the app. Upon a lengthy troubleshooting session, the support team agreed to escalate the issue to their development team for further review.The active noise cancellation is good. It won't drown out the entire world around you, but when music is playing I found that it did an excellent job. I will be taking these on a flight later this year and will update the review to reflect my experience as far as in-flight performance of ANC.The battery life of these is excellent! In my testing, I got just short of the seven hours of battery life that Google promised with ANC on. The quick charge worked great. In just minutes I was back to listening tunes and enjoying the buds.Transparency mode on these is adequate. I didn't think it was lacking, but did feel that perhaps things could have been a bit clearer. It is nothing worth complaining about, but perhaps slightly boosting the gain may be considered an improvement.Overall, these are wonderful. Taking into consideration the excellent sound, comfort, battery life, along with some of the more advanced features, makes it an excellent value for the asking price of $200. The obvious omission of advanced codecs, such as LDAP and aptX did not diminish my experience, at all. I found that they sounded just as clear as some of my higher end buds without any latency issues that is normally associated with AAC and SBCTLDR: If you are looking for excellent sound, comfort, ANC, and battery life, give these a try. The pixel bud pro are an excellent value with very little compromise. If LDAC and aptX is a must have, then look further, but I would encourage you to reconsider.",True,Color: Charcoal,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715y7-cB4lL._SY88.jpg'],2.0,B0B1N7SGMZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B1N7SGMZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B1N7SGMZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,3990.0,610.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 113.85, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 151.68, 'currency': '$'}}",Pixel Buds Pro
5.0,"A quality set of bud from Google, that can surpass more expensive options",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXCZQBLHZ2B5T?ASIN=B0B1N7SGMZ,518 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2022",2022-10-27,United States,,"In addition to being a headphone addict, I was looking for another option for a quality set of  wireless NC ear buds for air travel.  Currently I use over-the-ear Sony WH1000XM (original V1) OR Bose Wired in ear QC20's.  Both sound good and have very good noise cancelling.  However, I wanted to reduce the bulk while traveling and have an option to go wireless as my new phone does not have an audio jack.  Enter this review, and my comparison between the Sony WF 1000XM4's and the Google Pixel Buds Pro (PBP).In this review, I used a 0- or 1-point system with 1 point for the winner, 0 points for the loser and 1 point for each for a tie.If you don't want to read through the comparison, just get the PBP's.  These two earbuds are very close in features, sound quality and noise cancelling, but the PBP's are cheaper and still beat out the Sony's based on my scoring...and I really love the Sony’s but cannot justify them for the price difference!For my smaller ears the Sony's were a bit more uncomfortable. Ultimately both are really good ear buds, and it comes down to a matter of fit and price (at least for me).  If price is not an option and you have larger ears go with Sony, otherwise go with the Pixel Buds Pro.Detailed reviewPrice: Both were purchased on sale, so the Sony's were $250 (regularly $280) and the PBP's were $150 (regularly $199).  In my opinion, PBP's are a bargain compared to the Sony's!  Winner: PBPFit: PBP smaller and lighter.  Sony, foam tips seal well, but can be scratchy in the ear and feel hotter.  For my smaller ears the PBP's were just more comfortable. Winner: PBPNoise Cancelling: Sony is better with NC and foam tips.  PBP's not far behind though. With proper ear tips, the Sony's will block out slightly more noise in air travel.  In the office, it is also close, but some of the higher pitched sounds will make it through on the PBP's.  Overall, it is pretty close given the cost difference between the two, and Sony's reputation for Noise cancelling. Winner: SonyBass -no/flat EQ: Both are bass heavy buds. Winner: TieMid - no/flat EQ: Both have OK Mids. Sony's seem slightly more subdued, but both were pretty muddy without some EQ help.  The PBP's treble boost may also help the MIDs come out a little more but its too close to call. Winner: TieHigh - no/flat EQ: PBP have an accentuated high-range making music a little brighter but can get shrill.  The Sony's highs were a little dull making for an overall slightly subdued sound Winner: PBPOverall sound no/flat EQ: Sony's sound slightly cleaner out of the box without the EQ, but the two are close.  They both need some EQ help to go from good to great sounding buds. Winner: SonyOverall Sound W/EQ: With some EQ adjustments both can be closely matched.  Sony needs a treble bump, PBP's need treble reduced.  Both need the mid’s bumped slightly. Winner: TieTouch Controls: PBP has more controls available at once.  Both can be changed in the apps, but with Sony you must choose between music control or volume control.  The PBP's can do both with taps or swipes. Both will pause music when the earbuds are removed. Winner: PBPControl feedback: Sony's have spoken audio queue's, PBP's use beeps.  Much easier to know what you changed with spoken responses by the Sony's. Winner: SonyVolume level: At the same volume settings, the Sony's were louder.  For the PBP's it seemed I needed to play these near max volume.  Could be a phone issue, but all volume and app settings were the same for both. This bothered me enough to almost make me not want to keep the PBP's. Winner: SonyBattery Life (ANC on): Sony's seem to have a slight edge, but only by a few minutes. Too close to call Winner: TieCharging: Both have USB C and Wireless charging and charge in approximately the same amount of time.  Number of charges and quick charging (5-minute charge for an hour of play) is the same per the specs. I have not tried this out yet as I always keep these charged. Winner: TieMultipoint (pairing): Sony does not allow you to pair and use with two Bluetooth devices at the same time.  The PBP's do. Shame on Sony for not including this for the price of these headphones. Great feature for office use! Winner: PBPApp: Both apps are well done.  The PBP app is a little easier to use. Both have ear tip check feature which will tell you if you ear tips are sealing well.  I used a smaller tip in one ear and both apps detected a bad seal. Winner: TieCharging Case size: Both are small, but the PBP's have slimmer case and feels better when carried in the pocket. Winner: PBPAssistant features: Both are capable of using Google assistant or Alexa..Yes, the PBPs will work with Alexa Winner: TieAuto Ambient Switch: Only available on the Sony.  If it senses you are talking it will automatically switch to ambient sound pass through and pause your music.  Very useful feature and works well especially on an airplane.  However, if you like to sing out loud you probably want to disable this feature.  Winner: SonyFind my headphones: Only available on the PBPs. You can send a signal and make the buds beep if you misplace them. Winner: PBPBluetooth: Both connect instantly and have great range.  Walking to the other side of my house and through about 3 walls, both ear buds cut out in the exact same location. Winner: TieMicrophone: Did not really test this, based on the soundguys.com review they are close, but in their recorded audio the PBP's mic sounds a bit better to my ear than the Sony's.

Even without music playing, it's hard to hear people talking to you when both are in.-The transparency mode is great. Still gives you solid sound quality but it's not putting you in a sound proof box.-Battery life isn't anything special in comparison to any other set of headphones I've ever owned. They last most of the work day (8 hours) though, so it's not as if it's terrible. If you listen to the volume super low, you'll get another hour or two out of them.-These are super customizable. You can boost bass and all that jazz. Sound quality I'd give a 4/5. They're not THE BEST but they are way above other brands.-The google assistant is nice. It makes a soft beep when a notification pops up, and will read the texts to you. In general, all notifications are a soft sound. When the battery is dying it gives soft little bloops, even if the volume had been up high.-I love the fact it gives you individual battery levels. Each ear bud will have it's own battery percentage on your phone so if you start out with one and pick up the other, you'll know where you're at with each PRIOR to them dying.-Another feature I love love love.... if you take an earbud out, it'll pause your music for you. This extends to movies as well. So if you get interrupted, you won't miss out on anything. Once you put it back in it'll resume playing automatically.-Comfortable fit. It comes with multiple ear tips, but the ones that came on them fit well. No matter what, my ears have always gotten an uncomfortable feeling after wearing them for awhile, but I can go the entire day with these in and it doesn't hurt. Sometimes I actually forget I have them in. They're also movement proof.

I had the Apple AirPods Pro (3rd Gen) previously and remember being on a windy beach and talking to my friend on the phone without missing a beat. When I finally got in my car after chatting with her for about an hour, I asked her if she had heard any of the wind or noise while I was on the beach. She responded incredulously, ""You were on the beach?"" And that's when I realized how absolutely amazing Apple's noise canceling functionality was on their airpods. I did a similar test when I received my Pixel Buds Pro. I remember my friend mentioning the sound of gravel as I walked on the pathway by a local park. With my new Pixel Buds Pro all she heard was my voice when I did the same walk, while I was driving with windows down and vehicles honking on the road, as well as in any other number of loud and boisterous environments. The Pixel Bud Pros perform as well as the AirPods and fit snugly in my ear, rarely every falling out. The only complaint I have about them is that the battery doesn't last much longer than about 2-3 hours when on the phone. The case will charge them up wirelessly but I'd love for them to last a good 6-7 hours without requiring a charge.Outside of that, I am EXTREMELY happy with my purchase and glad I got them at a cheaper price point than the AirPod Pros. I bought them for $149 and so they were $100 cheaper than the AirPods. Best of all, they sync beautifully with my Google Pixel phone, whereas the AirPod Pros were problematic. I had to download a third party app to check the battery life and get them to connect to my phone.

I wasn't sure if the price increase would also have an increase in quality but let me tell you these are. Pretty much every feature on these is premium. The fact that they have noise cancellation in them is great but you can also turn them into essentially hearing aids with pass-through mode. This pass-through mode can even be activated by talking with someone, so you don't have to constantly take them in and out of your ears at work.Sound quality is great and they have lots of smart features like pausing your media when an earbud comes out of the ear, either by accident or when you take them out. The shape is nice because they don't allow getting shoved too far in the ear.My only complaint is that the case is oval so it easily slips out of your hands or a shallow pocket and the lid makes it so the case can't be set on the desk flat while it's open.

Not great sound.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IPUU9GZ4WWJ4?ASIN=B0B1N7SGMZ,165 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2022",2022-08-15,United States,,"The features on this tws iem are the best in class:-Skin-touch controls so you're not accidentally pressing with pillows, or having to push hard on your ears. The controls are definitely the best of any tws I've ever used, and this should be the new standard in the industry. Swipe for volume, tap for calls/play, double tap for skip/hang up, and long press to swap between anc/transparency.-""Hello Google"" works better on these than any other tws I've used, for whatever reason.-Switch only between anc and transparency modes, so you don't need to wait for slow transitions.-Ultra lightweight, has no mass so it can't ever gain momentum to fall out of your ears. Plus, extremely comfortable.-Great battery life compared to others. At the start of my 10hr work day to the end I only need to put them in the charging case for about 5 minutes one time. They recharge FAST.-Strong signal never has dicey connection. I can go about 60 feet away from my phone with these and not lose signal at all. (Any other tws bud is like 10feet.)The ANC and transparency modes-The ANC is interesting, because they're a pretty ""open"" iem so when the battery is dead they let in a lot of the world around you.. but they do a good job canceling noise coming in regardless of low passive isolation. It's usually not as good as a strong earplug, or an ear protection over an iem, but it is still extremely nice.It tends to drown out only the low end of some sounds, like if a white noise is playing you'll still hear all of the high pitch portion. This kind of makes sounds more annoying sometimes rather than making them less annoying even when they're overall lower volume.Transparency mode is super nice, but it doesn't allow you to change the strength of this mode as some other manufacturers do. Google did a good job making it sound natural but without volume control it doesn't do a good enough job of allowing you to hear as well as without them in. Things are still just slightly too quiet with this mode on.Mic and call quality, BT delays-The mics sound fantastic. Listening back to myself sounds incredible. Hardly any compression. Still picks up lots of outside noise but not as bad as most tws.Despite the amazing microphone(s), calls have the nefariously annoying delay. Both when you hear someone and when you speak. Enough to where people notice..This delay is also present when gaming and watching videos. YouTube and major video players will add a delay to synch it and it works great but in competitive games it's really bad.So, even though the BT signal is super strong (and the AAC is a lot less battery intensive! Which is probably the reason they chose it.) If you need a FAST signal then you have to look elsewhere.Luckily, most of us don't actually need a fast signal and I'd 100% take this minor delay over increased battery usage.There's a lot more about the features I could say, but in short I love them. If you're just looking for something light and comfortable (seriously, way way way more comfortable than any other tws out there! Very easy to sleep in and wear all day compared to others!) Then these are great..But.. I must now talk about something very important, and the reason they lose two stars despite all the love I have for them: Sound quality.GOOGLE YOU NEED TO FIRE SOMEONE OVER THIS. Holy biscuits, talk about some of the worst sounding iems above $30 I've ever heard (I've had a couple hundred..)There are no highs. These are what is known as ""dark."" Anything above 10khz is bland sounding.. so anything fun frequency, or with distortion, or anything.. just sounds bad.They sound okay at first because the bass and mids are alright but there is no balance when you get to the highs. They absolutely ruin any electronic or  post 80's rock. I'd take most gas station buds over these for technical listening.But, I think that's what Google was going for: a vocal-centric bud for daily function over musical quality.They nailed the spatial side of audio; the driver placement is perfect for diffuse field and phase generation. And there is even a nice dynamic feeling from bass on the weighty driver.If only the driver had a bit stronger magnet so it could move a little faster, or maybe it literally just needed to be tuned better.. it's just bad at making high frequency sounds and it totally ruins all critical music listening.So, overall, I love the set for work. Audiobooks/podcasts/calls/battery/controls/comfort are all top notch 10/10.But what the heck was Google thinking releasing it with such horrible tuning? Give me 20 minutes with their tuner and they'd have a top of the line product here. It's disgusting what they've done..Maybe they don't think people actually care about the sound of their music.

The only solution is to remove them from Bluetooth devices, put them back in their case and pair them again.Issue 2) Audio will suddenly drop in quality for no discernable reason.

Right out of the box, one of the headphones would crackle loudly as I was pushing them into my ears.  This was painful and distressing at such a high price point, but I could get past that.The main problem was that I was constantly losing them because they fall out of my ears and out of the case.  I tried all of the ear adapter sizes, but was unsuccessful at getting them to sit snuggly in my ear.  I used them at the climbing gym and they would fall out in the middle of a tricky climb, so I would have to descend quickly and try to find them on the floor before somebody stepped on them.Also, because they stick so far out of my ear, the climbing rope would constantly brush them and make my music stop- which again is really irritating in the middle of difficult climb.The worst problem is that if you drop the case any distance at all, the lid will pop open and send the earbuds flying.  It happened right away when I bought them.  They bounce around pretty far, so I eventually found them inside one of my shoes.  This happened again several times.  The last time was when I was climbing outside, and I lost both earbuds.  One of them flew into my friends lap as he was laying downhill on a hammock.  The other I couldn't find.  I put the one I did find in my case AND DROPPED IT AGAIN while searching for the first one.  As normal, the lid popped open and sent the remaining bud flying too.  I was unable to find it amongst the leaves, so now I am out a 200+ dollar set of earbuds.If you buy these, make sure you buy the brightest pair you can find because you are going to be looking for them a lot.

For about one day they worked fine. Then the version 5.9 firmware update happened, and that went OK. The next day I put the ear buds in to go walk the dog, and the right ear isn't working. Hmmm, OK. The battery level for the right ear bud registered zero. Which was odd, as the earbud had been in the charger all night. Nothing I did helped, the factory reset, having my Pixel 6 phone ""forget"" the Pixel Buds, nothing. Then they wouldn't pair at all.So I contacted Google support via chat, they wanted me to let the battery completely drain. Yeah, you can't actually do that when the Buds won't connect at all, so that was zero help. I decided to replace them with a different pair. I had to chat with Amazon customer support to get an actual replacement, because the only option was Refund in the return request. I wanted replacements, as the price had gone up quite a bit overnight. So I have a replacement set. They work fine so far, but the Pixel Buds app would not load on my Pixel phone. It would close every time. I had to follow some instructions I found on the Google support site to reset my phone, so it would basically forget my old Buds ever existed. This wiped a lot of my Google settings, so I had to re-do some of those. I just don't understand why there isn't a real Pixel Buds app and they had to build the functionality into the phone so deeply it required clearing the data for a half-dozen Google apps.

Then do NOT buy these- they make music sound very muddy and muffled. Maybe if you're used to blasting tunes through the smartphone speakers, this could be considered an upgrade in quality, but otherwise no. I ended up returning these and buying Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro and the difference in sound quality couldn't be any more drastic- even without using LDAC codec (pixel buds Pro only support AAC- more on that later).  It was like going from FM radio to a CD. Anyway, this isn't a review of Anker, so moving on...Overall, pixel buds Pro are a massive letdown with half baked design/engineering, and worst of all- VERY poor sound quality. A beta product at best (at least some consistency here from Google and its Beta Universe of Beta Everything). If you're mainly using them for zoom or voice calls, listening to podcasts, etc they might do the trick, but so will a $50 set of buds. But if you intend to use them for listening to music, they simply don't deliver- certainly not for a hefty $150-200 price tag.No amount of EQ tweaking could bring any quality/clarity to the music, albeit the available EQ settings are very rudimentary- just the 5 fixed frequency ""sliders"" (but without actual frequencies/Hz even being indicated) plus a handful of presets.The EQ and other controls worked very well on a Pixel phone as did the Bluetooth pairing- a really slick pairing experience, actually. However, when I tried installing the Pixel Buds app on a NON-Pixel Android 13 phone, it didn't show any of the controls (the app basically didn't work), so YMMV on any device that's not a Google's own phone.The other downside to the app is the very limited configuration options and settings for customizing the touch controls- can not adjust touch sensitivity or just simply disable the touch function (the buds constantly register ""touch"" when they're merely being adjusted and perform random actions as a result).After a couple of days playing with these, I noticed the buds' batteries will drain from just sitting. There is no way to actually turn them off other than by returning into the charging case and closing it (triple tap no longer works). Seriously, Google- a $200 headphone set that is too dumb to not turn itself off when not in use! Or is it too ""Apple"" for you to actually have the buds turn off automatically when they're removed from one's ears, especially considering that all necessary sensors and HW are already there anyway and the headphones ""know"" when they're inserted and removed? At least offer a configurable sleep timer/power save mode- like virtually every gadget on the planet has.Speaking of Apples, while the buds- ostensibly designed for Pixel and Android phones- support Apple's (defacto) AAC codec of all things(!), they lack support for any higher quality codecs, such as Qualcomm Apt-x, Aptx-LL, or Sony's LDAC. If I wanted headphones that are ""married"" to Apple and its AAC, I might've as well bought Airpods Pro or Bose...As there is no way to adjust touch sensitivity or disable the touch function, the buds end up doing random things (play, skip, toggling ANC) while I'm simply adjusting them for better fit. Perhaps on/off functionality would be helpful here too, so that I may first adjust the fit before actually turning them on. And seeing how they automatically turn on when removed from the case, this becomes yet another source of battery drain, should I for whatever reason just put them aside. To avoid battery drain they must be returned to the case every time- no alternatives here. Seems like Apple's ""philosophy"", i.e. ""we've already decided what's best for you and how you should use your device, so we won't give you any options"". Again, if I wanted the vendor dictate how I use my devices, I might as well buy Apple products... Don't we all use Google/Android products because they allow(ed) flexibility instead of forcing the user into doing  things as the vendor decided is the ""best"" (and the only) way ?Fit- while this is subjective, I could never get them to fit securely, despite trying different size ear tips (hence the need for adjustments which wreaked havoc with the touch interface). The buds always felt somewhat loose, albeit that loose fit made them comfortable to wear for hours without any strain or pressure on the ears- guess this is the silver lining. But forget trying to run or exercise in these. The lack of wingtips is probably the biggest issue with the design to ensure a secure fit.The only other thing I liked about these buds besides their ""loose-fitting"" wearing comfort is the ANC- it did a very good job drowning out the sound of rushing water and other background noises.

I am very disappointed with the sound quality. The main reason I bought this pair over other high-end pairs is because it advertised that it could stay paired with 2 devices. I switch between my Pixel 5 phone and MacBook regularly and having a single pair of headphones that can stay connected to both is very useful.Here is what I like about these:1. When I take them off my ears, the video / audio I am playing is automatically paused.2. Noise cancellation is great.3. Pass through / transparency audio is great also.4. Stay paired with 2 devices.Here is what I don't like:1. When I put them on and it connects with my Pixel 5 phone, the headphones will not play audio when playing a music or video. The Bluetooth indicator shows on my phone connected to the headphones. When I press play on the music app / video, the music/video will immediately go to pause mode as if the headphones are not connected and it auto paused it. Repeat and same result. The only way to fix this is to unpair the device with the phone and repair. I have to do this repairing almost 4 out of 5 times I want to connect with my phone.2. While the noise cancellation part is amazingly good, there is a periodic and consistent static noise in both headphones. As I am watching a video on YouTube or taking on a Zoom call on my MacBook, there will be static noise. It will come and go. My old cheap phones never had this issue. This problem has happened from day 1.Overall, the problems I have with this pair is pretty much makes this unusable some days.

I previously had the Buds-A that I loved.  When I heard that the Pro would have active noise canceling, I got all kinds of excited.  I did not buy them at launch, because I figured they would be discounted pretty quick...which was accurate.Anyways, when I received them, I immediately noticed how much heavier they are.

I have to say, the experience was much better than that of the AirPods Pro (APP). When I walked, I never got that low “thump” in my ears like with the APP, they felt secure, and I didn't need to adjust them after initially inserting them. The best part? Zero pain/pressure after removing them.Using these with a Pixel 8 Pro. The case is very nice and has a matte finish, so it should hide micro-scratches better than the AirPods cases. USB-C, plus wireless charging (Qi).The earbuds themselves are small, and round. This makes them a little difficult to remove from the case, and hold with 2 fingers securely. Inserting the earbuds is equally challenging, since there is no wing to brace against your ear's Concha (The wing exists on the cheaper Pixel Buds A, but not the “Pro” for some reason). Therefore, the earbud might be rotated at an angle that blocks part of a microphone. In my initial testing, I didn't notice this affect the Active Noise Cancelling (ANC).I have tiny ear canals, and therefor need special ear-tips that are smaller than “Small”. Thankfully, my favorite tip maker, Spinfit sells a kit that allows me to use size SS tips (seen in my photos). CP1025 with CPA2 is the kit if anyone wants to try them. Spinfit are the only after-market tips I use on all my IEMs. Well worth the price.The version out of the box for the case, and buds was 1.5. If you happen to read this, do yourself a favor and update the firmware ASAP. Now on version 5.9 (I think), and not only does the default tuning sound better, they added numerous new features, including a customizable EQ*.Going back to the shape, the side of the earbuds (where the color is, and the “G” logo) is one big touch-surface. This is the only method to control the sound when your phone/source is unreachable. This is active as soon as the buds are out of the case, and connected. Inserting them in a secure position will cause your media to play, pause, skip a track or two, call the Assistant, raise/lower the volume. So when you finally have them inserted, it's a gamble as to what will be playing at what volume.They sound good with the new firmware, and can be used for all kinds of music. You might not get the Honda Civic trunk-shaking bass you want, but that is where the EQ comes in. Turn up the “Low bass” slider, and you'll hear it. Max out the bass, and low bass sliders, and you'll get a similar tuning to Raycons if that's your thing (Don't buy Raycons). The ANC is nice. Not thrilling, but nice. I've been spoiled by Sony's ANC. I'd imagine these would work on a commercial plane to drown out the cabin rumble enough to listen to music at a reasonable level. The transparency mode is usable, but doesn't come anywhere close to Apple's version, where it sounds 99% natural. This can always be fixed with firmware updates.I still need some more time with these to decide whether the weird fit is something I can live with or not.*The EQ is very user-friendly, but a little maddening for anyone who uses a multi-band equalizer. None of the frequencies are labeled. Instead, they opt for “friendly” names. Upper Treble, Treble, Mid, Bass, and Low Bass. It's hard to get a good EQ with these options, since I know what frequencies I normally add/subtract to. I'm not sure if the friendly names are a single frequency, or a group. I have a feeling they are a group of frequencies, since “Mid” can consist of 8 or more bands, and bass is usually 4–6 bands. It's better than nothing, though, and shockingly, these buds can do a little sub-bass.",True,Color: Charcoal,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CsTwEMSIL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UKDmfoGfL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71VkGlqjCWL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dEEaGyQhL._SY88.jpg']",1.0,B0B1N7SGMZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B1N7SGMZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B1N7SGMZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,733.0,188.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 113.85, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 151.68, 'currency': '$'}}",Pixel Buds Pro

After a month of testing, here's my honest review:First Impressions:Pulling them out of the slick white case, the Pixel Buds exude a premium vibe. The minimalist design of the case and the earbuds is a big step up from my previous sony earbuds, and the matte finish feels comfortable and secure in my ears. Pairing them with my Pixel 8 Pro was a breeze, thanks to Google's magic sauce of Fast Pair.Sound Quality:The sound quality is where the Buds truly shine. They deliver crisp, clear audio with rich bass and balanced mids and highs. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is surprisingly effective, blocking out most ambient noise without sacrificing audio fidelity. Transparency mode is equally impressive, allowing me to hear my surroundings without taking the Buds out.Call Quality:The call quality is excellent. My voice comes across clearly on the other end, even in noisy environments. The Beamforming technology effectively isolates my voice, reducing background noise and ensuring clear communication. Google has also rolled out subsequent software updates to improve audio quality and it's noticeable. Google IMO is now an industry leader in this area.Features:The Pixel Buds Pro are packed with useful features, including:Adaptive Sound: Automatically adjusts the volume based on your surroundings.Touch Controls: Easy-to-use gestures for controlling playback, volume, and ANC.Google Assistant Integration: Access your Assistant with a simple voice command.Multipoint Connection: Seamlessly switch between devices without disconnecting.Battery Life:The battery life is decent, with the Buds lasting up to 7 hours with ANC on and up to 11 hours with it off but of course I wish it was double the battery length. The case provides an additional 20 hours of charging, which is enough to keep me powered through the day.Fit and Comfort:The fit is secure and comfortable, thanks to the included ear tips in various sizes. I wore them for extended periods without any fatigue or discomfort.Overall:The Google Pixel Buds Pro are a compelling option for tech-savvy individuals who prioritize sound quality, features, and seamless integration with the Google ecosystem. Worth the cost and always recommend checking the reburbished options on amazon.Pros:Excellent sound quality with rich bass and balanced mids and highsEffective ANC and Transparency modeClear call qualityPacked with useful featuresSecure and comfortable fitCons:Price might be high for someBattery life could be betterVerdict:4.5 out of 5 stars.

I mostly listen to audiobooks or podcasts at work, but when watching videos at home, the sounds quality is superb. Many buds don't stay in well or have caused excessive tugging on the canal. By the end of the day, my canal can feel raw. There are loosely fitted buds I've used with good results, but they bleed audio badly. I had the last iteration of pixel buds and they didn't stay in well for me. These stay in BETTER, but if your ear canal is damp, you could experience slippage. Particularly when moving your jaw. Since I have a lots of memory foam tips for various earbuds, I have been able to solve the issue, even during workouts. These are light and rest enough on the cartilage of the ear to not cause pain at the end of the day. As many have said, battery life is also more then sufficient. If you're wearing these at work, you'll be fine. Alternating buds or turning off noise cancellation when not needed will milk the battery for a full shift without putting them in the case. The reason I couldn't wait to get back to pixel buds after trying 7+ other brands, is the controls. Nobody does touch controls like pixel buds yet. I find I have to cup the entire earbuds with others to pause because the controls are so finicky. Beyond that, I can wear one earbud while working and have full control of volume with a swipe left or right. I can choose to use Google assistant for the long tap, control noise cancellation, or use ""hey Google"". Making calls on the job or managing audio when a client needs assistance is smooth. There is a learning curve. These have controls closer to the cartilage of your ear rather than centered over the canal, where you'd normally reach for controls, but compared to others its still ahead of the game.

Once I got them, that concern disappeared. These easily compete with my Sennheiser over-the-ear headphones for sound quality. These have a very flat response, so keep that in mind if you do buy them. You might not be used to that kind of response in an earbud. There are some EQ settings available in the Bluetooth settings for the device. They're really, really good for voice, and quite excellent for music - in my humble opinion.Well, I've now owned these for about 6 months. They still sound excellent, and they still feel comfortable.However, I have never once gotten these to pass the ear seal check. Initially, I didn't think anything about it. I ordered some foam tips to replace the OEM rubber ones, and those also didn't change anything. Again, I just ignored it and used them as is until I got a new phone and decided to set these up again and was reminded that they wouldn't pass the seal test.I decided that the problem might actually be the earbuds themselves, so I contacted service today and explained to them that I could not get these to pass the ear seal test and that I had tried every size tip, and also purchased and tried a complete set of foam tips.They literally told me to return these to Amazon (which I can't, it's been too long) and buy a new set of non-pixel earbuds.So much for that ""one-year"" warranty.I'm not a huge fan of sticking things inside my ears. I also can't get a good seal on these, despite trying all of the ear tips. They sort of feel like they're going to fall out, but they haven't yet. That being said, I've worn them for a few hours while walking my dog, and they seem quite comfortable. I was very interested in the idea that these can somehow equalize the pressure inside my ear so it won't feel like I'm wearing an earplug, and I have to say it feels like they must do something with that. My ears don't feel plugged with these regardless of how far into my ear I shove them.What really convinced me to try these is the transparent mode. I walk on a relatively busy trail fairly regularly and people with bikes tend to scream up from behind me and startle me. So far, I can't really tell any difference between transparent mode and just turning off sound cancellation. I can't give it a fair test right now, though. It's cold here at the moment so my current concern is someone on a snowmobile flying up behind me, but you'll hear a snowmobile even with sound cancellation mode turned on. I'll have to wait until next spring to find out if I can hear someone on a bike. (Edit. Now that I know how to turn it on and off correctly, I can definitely tell the difference. Ambient mode isn't perfect, but I'd say I can hear outside noises slightly better with ambient mode than with my Treks Bone Conduction headphones that don't cover my ears at all. It's also nice to be able to turn it into ambient mode when having a conversation. It still sounds like you're wearing earplugs a bit, but you can have a normal volume conversation and not have to remove your earbuds.)Overall, these are expensive, but if they hold up I don't mind spending a little extra - especially if the transparent mode let's me hear bikes behind me.",True,Color: Fog,[],1.0,B0B1N7SGMZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B1N7SGMZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B1N7SGMZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,297.0,196.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 113.85, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 151.68, 'currency': '$'}}",Pixel Buds Pro

I bought these because the Bose earbuds I loved were discontinued, and I have a Pixel 7 pro so I assumed these earbuds would work really well with them. That has not been the case and I'm strongly considering returning them.Pros:- They charge fastCons:- They don't stay in my ears, regardless of the tip size I choose. They'll tell me the seal is good, then 5 minutes later they fall out.- When I go to reseat them in my ears, they make a squealing feedback noise when noise cancelling is on.- Its impossible to reseat them in your ears without inadvertently pausing your music or changing the noise cancellation settings because of the touch controls.- The touch controls for volume adjustment are difficult. The round face of the bud you need to swipe on is too small and not a great texture to swipe smoothly instead of accidentally tapping.- They have a hard time switching between phone calls and other audio on my pixel 7 pro. For example, if I'm listening to Spotify and answer a call, when I get off the call and start my music again, it will go through my phone speaker instead of the earbuds. This is despite them still showing up as connected and the touch controls still controlling the audio on the phone. Nothing I do except for putting the buds back in the case and taking them out again will get the music to come through the buds again. Sometimes the inverse happens, where I'll try to make a phone call and the audio won't come through the earbuds at all, even though it shows they're connected. Trying to manually toggle the phone call audio to Bluetooth from my phone will show Bluetooth as selected for a moment, then toggle back to phone audio, almost like it tried and failed to use the buds for audio.- Sometimes they seem to glitch and cause audio to be garbled and fade out for a second or two when noise cancelling is on.- There is no way they actually have 7 hours of battery life with noise cancelling on. I'd say it's more like 5.- You can't ring them to find them if they're in the case.

And these earbuds just suck. My biggest complaints:- Horribly designed. Now I understand why Apple went with the ""stalks"" for their earbud design; I accidentally trigger these Pixel Buds ALL THE TIME. The slightest touch causes them to pause/resume, which gets extremely annoying when I'm working outside, my hands are filthy, I don't want to touch them, and I accidentally brush up against them while wiping my forehead. They really are an incredible nuisance in this regard, and I honestly have no idea how they made it past user testing.- Autoconnect is abysmal. I have these paired with all of my devices, and of the hundreds of times I've tried to connect to one by taking them out of the case, the Pixel Buds have managed to connect to the device I wanted them to (i.e., the *active* device) maybe 5 times.- Distortion/garbled sound. Not sure what causes this, but I have to disconnect and reconnect periodically to whichever device I'm using because the sound suddenly becomes distorted and full of strange audio artifacts, and only a reconnect fixes the issue. This happens almost every time I connect to my laptop, and pretty regularly when connecting to my phone.- Fit is significantly worse, no matter which of the included tips I use. Jaw movements like yawning or chewing routinely make these fall out, as I unhappily discovered one day while yawning on the toilet.Coming from the Airpods, these things are just a massive pain. I recently bought a cheap pair of slim bluetooth earbuds for $25 that I vastly prefer, even though their sound quality is significantly worse.

Their design not only feels uncomfortable during prolonged use, but also seems prone to slipping out, making them a frustrating accessory during workouts or even casual strolls. It's evident that the design was not thoroughly thought out for varying ear shapes and sizes.Lastly, the price tag is the nail in the coffin.

3.0,Not worthy as replacement for the Life A1 as workout earbud,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LMAGEFHCLVDP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023",2023-11-26,United States,,"As mentioned, I am trying the Liberty 3 Pro as possible upgrade to my current Soundcore Life A1. My primary use is for working out/exercising (strength training, treadmills, jogging, biking, etc.).  I've been watching the L3P for a while and got it at a discounted price during Black Friday.So comparing the L3P to the A1:SOUND QUALITY: the L3P has a noticeable better sound quality than the A1 right out of the box. It has a lot of sound presets via the mobile app and you can customize your own EQ as well as ANC (active noise cancelling).  That does not mean the A1 has bad sound quality though. Once you start listening to music you just get used to it. You will only really notice the quality difference if switching back and forth from one to another.SOUND VOLUME: the A1 seems to be louder than the L3P. Ex: I'd need to change the Spotify normalization setting to LOUD for the L3P to match the A1 max volume, but that would compromise sound quality so it wouldn't make sense and we don't want to go deaf anyways. In any case, the L3P is loud enough... it's just something I've noticed.CONTROLS/BUTTONS: the L3P has touch sensitive ""buttons"" while the A1 has physical buttons. My first workout test was running on the treadmill at the gym and while the L3P is easier to tap, it is also very prone to accidental taps. I've had multiple accidental single-taps (changes volume) while wiping sweat with a hand towel during the workout and even had a couple of accidental double-taps (skips/pauses) as well. That does not happen with the A1 since it has physical buttons that need to be actually pressed. I give the A1 a win on this aspect.SIZE/FIT: the L3P is a little smaller than the A1 even with the largest ""earwings"" and ""eartips"" but stayed secure on my ears during exercise. I specifically need earbuds with earwings because other models without them don't really stay put on my ears (everyone has different ear shapes!). I could never wear the Samsung Buds for example.NOISE (CANCELLATION): The L3P have ANC while the A1 does not, but still, the L3Ps are earbuds (as opposed to full around-the-ears headsets) and the ANC is less than perfect and you can still hear background noise.  The A1 does not have ANC but due to it's size being a little bigger, it fits a little more snug on my ears and the ""passive"" sound isolation is still good (more on this in the next point).SHAPE/WIND NOISE: The second test was a bike ride and right away I've noticed that the L3P is very susceptible to wind noise due to it's shape, kind like a little mushroom sticking out of the ear, while the A1 is very aerodynamic and sits almost entirely hidden in the external ear canal. The L3P shape together with the smaller size and slight loose fit compared to the A1 makes it very noisy in windy situations.  I actually had to pull over and go on the phone app to turn on the ANC and there is even a toggle to ""reduce wind speed"" so I guess this lack of aerodynamics was a known factor for the L3P.  That was a big surprise to me since I never had, or at least had not noticed, wind noise issues with the A1.  So my ~2hr bike ride with ANC on drained about 40% of the battery, in line with the estimated ~5hrs total duration with ANC on which would be ok for me but not for an all-day-use situation.  The A1 is estimated to last ~6-7hrs on a single charge so, for my particular use case, the A1 is also a winner here.MIC: I didn't test the mic quality myself but I saw other review videos and the L3P definitely has better mic quality for anyone using it for calls.  I rarely ever use the A1 for calls but I know it works ok from the few times it happened.In conclusion, for my particular use case as workout/exercise earbuds, I'm sticking to the A1 mostly because of the touch sensitivity and wind noise issue of the L3P.  If I was using earbuds mostly at home or office, or a somewhat noisy environment/situation that required ANC, I think I'd keep the L3P.  Keep in mind all of these factors can be different from person to person because of ear shapes.",True,Color: Midnight Black,[],1.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,920.0,500.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3
3.0,Despite very “painful experience” Anker’s still #1 in for great buds! Ears bleeding from earwigs,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HH79A4AVER94/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023",2023-11-22,United States,,"I was literally sitting in the living room staring out the window waiting to test out my new soundcore liberty 3 pro earbuds because when it’s coming from Anker, you can believe that your mind will be blown away. Well, it was as I had imagined. Had a rough start. The outer box was all banged up and when I opened the box I wasn’t very pleased with what I saw. The earbuds were indeed in the box, that said there was no, zero bubble wrap or any cushioning to protect the box at all. Oddly, they were protruding halfway up the box and had an overwhelming amount of dust and debris on the packaging. I have pictures if I can find out how to upload them but that aside, the earbuds didn’t seem to be damaged so I was feeling a little better, I’ve only used them 3 times since they arrived because of the extremely painful experience with trying the ear tips and wigs. As luck would have it, I found some that had a tight seal so I was able to setup the earbuds which were as simple as snapping your finger. I listened to a wide variety of different music, watched a movie and a couple of amine episodes, not to mention trying out the app and every feature/EQ preset. I mean, it’s Anker so right out of the box the signature sound is something you can admire. You have about 20 different EQ settings for any genre or podcast you could ever want and on top of that you have more custom made EQ adjustments from Grammy award winning song writers and I found one that was the perfect harmony of mids, lows and just the right amount of bass. The 3D surround sound is mind blowing and I must admit that coming from someone who has been an Apple fanboy since the OG iPhone, and even owning every single iPhone model, size and color there are. Including AirPods, Apple Watches etc. I assure you that whenever you listen to what the soundcore liberty 3 pro has to offer, you’ll be asking yourself why you ever spent all that money for a set of Apple AirPods. I have absolutely zero to say negatively about the sound quality, ANC and ambient modes. The call quality is on par with the most elite headphones on the market for a fraction of the price. I’m sad to say that I have owned and have spent over $600 on Anker products in an 18 month span. The Anker MagSafe compatible chargers, miniature 30W charging block and I’m still using the 10ft. Braided lightning cable that I’ve had since the iPhone 13 Pro was released. But no company is perfect and I don’t think any less of Anker nor do I blame them for my 3 bad experiences with their products. The only negative feedback I have for these earbuds are that I have very strange ear canals and though I had tried every single earbud tip and the wing tip that was offered. The buds were so amazing I decided to just wing it out (no pun intended lol) to see if I could break them in. Unfortunately, not only did they not conform with my ears but they also bruised up and slightly scratched my ears and even now I’m in agonizing pain. I love music and I love Anker for producing various products that I love, enjoy and actually are keeping me somewhat sane in the current situation me and my family are having to face.. so I apologize for the long winded review. I think 3 somewhat bad or more disappointing product purchases is actually very impressive and I will still continue to purchase and endorse my friends at Anker for making such affordable yet revolutionary technology that has become a staple in my life. To the potential customers who actually have taken the time to read this review, there’s not even a sliver of a chance that you will have this experience with these amazing earbuds. I’m just one of the most unlucky people on the planet and please do give these beautiful earbuds a try and listen for yourself or you may end up regretting it down the line. I’m very limited on money and I didn’t want to spend what little I have on some no-name earbuds that talk big but never back it up. Anker soundcore liberty 3 pro is not that kind of earbud. These are among the top 3 most impressive earbuds I’ve ever owned and trust me, I’ve been through a lot of them. I give Anker my stamp of approval and if anyone knows me that’s a very difficult feat lol. I pray I can find some that I can use that will be as amazing and memorable as these are. I’m sorry to the hardworking community of Anker if I have come off as rude. I will continue to use Anker throughout my life and I hope that you won’t view me any differently because of this. That’s all I’ve got.

3.0,"Great in some ways, not in others",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N5VPY6UXTDDF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,51 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2022",2022-11-27,United States,,"I've been using these as my only ear buds for the past 6 months.  I use them on average 2 hours a day; sometimes for 4 hours or more.  There are some  features that are worth considering on these earbuds, and some things that make me want to purchase another brand.SoundThese earbuds sound great.  The bass is strong when it needs to be, but not overwhelming at all.  I listen to jazz, funk, and pop/rock from the 70s and 80s.  The HearID Sound Test within the app customizes the equalizer separately for each ear and the resulting sound is much better for me than the default sound profile.  In the past I've used Pixel Buds (the original, not the Pro), Pixel Buds A, and Sony Linkbuds.  Anker sounds better than any of those, in my opinion.Phone CallsI make a few phone calls every day on my earbuds and one of the reasons I selected these is for their phone call quality.  I often make calls using these buds while driving.  Some of the people I talk with will not hesitate to tell me if my voice quality sucks (they have said so with other devices).  No one has ever complained about voice quality using the Soundcore 3 Pro buds.  My voice is always clear, even when I am in noisy environments.  These buds outperform much more expensive buds like the Sony MX4 and Boise Quiet Comfort buds for phone calls in noisy environments, at least according to the Youtube reviews I've seen.  The higher end buds don't focus on phone calls as much, apparently.ANCThis is the first ANC capable device I have used, but it seems to work well for me.  It blocks much, but not all, outside noise.  I have flown with these earbuds and find that I am more relaxed on the plane.  I guess the jet engine noise causes me low-level anxiety which I was unaware of.  On a long drive with my two adult sons, I eventually needed a break from their music.  I put in my buds with ANC on and found peace.  It was wonderful.Touch ControlsThe touch controls are one of the most disappointing features, especially after using two models of Google Pixel buds.  It often doesn't pick up on my touches. I can customize the touches, but the customization only works when I have both buds in.  When I'm using only one bud, which I often do when listening to podcasts, the touch controls revert back to the default, which is annoying.  Also, when I take a bud out of my ear, it is supposed to stop the music.  It does for a second, but if I'm holding my bud in my hand, it thinks it's back in my ear.  When I'm on a walk and stop to talk to a neighbor, I would like to remove one bud and have a conversation.  But the music starts again soon after in the other ear.CaseThe case serves its purpose, but I have a very difficult time getting my average-sized (male) fingers in to pull out the earbuds.  More on that later.Ear WingsThis is my other big frustration with these buds.  Over time, the ear wings get loose and start to slide around, not staying put on the earbud, making for a poor fit.  No other manufacturer that I am aware of uses ear wings.  They are not a plus.  I've found on the Soundcore website where I can order replacement ear wings, but it says they are sold out.  I'm currently using the next larger size, which decreases comfort.I think one of the reasons I have problems with the ear wings is that I can't get my fingers into the case to grab the buds.  I end up grabbing an ear wing instead.  I usually grab the right bud first, and the ear wing on that earbud is very loose (the left one doesn't slip around near as much).  Once I get the right bud out of the case, it's easier to get the left one out without having to grab the ear wing.  If you purchase these, I suggest you stick your finger between the buds in the case and 'push' them out rather than trying to grab them.  I believe it will allow the ear wings to last longer.BatteryI've almost never run low on battery for the buds.  Wearing them 2 to 4 hours at a time, they have plenty of battery.Software AppThe app on my Android phone works well.  There are some features that are confusing or hard to find, but overall it's a good app.  You can take the custom sound profile it creates for you and alter it (more bass, different music styles, etc), but that function is not intuitive to find in the app.Overall, a great pair of ear buds.  If I could get replacement ear wings, I would be a  lot happier.  If I can't, I may need to purchase another brand.",True,Color: Midnight Black,[],3.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,920.0,500.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3
3.0,Best sounding earbuds I have ever used but with many annoyances,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCDNQRIHHMPH1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2023",2023-12-07,United States,,"Pros:- These sound incredible, rivaling even high dollar wired earbuds. I am amazed at how good these sound.- The case is really neat.- Bluetooth setup is a breeze.- Ambience mode is excellent, allowing me to clearly hear my coworkers while listening to music.- Comes with a large assortment of various sized tips and wings.- The soundcore app has a lot of useful features and amazing customization options.- Decent battery life.Cons:- The most annoying con is the inconsistency in the volume. The volume is fine when you first use them but after putting them in the case for a period of time the volume level will be much quieter. The device volume level will not have changed but the earbuds are noticeably much quieter. The only way to fix this is to have the volume assigned to a double tap gesture on the earbud and max it and then adjust the level on the device to the appropriate level.- The left earbud randomly stops working at times until I put them both back in the case.- The noise canceling is almost non-existent.- The earbuds seem to randomly pause for no reason. I use these at work for a few hours each day, off and on, and they pause about 3 or so times randomly.- Even though these come with an assortment of tips and wings I can't seem to find a perfect fit.

They're fiddly to fit and insert. Their performance is inconsistent. The sensitivity to touch, issues with charging in the case, unwanted connectivity, and general gremlins with using them has really destroyed any enthusiasm I had when I first bought them.Let's start with the minor quibbles, shall we? Typically, I'm a more options kinda person. While I appreciate the many options for fit, I found all of the various combos of ear tips and wings to be a bit much when first approaching the buds and establishing what fit and seal should be without actually knowing what they should sound like. I've had them fall out gradually slip from my ears while on my walks.Major complaints:1. Sensitivity. The earbuds are much too sensitive to touch. While inserting or adjusting them, these touches constantly affect the operation of the bud(s): pausing, changing volume, skipping through audiobook chapters. Once they come out of the case they're connecting. And ready to party.2. Charging in the case. I can have charged the case overnight, but when I go to insert them, one will have a very low charge or will be completely dead. The case will show fully charged. So how?3. Functionality of the case and connectivity. Okay, here we go. When closed, the case should be charging the buds. When the lid is closed, nothing should be connected to ANYTHING. Closing the case should disconnect any devices, right? But no. I'll have music playing from some mysterious source: not my phone, not my watch, not my iPad... Yes, my iPad that I almost never ever use with the earbuds. It's like once you disconnect from one device, it just cycles through to the next device. This may also contribute to the low battery issue because one earbud is discharged and has been defiantly transmitting.I've examined the contact points in the case and made sure that the lights are on for each bud and close the case and they'll STILL answer my phone or disconnect my call when I close the case to switch to another option for handling the call.I've really wanted these to work, but they just don't. I let the return window close believing that it was user error, but so many reviews and Reddit posts mention the same troubles that I have. The ANC is pretty good, when I'm out walking, I have some level of transparency on.These should be amazing earbuds with seamless wireless listening, a great case for charging and using the buds independently of the other, and a great seal for excellent listening. They aren't. Notice I haven't talked about listening?

The case itself is far less ""premium"" feeling, especially compared to the earbuds themselves.* I love how easy it is to swap ear tips. They are notched to ensure a specific attachment depth, which ensures that the frequency response remains relatively consistent when swapping out ear tips.* I like that these earbuds have ear wings.  They definitely help the earbuds feel more secure and encourage the ear tips to retain their seal.  There 3 alternative size options: 2 smaller and 1 much larger option.  I do wish there was a 5th size option, midway between the largest and the default size.  The execution of the ear wings themselves is not great though, see below.* The ANC is surprisingly decent for this price-point.  Don't expect any miracles, but it does made a substantial difference over the passive noise cancellation provided by the ear tips alone.  I was surprised to find that enabling ANC noticeably alleviates the sensation of having your ears plugged by the ear tips.* Transparency mode works better than expected for this price point, and has a ""voices only"" mode* ANC has a ""wind"" mode, which helps (but does not completely eliminate) wind noise, which is otherwise exacerbated by ANC.* The earbuds are capable of HD streaming via LDAC, though this needs to be explicitly enabled via a specific firmware version available through the Soundcore app.  Unfortunately, this is also a negative, see below.* The default battery life is excellent, so long as you do not enable LDAC, see below.* Once drained, the earbuds recharge very quickly.* Soundcore actively maintains its app and device firmwareNegatives, but with workarounds:* The default touch controls are not very intuitive.  Fortunately, the app allows you to completely customize them, allowing different controls for each side, as well as enable single and triple tap gestures, which are disabled by default.* The default tuning (i.e. frequency response) is very V shaped, and not my ideal.  In general, the bass is very impressive with good extension, but is overly emphasized, while the treble has some harsh peaks.  Thankfully, an AutoEQ profile for these earbuds exists (via the Wavelet app on Android devices), which successfully tames the tuning to align with the Harmon curve.  Once the AutoEQ convolution is applied, these earbuds sound really nice.Negatives:* The ear wings have an annoying tendency to slide out of place once you twist the earbuds into your ears (as instructed).  I do wish these would snap into (and stay in) place the way that the ear tips do.  The worse side-effect is that  once the ear wings slide out of place, they will cover up the wearing sensor, which can cause music to auto-play.  The only workaround I have found is to completely disable wear detection. Additionally, I find that I need to readjust the ear wings after every use, otherwise the earbuds will not fit back into the case.* The latency, while not terrible, is too high to comfortably watch videos or play games.  Frankly, I do not understand why so few TWS manufacturers support AptX Adaptive, since most already rely on Qualcomm chips for bluetooth.* When streaming music via LDAC, my sound cuts out far too frequently (at least every 5 minutes), even though my source device is nearby and unobstructed.  While the situation might improve with future firmware updates, the fact that this issue is still so problematic in 2022, even though these earbuds were released in 2021, is very concerning.* Some features (e.g. multipoint) are not available when using LDAC.* Using LDAC burns through the battery very quickly, especially when used in conjunction with ANC or transparency mode.  On a full charge, I was only able to play music at a normal volume for 2 hours before receiving the ""battery low"" notification.  This is very disappointing, given that these earbuds advertise 8 hours of battery life on a single change with ANC off and 6 hours with ANC on.In summary, there is a lot to love about these earbuds, but, for me at least, the issues with the ear wings and LDAC implementation are insurmountable.

The earbuds have a nice scope of delivery.2. The sound quality is great and on par with the latest Air Pods (2023).3. The earbuds are comfortable to wear.4. HearID helps to adjust the EQ, which is a huge plus.5. The price is totally worth it at $80.Cons:1. Color... I wanted grey or white earbuds, that's why I bought Fog Grey which looks whitish in the pictures. What I received was more like baby blue. I mean, they are not just don't look like in the pictures, but they are not grey at all. Not even remotely (see picture).2. Noise cancelation is not great. I used HearID and tried multiple ear tips but it was still pretty mediocre. Not a problem for me, since I don't care much about it, but if this is the reason why you buy them - it might not work for you well.3. Battery doesn't show the percentage in the app (just a battery icon with bars), so you have no idea how much exactly charge you have.4. Sometimes it is not possible to switch between noise-canceling options during a call via messenger applications, although it is possible through the app. Additionally, each time the earbuds are disconnected, noise canceling automatically goes into ""normal"" mode instead of the one that you chose.All in all, yes, they are a great value (if they are on sale for $80), but there are some issues that are fixable (if the manufacturer will want to), and I'd totally love them if they'd be as they are on the picture, but they literally have color that I don't like most.I'd probably buy the white one instead of what they call grey (which is clearly blue), but they are more expensive, so they no longer have that great value.I spoke with Soundcore CS to ask why the grey is blue, and they offered to buy another color and they'll match the price (15% discount) but I must do it through their website, while I prefer Amazon.",True,Color: Fog Gray,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615CUR0cyfL._SY88.jpg'],8.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,920.0,500.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3
3.0,"Mixed feelings, I somewhat recommend",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IWM0AREN9PBP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2022",2022-04-23,United States,,"I've had these earbuds for five or six months and there have been a few ups and downs. Overall, these are good. The sound quality if phenomenal and hard to beat. Not just for the price, but period. I'm currently testing out some more expensive earbuds, the Beats Fit Pro, and those sound great but the Liberty 3 Pros are clearly better. As is typical with Anker/Soundcore, you get a lot of bang for your buck. The sound settings and HearID functions are great. A physical button is a bit easier to use, but these touch controls work fairly well. You get ANC and Transparency. I don't really use ANC, but I use transparency/ambient mode a lot. It works, but is definitely not best in class. I can hear folks around me, but there have been times when I still feel compelled to take the earbuds out to still hear someone. For comparison, the Beats Fit Pros make me forget they're there and I have yet to feel the need to take them out to hear clearly when in transparency mode. You also get LDAC and multi-point pairing. LDAC to me doesn't make much of a difference and the multi-point pairing is really cool and convenient at times, but I wouldn't be bothered if it wasn't a feature.So you get all of these great things for much cheaper than the competitors, what the problem? If it sounds to good to be true, it likely is. There are some concessions to be made in order to deliver all that with immense cost savings. The biggest way that shows up for me is that the connectivity is a bit janky. The audio often drops out at times, especially if I'm out and about. Soundcore will say that's because you're using LDAC mode which messes up connectivity in order to deliver the higher quality audio. However, I don't use LDAC mode and still have these issues and have seen other people with the same complaint. Also, the earbuds don't always connect properly when taking them out of the case. Sometimes one bud won't connect and I have to put them back in the case and pull them back out. Furthermore, when putting the buds in the case to charge/turn them off, it does not always work. This mostly seems to be an issue with the right bud. I will set it in the case and the magnets snap in, but for some reason it does not register that the bud is there, which leaves it on/connected. For a while I did not realize this was happening so I would have times where I would miss texts/calls because my phone wouldn't ring out loud because it's still connected to the earbud. Also, depending on the length between usage, I would go to put the buds in for a workout or something and they battery would be completely drained. Now that I'm aware of this issue, I pay closer attention to this and at least half of the time I have to fiddle with the earbud until it registers that it's in the case. Also, I've gone back and forth a bit with Soundcore on these issues and I'm on my 3rd pair and the problems still persist. So I know it's not a situation where I received a defective pair.Overall, the price, audio quality and features makes me want to highly recommend these buds. However, the connectivity issues makes it hard for me to do it. If you think you're fine with the connectivity issues, then by all means, check them out. I've mostly been able to make due with the jank because I love the audio quality so much, but it can get pretty annoying. I've had much cheaper earbuds that don't have those issues. They're also quite bulky in my opinion, so that's another thing. Maybe if they drop LDAC and multi-point to make room in the budget for a more stable connection and smaller build quality, I would find these near perfect.",True,Color: Frost White,[],9.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,920.0,500.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

I use them individually, mainly for hands-free calls. I wear one in the morning (~6-11:30AM), usually the left, and I get a low battery warning shortly before lunch. Then swap them and wear the other for the remainder of the day. As for the fit, ugh. The removable rubber ""wings"" that supposedly ""lock"" the earbud in place in the ear is too soft and pliable. They are easily dislodged from their positioning notches making constant readjustment necessary throughout the day.

I managed to lose one after only having them for a few days. I think it could be because the case bowl not stay closed if you have a silicone cover on it and carry it using a carabiner. I ended up buying g a zipper case for these, which is perfect because it will also hold the charger cord.I love that the de ear buds come with so many sizes of ear pieces and ear wings to make them fit your specific ear. They’re the only buds I’ve ever had that reliably stay in my ears where they belong. The sounds is amazing, the app is amazing. I don’t like that they don’t always stay connected to my iPhone when I take a call though. If I switch to a different screen while taking a call, they often disconnected. It is super frustrating. I love that they always reliably connect to my iPhone when I first start to use them and they also reliably connect to my computer. I love that I can have my ear buds connected to my iPhone and work computer or work phone at the same time!! Now I can listen to music or podcast from my phone with ear buds (and excellent noise cancellation) and easily answer a call from my computer or work cell phone (depending on which I have connected). Absolute game changer.I wish there were more control options, but overall they are a bargain price for a reliable set of ear buds and they don’t break the bank if you happen to need to replace them.If you lose one though, you can’t connect it to a new device. You have to have both to be able to connect to a new device. Since I lost one ear bud on my original set, I am only able to use it on my work or personal iPhones, not my laptop anymore. Still happy to be able to have it as a back up though.Also, if you drop them back into their case for like 10 min, you get an extra 4 hours of charge!

However, my Galaxy buds pro kept falling out of my ears while talking and they caused ear pain if I wore them for over an hour.Bought these Soundcore L3Ps to replace the Galaxy buds pros. Wow, at the price of $130, the L3Ps provide amazing value! Since I have the L3Ps and the Galaxy buds pros, I am going to do a comparison review.Comfort/fit:The L3Ps win hands down. Galaxy buds pro causes ear pain for me, and they fall out if I talk. I tried yawning and the L3Ps stayed in securely.Sound quality:The L3Ps has a more interesting sound profile with more bass and more treble out of the box. The Galaxy buds pros sound more neutral. The L3Ps respond to EQ much better than the Galaxy buds. I EQed the L3Ps to be more neutral, and they sound less muddy compared to the Galaxy buds. Both had impressive sound quality as Bluetooth ear buds.ANC:Both provided satisfactory ANC. Galaxy ANC seems slightly better.Battery life:Don't know yet, haven't gotten a chance to run them out of juice.With ANC off, used for 45 mins and battery went from 100% to 90%.Connection:L3Ps have multipoint connection and I love it. Galaxy buds pro doesn't have it.I noticed my L3Ps dropped connection once or twice so far. Music stops for about half a second and immediately resumes. Happened twice in a few hours so far.For some reason, my Galaxy buds pro sounded better when connected to my Android phone, but slightly worse when connected to my Macbook Pro (and the Galaxy buds were not in headset mode.) The L3Ps sounded great regardless whether I play music from my phone or Macbook.LDAC:Turning on LDAC would cause the L3Ps to lose multipoint connections. I tried LDAC mode and the improvement in sound quality is noticeable but not big enough for me to give up on multipoint connections.HearID:I preferred a more neutral sound, but the HearID ear tests made the sound even less neutral. I would say I don't like it.(Update: after trying the HearID sound for a few hours, I must say that it sounded really good! It was a unique sound profile that takes some time to get used to. Now I am surprised how good the HearID sound profile is--the more I listened to it, the more I liked it.)Other factors:I like the Galaxy buds pro's talk detection, which turns on ambient mode and lowers music volume if I start speaking--e.g., super convenient for talking to cashiers at supermarkets. L3Ps don't have this feature.The ambient mode on the Galaxy buds pro is more customizable and feels better.I don't like the Soundcore logo--the logo looked like Beats knockoff?!Quality (or feel):Both have great build quality.The Galaxy charging case feels more premium to me and is also more compact.The L3Ps have a more premium packaging.Overall, I preferred the Galaxy charging case.For me the main deciding factors are:1. Fit.2. Multipoint connection.Update: 3.

They were both budget earbuds. The last pair I had were actually pretty good, but when I dropped the case, that wasn't waterproof (I don't think this case is either) in water, they wouldn't charge anymore, so I had to look for another pair.The start of my search:I tried 5 different sets of earbuds before settling on these. The first 3 sets I tried caused my pain in my ears after only a few minutes of use.Liberty 2 pro:The 4th pair I tried were the Liberty 2 pro Earbuds. Those earbuds were so far the best sounding earbuds I had used. The bass is great, which is something I find a lot of earbuds lack. I had to try out several different sizes of tips to get them to fit comfortably, but I did find a good set. Fortunately they came with a lot so I could find a good fit.I did like that the Liberty 2 Pro has buttons on the side of the earbud so you don't jam them into your when you use them, but it inevitably causes them to shift when you push the button which can affect sound quality and comfort.My main issue with them was that they protrude from my ears a lot and I was concerned that when I cut the grass and wore my ear muffs, they would get jammed into my ears. So I kept looking and saw that there was a new generation of Liberty Pro earbuds, the Liberty 3 Pros.Liberty 3 Pro:I decided to give the Liberty 3 Pros a try because they were smaller than the Liberty 2 Pros, have ANC, and touch controls. One pair I had tried before had ANC and it was a nice feature to have. These fit great straight out of the box! I think the lower profile makes them more comfortable, so I didn't need to change tips to make them fit better.They manage to improve on the GREAT sound of the Liberty 2 Pro. These are take the sound to another level. It could be because of the ANC, but I'm not sure. All I know is that they sound amazing. The ANC also sort of puts me in my own world where most background noise is blocked out and I can ignore distractions.My only issue is that touch controls aren't the most reliable. I appreciate that they are touch instead of button controls. They don't move around when you use the controls. However, the double tap feature has to be tried 2 or 3 times before it registers that I wasn't trying to single tap twice in succession rather than doing a double tap. There's also an option for triple tap, but I can't even imagine trying to get that to work. It would probably be best if you set the controls so that single tap and tap and hold are your primary functions, as those work the best.They take a little while to set up with the HearID equalizer, but it's worth taking the few minutes to get that done.Summary:If you're looking for lower profile earbuds with superior sound, great comfort, ANC, and touch controls, I wound definitely recommend these.",True,Color: Midnight Black,[],3.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,6392.0,1910.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

5.0,"Lots of hype, but they are really good when you customize them",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14KREK2DF11S8?ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,323 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021",2021-10-29,United States,,"UPDATE I:Another Firmware release has addressed the Transparency Mode to make it sound almost as if there's no buds in your ears.  Not super hearing, but very natural.  I now rate the Transparency mode at 9/10..UPDATE II:I finally got an email from Soundcore after a 10 day wait.  However, they said had sent me two previous emails in response to my initial email and a follow-up.  Someone online mentioned they had all Soundcore's email get sent to the Spam folder.  I checked mine and there they were!  I let Soundcore know and they admitted they were working on a solution.  That seems to work OK now, at least for me.  Soundcore got me new buds within 4 business days of me getting that last email and a postage paid USPS label to return the old ones for investigation.  I now rate Soundcore Warranty support at 10/10..UPDATE III:SINGLE BUD USE: 7/10While I do not typically use one earbud, if you do you'll find the functionality becomes minimal.  The app limits itself to just the left or right bud control customization and that's it.  No ANC or Transparency modes.  It sounds like the bud does go into Mono mode.  The remaining customizations are to choose for the single, double, triple and tap / hold controls either Play/pause, Next, Previous Vol +/- and Voice assistant.I would have liked for ANC to be available in the remaining bud, but I understand Soundcore's logic...UPDATE IV:I found the frequency response for the L3P online and it's clear why these are so bright at the top end and need taming.  Fortunately the treble reproduction is so good that you can use the response to get the excellent clarity without being too harsh.  After several weeks of listening to these and comparing to other BT buds and wired IEM's I altered my EQ setting to get the best clarity and bass for all genres.  I've uploaded that in place of my original.  These are still the best value with the best sound, even compared with Sennheiser MTW2 and the Sony XM3 IMHO.......ORIGINAL REVIEW:TLDR warning!I’m an ‘audiophile’, but only in the sense that I ‘love’ to listen to all genres of ‘high-quality music/sound’ files with Bluetooth earbuds in a quiet, dark room and enjoy the musical arrangements as the producer intended.  I also listen to music when working hard in the garden or the house!  I have earbuds in my ears for hours every day.I’ve tried many TWS earbuds over the last few months and they all have their strengths and weaknesses, but none hit all the bars, whether it be fit, comfort, sound quality, app customization, retention, ANC modes, price, value for money, warranty support, etc.  You always have to choose what’s most important to you and go with the buds that meet those criteria.  Trouble is, everyone is different and what suits your ears and hearing may be completely the opposite for someone else.  So, this review is for my ears and may be the same for you, but maybe not.I’ve had these L3P’s for over two weeks, having bought them the day they launched and having watched the overblown YT video hype released the morning of that launch.  I specifically bought Prime ‘Free Return’ buds as the reviews sounded too good to be true and it was interesting that Soundcore sent out so much free product to all the reviewers.  There was a clear marketing strategy in play!As it turns out, the hype was 75% true IMHO.CASE 7/10 :The sliding lid and overall case shape is a unique design but doesn’t suit my dry hands.  It’s easily dropped.  I also struggle with knowing which direction to slide the lid as the Soundcore logo is not intuitive to me.  There is a ledge at the front of the lid, but easily missed.  The earbuds also fit in an odd orientation and it takes a while to learn how best to drop them in quickly.  The magnets are strong enough and I can use my fingertip on the wing to get the buds out of the case, whereas my SoundPEATS Air 3 are almost impossible to get out of their case!  To me though it’s just a case.  I don’t care as long as it fits in a pocket.FIT  9/10 :I’ve not used earbuds with wings before. My ear canals point upwards into my head, so stem style buds don’t work for me, unless the stems are pointed up at 11 and 1 o’clock, as I discovered with the Edifier Neobuds Pro.  My button style buds, like the SoundPEATS H1, typically fit nice and deep in my ear canals with smaller tips and only touch my ears via the tips.  I struggle if the design doesn’t allow for the deep insertion to lock the buds in place.The L3P is not a deep insertion design.  So, the tip must seal and lock into the outer ear for me.  The largest of the L3P wings aren’t actually big enough for my ears.  They don’t reach the cartilage when the bud is in the attitude that Soundcore suggests.  After much experience of loosening with many combos, I finally found the right combination.  Actually, my ears require different combos of wing and tip left and right, but I found a smaller wing and bigger tip worked best, with the buds angled almost horizontally in my ear.  Now I have a pair that is comfortable for more than 5 hours, or when the battery runs out (see below about that!).  Consequently, these are probably the most comfortable buds I’ve used.TOUCH CONTROLS 9/10 :I MUST, MUST, MUST have volume control on any ear buds, but I also look for total control as a secondary requirement.  These have it all, similar to the SoundPEATS products.  1 tap, 2 taps, 3 taps, tap and hold.  Each earbud can be set up with whatever function you want.  Also, you can disable each individually if you wish.  I found adjusting the buds a lot in the early days kept changing the single tap volume I’d set up.  I disabled 1-tap functionality and solved that problem!My configuration is…1-Tap: disabled2-Tap: Left Volume down, Right Volume upTap and Hold: Left ANC/Transparency/Normal mode, Right Pause/Play3-Tap: Left Previous track/Restart track, Right Next TrackThe touch controls do need some work.  Once you get used to the speed of taps for multiples, the controls work almost flawlessly.  I have dry hands and sometimes, the touch doesn’t register.  Only 1 in 10 times maybe though.  The real problem is the feedback timing… touch, volume changes, beeps sound.  I’d much rather have… touch, beeps, volume change.Also, the three ANC modes are each indicated by a different tone.  While you learn which is which over time, when any music is playing, it can be difficult to hear and know which tone sounded and hence which mode you selected.  A voice prompt would solve that issue in a heartbeatBATTERY LIFE 6/10 :Battery life is not really an issue for me but could be for those who use their buds at work during the whole day.  I haven’t checked the ANC off, LDAC off maximum battery life.  I have run to almost dead with ANC/Transparency mode on, LDAC off and I got just under 6 hours.  With ANC mode on and LDAC on I got under 4 hours!  Considering the size of the buds, you’d think they could fit a larger capacity battery in there.APP FUNCTIONALITY/CUSTOMIZATION 10/10 :This is one of the main attractions for the L3P.  You won’t get a more featured app than Sony’s, but this pretty much beats all in this price range and above.  The Sennheiser Momentum TW 2 app is pretty good but doesn’t have the HearID technology or the number of EQ sliders/presets.  I had BT connection issues with the MTW2 and the app.  The L3P is flawless.  It connects every time I open the app.  Firmware updates are pretty fast (just a handful of minutes) compared with the 50 mins for the MTW2!  The EQ customization capability is what saves the L3P (see below for that).What I would like to see is an option to pause music when selecting Transparency.  Very often, I only need Transparency when I need to talk with someone and I have to make two ‘Tap and Hold’ actions to get there.ANC  9/10, TRANSPARENCY 6/10 (See Update above) :To my ears, the ANC is very good.  Of course, the seal in your ears is absolutely critical and that gives a lot of passive noise cancellation also.  Sometimes, I have to insert the buds a couple times to get the seal to work correctly.  I don’t really have an issue with cabin pressure.  So, the adaptive ANC isn’t needed and I like a STRONG manual ANC setting.  I would say the ANC is on par with the Edifier Neobuds Pro, which claims a > 40dB reduction.  Certainly, better than the SoundPEATS T2, but not as good as the Sony XM4.  The sounds you hear are in the upper frequency range with few mids left.  I have used these with my garden rototiller and only needed to bump up the volume by one click.  For mowing though, I add my ANC Q30 over the ear headphones over the top of the L3P with ANC, so I don’t need to bump up the volume at all.  I also use ANC when eating as it reduces the conducted sounds in your head!  There’s no significant ANC hiss with the L3P.  MY MTW2’s hissed all the time in any mode!  Normal mode has a deep bass rumble, which is from inside my head.  ANC eliminates that, which is why I often use it even in quiet places.I did find I got a better ANC performance using a NY street sound at full volume on my computer speakers during the HearID ANC testing.  Using airplane cabin noise, brown noise or my rototiller, the resulting ANC didn’t seem as good.Transparency mode works but is still reducing the background noise. You don’t have super hearing, or even normal hearing.  I tried it in my truck and Transparency muted the noise level a lot over no earbuds . It works OK for a conversation and you can hear your own voice, but just a little, but it could be better.  My MTW2 sounded like I had no buds in at all.The Vocal Mode and Wind Noise Reduction options don’t seem to do much.CALL QUALITY TBD :I have yet to use these on any calls.  I will update the review when I have.SOUND QUALITY - out of the box 1/10, with EQ customization 8.5/10 :Here’s where the reviewers went wrong IMHO.  To be fair, some actually mentioned the highs were a little too sibilant and very subtly mentioned that app EQ customization will counter that, but most said these buds sounded awesome as-is.  NO, THEY DO NOT!  Out of the box, I found the sound quality was incredibly thin, sibilant in the extreme and harsh on the ears.  These reminded me of the Edifier NB2 and Neobuds Pro sound profiles, but much worse. The former had no app support to adjust the sound and immediately got returned.  The Neobuds could be tamed nicely, but I couldn’t get the stem style to seal reliably.I spent several days going through my 70-plus Earbud Test Tracks playlist on Amazon Music, trying to find one EQ that would work for all. Eventually I found it.  It’s funny that when I went back though the Soundcore presets, I found the DEEP preset was closest to my custom EQ, though I’d bumped up the highs just a little, reduced the lows and bumped up the mids a lot.  Actually, using the HearID test (which, for me, doesn’t do anything but boost the sibilant highs even more) and then adding that on top of the DEEP preset was actually close to my liking, but still too sparkly and thin.  I can see it would work if you have hearing issues at particular frequencies. I’m just topped out at 14kHz and above and fine with all the others.For my ears, my custom EQ now produces a crisp, clear full sound with punchy bass.  It’s a joy to listen to music with these.  Vocals are still a little thinner than I’d like, but I’ve found my ears can adapt to the sound profiles of buds over several hours and I get used them.  Some tracks are also ‘thin’ by design, like with many ABBA songs, so you have to choose songs accordingly when adjusting the EQ.  The 6.4 kHz slider is the one that really makes the highs sound harsh.Interestingly, my Soundcore Q30 over the ear headphones also have a similar bright and thin signature sound without any EQ adjustment.  Must be a Soundcore thing.Out of the box, I really like my SoundPEATS H1 as it has deep bass and great clarity.  The highs could be a little more forward, but I’m waiting on an app from SoundPEATS to address that with a custom EQ.  I now actually prefer the L3P, though still use my H1 for Heavy Metal, when I desire a dose of overly thumpy sub-woofer Kick Drum beat.  The L3P has good bass, but the H1 has more.  Volume-wise the L3P are loud enough for anyone, but perhaps not as loud as the H1.  I disable Absolute volume in Developer Options to get finer control over the volume.  Some songs sound better if the volume is reduced or increased by a click or two.LDAC support was added with the first firmware update.  To be honest, I don’t use it.  My ears can’t hear above 14kHZ anyway and I’ve tried some online tests to compare Hi Res tracks to others and like most people, I can’t distinguish the Hi Res files, other than by pure chance.  The L3P still sound great without.  There’s much hype relating to Hi Res and audio quality, as well as LDAC versus aptX.  Go Google it.  aptX is actually more beneficial to me for some strange reason.  Not using LDAC does mean though that I don’t suffer the debilitating battery consumption that others might, which is a plus.WARRANTY SUPPORT  1/10 - Caveat Emptor! :  (see Update above)My left earbud has a sound when in ANC/Transparency mode only, like an electrostatic clicking.  It occurs when I am walking, clicking in time with my steps, or if I touch the edges of the bud then I get multiple clicks.  I’ve seen others online have had the same issue.  I emailed Soundcore almost two weeks ago and since with no response.  I also sent a FEEDBACK message via the app – nada!  Soundcore on FB said just send us an email!  I’ve had Tribit and Taotronics issues and received new buds in less than a week total!  There will always be issues and if the company doesn’t support you, that is going to cost you.CONCLUSION :  Initially, I thought I’d be returning these as the sound and fit were intolerable out of the box.  However, working with them over many days and hours, I found they can be made to sound and fit great.Yes, there’s a lot of marketing hype associated with the L3P, but fundamentally, they are excellent value for money at $170.  You will not, as of right now, find a better value for features, app support and sound quality.  Warranty support is debatable as of right now for me, but Amazon will come to my rescue until Jan 31, 2022, if not Soundcore!Soundcore has indeed shaken up the $150-$300 market for earbuds with the Liberty 3 Pro.I hope this LONG review helps you with your purchase decisions.Check out my Earbud test tracks playlist on Amazon Music:https://music.amazon.com/user-playlists/6c1a03929ed947ab82cc33db24d7c001sune?ref=dm_sh_I4ZRJmh4tIHTtEUHGvvCYkvPi",True,Color: Midnight Black,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-q1p5ChEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610IQduCF5L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611KMvoLpBL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616MkmBQgHL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61i1t4U9pLL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pqhj9pBkL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wycTbnDSL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7131xHAtGVL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717Sp2h0cKL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71H7HqAzXPL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KuJTenZjL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71U8MISBblL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tf6HFc-cL._SY88.jpg']",6.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,6392.0,1910.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

Very comfortable initially but it gets annoying for me after around 2-3 hours.Mic is good, not great, noise cancellation is pretty good and I've gotten I'd say about 6 - 8 hours of use of the earbuds before I need to recharge.Overall very pleased with my purchase.

5.0,Hands down best buds at this pricepoint,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28WSM18SAL3AD?ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,32 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2022",2022-07-21,United States,,"First off, I'm not an audiophile but I do enjoy a pleasant, full and vibrant sound when listening to music. Most of the time, I'm listening to music through my klipsch computer speakers, definitive/denon home theater or harmon system in my car. For an upcoming trip, I was looking to pack light and leave the QC 35's behind so I started on a search to find a light, comfortable and good sounding TWS buds without breaking the bank.I first purchased a sub- $50 pair of well reviewed buds from a no-name brand. They were fine for the money, but have a very thick bassy and muddy sound profile and were not a good fit for my ear shape as after a few minutes of wearing, you could feel them slipping out - returned.Next up, I decided to try out the liberty air 2 pro's as they struck a good balance of price/performance. These were leaps and bounds better than the no-namers, with less bass, but a more balanced sound and some great features like ANC, transparency mode and a fantastic app from soundcore with great customization. I popped them in my ears and game over, this was the set. Unfortunately due to the thick body of the bud itself, they caused significant discomfort on my outer ear after 10 minutes and as much as I enjoyed the sound, they were unfortunately too uncomfortable to wear. So back to the drawing board.I was hesitant to purchase the liberty 3 for a few reasons. First off, the design made these look bulky, awkward and I didn't want something protruding out of my head. I was also worried about the fit, since they looked much wider than the air 2 pro's which were uncomfortable in the first place. And finally, I just couldn't imagine the 3's being worth the extra cost and the hype... Boy was I wrong.So here is my review. First of all, these sit much deeper in the ears than the air 2 pro's which create a better seal and noise isolation. Additionally the design and fit of these is superb. They sit up a bit higher and don't create pressure on the lower outer ear making them very comfortable for extended listening sessions. They are much easier to put in your ear's without fiddling too much to get a good, comfortable fit compared to the air 2 pro. Lastly, profile is good, they do not stick out or protrude out of your ears.I wont go into the app and customization, but if you know soundcore or watched any videos, you already know that it is superb and will be hard pressed to find better app support.And finally... the audio quality. Its hard to describe sound, as we all define it differently but I will do my best. First off, yes, these sound significantly better than the liberty 2 air with a wider soundstage, crisper highs and smoother bass. And for sound quality alone, they are absolutely worth the extra $$. The sound is not muddy, heavy or tinny but offers good separation and a great balance across the spectrum. I compared these side by side to my bose QC35's which are my daily drivers and I may actually enjoy the presence in these a bit more. The liberty 3's have more bass, crisper highs but offer a very different mid tone experience. The bose feel warmer and smoother, almost like the sound hugs your head whereas the liberty's feel wider and sharper. All in all, these sound incredible, fit very well and offer some great features at this price point. Could I spend a bit more and try the sony, sennheiser or bose? Sure, but there is no reason, as these are just a joy to listen to.The only con I can think of is the case. Its small and compact, certainly premium in feel but the way the buds fit into it is a bit awkward and finicky. I think the unique shape of these make it a bit more challenging to line up with the charging magnets.TLDR: Fantastic sound quality, easily a huge improvement over the liberty 2 series. Great comfort and fit and an incredible value for the money.",True,Color: Midnight Black,[],9.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,6392.0,1910.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

BUT...- the HearID and some presets increase the frequencies and distort. you can clearly hear the total SPL (sound pressure level) increases, which is bad EQ design. in general if you increase a few frequencies, you should decrease others, so the overall SPL is the same- the Soundcore software does not seem to do this (or it's not working), which causes distortion in the lower (<300 Hz) frequencies- you can still fix this! just use your own EQ, and if you increase some frequencies, decrease others! done and no more distortion- the default frequency response is actually pretty flat and quite lovely. very useful if you want to use for studio / monitoring / mixing. deep and meaningful bass response- noise cancellation is great- i didn't bother using the LDAC. the default codec is fine and i can't hear any artifacting. i would be surprised if a normal human could blind A/B between the default codec and LDAC- very detailed and revealing.- some people have commented the soundstage isn't super wide. this is all ear-buds my darling (unless some software sound processing is added). they are literally right in your ear canal. the sound stage is reduced because of the way the ears process proximity information (there is none... therefore, minimum sound-stage).- you will have to be careful when mixing because the natural tendency is to add MORE reverb, which won't translate well to other speakers... you must use speaker / room emulation with these buds- the HearID... well, i have slightly reduced hearing in my left ear, which i know about. and i can see it when i run the HearID test. however, when i listen using the HearID profile, 2 things happen: 1) the bass distortion above (which is BAD), and 2) the ghost image (centre image) pulls left. therefore the EQ is not accurately compensating for me missing a few minor frequencies, and is instead amplifying too many frequencies, so it's not compensating accurately and useless. if, instead, you had hearing that simply cut off at e.g. 16Hz, they would work fine. i don't, i just have a few missing frequencies.- this is regarding HearID in general, not necessarily Anker... i question the reasoning of amplifying the low bass frequencies EVER, even if you are hard of hearing. bass frequencies are where all the energy are. they can easily cause damage, especially when you have little amplifiers and speakers sitting right in your ear. if someone tests as being hard of hearing <60 Hz, that doesn't mean you should just turn up the volume! what's a great way for them to get even more hard of hearing? doing this! people if you're hard of hearing in the bass range, find a sensible balance, don't do yourself a harm <3.- lastly, to the distortion issues... what's the other terrible thing you can do to ear drums? try and hold them in a static ""in"" or ""out"" position. this is what clipping distortion does, which is the kind of distortion introduced by raising all of the EQ spectrum without reducing overall volume. it's not good. be aware.i would suggest, do a manual EQ curve, and you will love these. use the 3D mode if the soundstage is too low.

1.0,Update: From Hero to Zero,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OOIT1T5BTMXV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,32 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021",2021-10-29,United States,,"Alright, I feel like a tech reviewer right now so I’m going to give a detailed review on these. I never go in such detail but I have to for this one as they have been extremely hyped by many and I was looking forward to these true wireless earphones.First of all, I have been using these with my iPhone 13 Pro. This is very important to mention, because the LDAC feature on these headphones will NOT work with the iPhones.First impressions, I was blown away with the sound quality. I had used AirPods Pro, Beats Studio Buds and Galaxy Buds Pro, none of them comes close to the sound quality of these Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro. This is also due to the very well built app by Soundcore. The app is feature packed and you can customize almost everything to suit your needs. In short, these are the best sounding wireless earbuds I’ve ever used. The 3D Surround Sound mode actually works really good too, but it doesn’t feature spatial audio with head tracking.So how is the active noise canceling? If you go on Youtube you will hear that its one of the best. My experience has been a little interesting. These earbuds feature heardID and ANC test in the app which then customizes the sound and ANC according to your ears. While these are great features, I felt that ANC is actually weaker with or without  these features compared to I AirPods Pro. However, the ANC is definitely good on these buds if not excellent.Coming to transparency mode. Well, it’s average. In my opinion and experience, the AirPods Pro has the best transparency mode I’ve used. I’m not saying that the transparency mode is bad, it’s definitely useable but not as great as the AirPods Pro.Now the issues…I think the first one is kind of obvious, these are big earbuds and might not be for everyone.Another thing I noticed is that the case doesn’t feel very premium and I always find myself setting up the buds properly to charge them.My biggest gripe with these buds however is the dual connection. It feels like its not very optimized. Whenever I’m connected to my iPhone and iPad or Mac or Apple TV, the sound sometimes start crackling and goes on and off which gets annoying. The process is also slow when connecting to a new device. I am not sure if this happens on Android as I only used these buds on my Apple devices only. I do think they can fix this with a firmware update.So why get these buds over the others? The buds are definitely not perfect as they do have some issues that need fixing. However, the sound quality is amazing, ANC is good and the app is just amazing. When you consider the price of these buds compared to others, its a no brainer that these are the ones to get.Overall, 4 out 5 stars!UPDATE: Taking off 1 star. The dual connection has really gotten more annoying. The sounds goes on and off like every 2-3 minutes. There have been a lot of updates, but that issue hasn’t been fixed. However, the most recent issue I’ve found is that the noise canceling automatically turns off while I’m wearing these buds and when that happens the app constantly says that it can’t find the buds although they are connected to the phone. I would also like to add that these would work far better with Android than iOS devices. As of now, I am considering to get the Beats Fit Pro as well and check if they work better for my use cases.Final update: Taking off another star. After ordering the Beats Fit Pro and comparing both, the Beats simply works better for both iOS and Android. The issues I have mentioned before on the Soundcore still exist and the most annoying thing is the voice dropouts while watching content. I haven’t had a single dropout on the Beats. The beats also fit so well and the case is far better with strong magnets. I will say the sound quality is better on the Soundcore, when it works. Also the Soundcore has wireless charging. But the issues are far too annoying for me to keep using them. In short, I regret buying the Soundcore.",True,Color: Midnight Black,[],1.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,554.0,368.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

My biggest peeve is that there is no way to turn these off, other than putting them in the case. When they are sitting on a table they're constantly stealing the audio from my phone call and from My fire TV and anything else that is Bluetooth.I'm actually lowering my rating to one star because Eufy obviously does not read reviews of its products and update the firmware to better satisfy people who have already given them money. I just got done checking for an update and there is none. Without an off switch, I want to just throw these away because they're just such a pain in the ass.I'm a guy and I don't carry a purse and I'm not going to walk around with a case all the time. Even when I do put them in the case, they don't turn off and then I can never answer my calls because they are switching to Bluetooth to somewhere in the house where my earbuds are. Even the auto-off doesn't work as long as there is any active Bluetooth device in your house, they will just hook on to that Bluetooth and stay active and not disconnect from what you are using the earbuds for.Why can't I adjust it to the time that I would like for them to disconnect? I have communicated with them about this issue and there has been no firmware update to give you the simple ability to turn them off when you want to turn them off or control the length of time that will trigger auto-off. 30 minutes is ridiculous. I've prefer 10, but Eufy thinks that they know better than you. It's annoying and it wastes battery life. Charging speed is not impressive. I also hate the capacitive buttons as opposed to physical buttons. Every time I lean over, my hair brushes the earbud and it turns it off. Extremely annoying. Even when you do use the buttons, the left button just beeps and boops instead of using words to tell you what it's doing. My other $30 earbuds just tell you, and says things like ""pass through"" , ""noise reduction"". Why can't they do a simple update and let the earbuds announce their function. I don't understand beep and boop. They seem to be deaf to customer suggestions for opportunity for improvement.Lastly, these things will not stay in my ear. I've used every combination of earbuds size and wings. I am an ear surgeon, so don't talk to me about not understanding proper fit and anatomy. This wing design that only uses the antitragus sand ignores the concha cymba just does not work. It turns to rotate out with movement. A simple fiber to hold it under the scapha like a heating stuff would have helped so much, but I guess it is better to look cool than work well. I bought these to use while active and doing chores, and they are constantly going to ground.Noise reduction is fairly good but not great. What bugs me is that it will be doing fine and then all of a sudden it will change the background sound reduction for no reason at all. It can happen sitting in a chair and turning my head with no change in my environment.For $40, I would have been very pleased with these devices but at $120 they get two stars.  My Jabras are much better when I use the compression foam tips. I can also turn them off at will and they announce their setting.",True,Color: Fog Gray,[],2.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,554.0,368.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3
1.0,Died after 9 months.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31WYY04I664QS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2022",2022-08-04,United States,,"See original review at end.UPDATE #2:After talking with support, mine are definitely defective. Unfortunately, since I bought from Amazon warehouse, the warranty was only for 3 months. I've owned them for 9 months.Factor such things into your buying decisions. I recommend buying a different brand with a better warranty.UPDATE #1:These died on me.  Not sure why.  I'm working with support to get a replacement, if I'm within the warranty period.One ear bud has a high pitched sound, but nothing from the Bluetooth source.Plus, the seating problem in the charger has become problematic.  I had to fiddle with them every time I put them back into the case to make sure they charged.  Several more times, I've ended up with a dead ear bud when pulling out of the case.I've also struggled to get them to stay in my ear. If I'm walking around the house, one will usually pop out. I've tried the different sizes, but I couldn't find the magic combination. I definitely don't recommend them for running or any other activity.I would recommend going with another brand or product.  These are definitely not a premier product.ORIGINAL REVIEW:These are good earbuds, but there are some issues.  I use these for about 3-5 hours a day, mostly for meetings.The Good:* When including the charging case, good battery life* Excellent sound.  If you want your music to come alive, these will fill that need.* AFAICT, the microphone is very good on these and people can hear me clearly.* Good software for changing earbud settings.The Bad:* Poor connection in charging case.  About 90% of the time I have to wiggle one of the earbuds in the charging case to get it to charge.  Several times I've gone to pull out my earbuds only to find one didn't charge and is dead.* These don't stay in my ears.  I've tried every combination of wing and tip and they simply loosen over time.  Forget about exercise with these.  Once they are sweaty, they won't stay in.* Bluetooth issues are problematic.  Sometimes connects to my Windows 10 PC only for music, which means my microphone won't work.  This could be a Windows issue.  Also, when connected to 2 devices, and the second device becomes active, like when receiving a call, it will take over the connection and even  after the call is complete, the original connection won't be restored.  Again, this could be a Windows issue.* The battery in the earbuds when using noise cancellation is probably around 3 hours.  This is a much lower number than I expected.  Regardless, this still works for me as I don't need to use them for that long as once.  Also, they charge VERY fast when put back in the charging case.* I'm always touching the outside of the earbuds and this usually triggers a mute or volume increase, etc, by mistake.

This was to replace the apple AirPods pro which died a couple of weeks ago.SoundStage:Compared to Airpods, the soundstage of liberty 3 is way better. The overall sound reproduction was way better than Airpods Pro. The bass was thumpy and the mids and highs were clear, and the sound stage was open. The hearid sound profile best fits my listening style. Kudos to Anker - for providing value features at a very reasonable price point.Noise Cancellation: The noise cancellation is competent and is not at the level of Airpods pro or oneplus bud pro. They would suffice for regular office meetings or gym sessions. I don't think this is an earbud that I will rely on during a long flight.Transparency Mode: This is not a strong point of Liberty Pros 3. I don't really use this and plainly don't care for this feature on any headphones or earbuds.Problem: The liberty 3's was working great for a month. I used it for at most 3hours a day and switched between my oneplus buds pro and bose QC's.

These have excellent sound quality, noise cancelling, and I can be heard when using them for a phone call. The new pair doesn't stay in my ears nearly as well, needing an occasional push back in. This action leads to the 1st major design flaw. The touch controls activate, every time you touch them. So every time I push it back into my ear, The controls do something to my sound. I programmed a single tap for volume up or down, on left and right. Usually it's a volume change, so I just push on the other one to reseat it in my ear, if it needs it or not, just to get the volume back where I had it. The next major issue I have is with the same touch sensor design flaw. Whenever I exercise in high temps and sweat a lot, or if it rains, the controls will randomly start clicking away at the water and sweat dripping on the touch sensor.  I nearly threw them into the river I road beside today in frustration, then remembered they cost over $100.00 and stowed them into my pocket instead.

Who thought that touch controls was a good idea to put on the side of your head? What if you wear a hat? Or have long hair? I'll tell you what, It means the touch controls will randomly activate and make the most annoying sound ever for no reason. I literally have no idea where I'm touching these to actually make the touch controls work and it makes this annoying bonking noise every time you activate it that is somehow loud enough to be physically painful.Plus anytime you adjust your headphones you're going to accidentally pause your music or spam volume up and blast your eardrums out. Yes you can turn touch controls off but you literally have no physical way to stop your music if you're only using one earbud, without unbearing your phone from your pocket or going to get it off of  wherever you put it away from your work area so it doesn't get smashed.The previous generation of headphones had one single button on each headphone that you could use to power on the headphone and to power off the headphone. In case you wanted to put it in your pocket and not have it randomly playing and pausing your music because you needed to take it out of your ear.The previous generation of headphones was also better sounding and had better battery life and and didn't have unusable touch controls or god-awful transparency mode that makes it sound like wet toilet paper anytime you take the headphones out of the case.In the sound department these sound they're okay. The previous versions had a lot More custom settings that I thought these would have because they're more expensive. I was expecting this pair of headphones to also have those settings, they don't.The only good thing I found so far is that they seem to be able to make the actual case for the headphone that lives in your pocket a lot smaller. And this time they didn't cover the whole damn thing in rubberized plastic. This time it's sleek and slippery plastic that slips right into your pocket and disappears and the case being a whole lot smaller in both dimensions also helps with that. The headphones themselves are also quite a bit smaller than the last generation.In summaryTouch controls are garbage and don't even work. If you turn them off you have no way to control your music at all without using your phone. The sound isn't as customizable as The last generation. The noise canceling is okay even though it causes a pressure difference in your eardrum that is basically the same as having in ear infection. And you better get used to The touch controls randomly pausing and starting in changing the volume of your music. Plus the headphones don't remember your settings and reset to default every time You take them out of the case.

The fit was one of the best that I've experienced due to the silicone ear tips (and I had tried 6 or 7 earbuds during that time). I was so happy with the fit and the fact that the sound was quite good that I didn't closely examine the other features before deciding to keep them. That was a huge mistake. The 2 features that make me regret my decision are: 1) The silicone tips became loose soon after the return period ended and the fit was no longer as secure as when they were newer. The ear tips always and dependably spin around. The little nub of raised plastic is woefully inadequate at keeping them in place. 2) These earbuds do not turn off automatically until 30 minutes after being disconnected from all devices AND not being worn. In those 30 minutes, the battery is drained quite a bit. Also, it is impossible to test if they have turned off because when you start touching them with your hands or put them in the ears, they turn on. So you have no idea if they were still on or only just turned on. In the few times where I've attempted to test if they do indeed turn off automatically, I could never quite get definite answers. Also, the fact that they have to be disconnected from ALL devices and be out of the ears makes it much more likely that they will not turn off until the batteries have been run dry because they can be connected to 2 devices at the same time. There are other minor details that make me dissatisfied with these earbuds. Sometimes after being in the case for a long time, one or both earbuds will be less than 100% charged. Also, the batteries do not last as long as I would like. I'm getting 5 hours max for music. Lastly, touch controls are a hassle compared to a physical button when it comes to earbuds. Just handling the earbuds to insert or remove them means you are changing the volume or something else. The touch controls in these particular earbuds are temperamental. They'll register a touch when you didn't tap the earbud. This I've found happens more often when I'm lying down or moving a lot. They also don't register touches when I'm actually tapping on them.

Not much else to say on the matter. These block out less external noise, and have a bit of tin-canniness in the sound. 3/5.In terms of microphone quality, overall these are perfectly adequate. I haven't used the mic very much, but I'm told that the sound quality is good enough for people to understand me, and haven't heard any complaints. 3/5.In terms of comfort, I also think these SL3Ps are inferior to my AirPods, however take that with a grain of salt, because you would most likely get used to how these SL3Ps fit in your ear after some time using them (I went through a similar period with my AirPods and my other headphones). They do have the benefit of being designed to sort of ""lock"" into your ear, however, which means they are less likely to fall out during intensive activity. 4/5.Now, the reason I give this product 2 stars overall is because it is defective in 2 ways.The first is that the buds wont always ""connect"" when you put them in the case. This means they wont be charging, and will likely be out of charge when you next take them out. In other words, they had the same issue my AirPods developed over time from day 1. Not good. However, to be fair, this is slightly less of an issue than when my AirPods developed this, as these SL3Ps have a case that has indicator lights beneath each bud which come on when the respective bud is detected in the case. So, theoretically, as long as you look for the light every time you put them away, you can ensure they always connect.The second is that, regardless of if the buds were connected to the case (as indicated by the light in the case), I've found the right ear bud has about a 20-35% chance of simply not working when you remove it from the case.

They sound amazing. There's some amazing sound engineering that went into this.Unfortunately, that's where the good part stops.I've had these earbuds since March when they came out and they just recently died on me. Yep, dead. I live in Florida where we have things called thunderstorms and after a particularly harsh one, my earbuds died. So outta luck on the warranty front, I'm pretty sure. But I'm not going to fight a warranty department on this.The things that kill these earbuds aren't the thunderstorm nor the sound, but the case, charging, battery life, the touch sensitivity and price.In the year that I had these, I'd say about 40% of the time when I put the earbuds into the really cool-looking and closing case, the earbud was misaligned and didn't charge. It got to the point where when I put it in, I could almost count on it not charging. So when it did charge, I was pleasantly surprised.The wireless charging feature on these worked extremely well. At the very least, I always had a charged case, which isn't nothing.Also, the touch sensitivity on my earbuds often had phantom touches. Occasionally, out of nowhere, the music would pause and I'd hear the tone that accompanies when I would touch it to pause. Did I actually touch the earbud? No. Also, forget about being in any position other than bolt upright. If these earbuds came in contact with another surface (hair, couch back, strong wind gust), it would register another touch.Finally, the bluetooth on this was often wonky. I can't tell if that was the fault of Soundcore or Google (I'm a Pixel 6 Pro user), but I would often get weird sound separation issues. I never knew where to point the finger, only that I've got three sets of earbuds, and this is the only one which has these issues.Finally, these have been on sale for $90 at one point, which is a much better deal than the $170 Soundcore usually charges. In March, it seemed pricey, but maybe worth it? In retrospect, not so much. Since these headphones bit the dust, I might spend $80 on them...but I'd debate even then. At $80, I can think of half a dozen earbuds that are not as stellar in sound, but ""good enough"" on sound, and worlds better in durability.If you're looking for a good set of earbuds, I strongly recommend the Liberty Pro 2 upgraded versions.

I was deciding between these and the Status Audio Between Pro. I wish I would have gone the other direction.First, don't believe the hype from youtube. All of the reviewers acknowledge that they were given a pair to review and other pairs to give away. I didn't find a single critical review that addressed the issues I've experienced. I can't be the only one...I am deep into the Apple ecosystem. Apple computers, iPhone, air pods, apple watch, the whole kit. I've always been disappointed with the sound of my Airpod pros but loved the transparency mode and noise cancellation. The airpods are superior with regards to both of these modes. Without question, they outperform the soundcore. Even after spending time finding the right fit and doing the HearID ANC test (repeatedly to try to obtain a result that worked well) ANC is barely noticeable and the transparency mode kind of works. The Airpods are super customizable and you can do a lot of cool things with regards to EQ and volume for the transparency mode.For music, the sound quality of the Liberty 3 Pro is superior to the Airpods. After doing the Hear ID Sound Test it generated a fairly accurate, although significantly hyped response to my hearing test. Each ear was drastically different and when the eq was engaged the tone was unlistenable, disorienting and annoying. I did my own eq based loosely off the frequencies that were boosted/cut and tailored to my preferences. This made them shine. I am an audio engineer so I knew what I was looking for - can the average listener achieve the same results?My single largest complaint is that the bluetooth connectivity is absolutely unreliable. After pairing them with my iPhone (12 pro max) and listening for a bit sometimes the ANC or transparency modes will disengage. They FREQUENTLY lose connection to the phone while listening to spotify despite showing still connected in the bluetooth menu and in spotify. I have to restart bluetooth, put the earbuds back into their case, put them back into my ears and pray that they connect again. It's a crapshoot whether they will connect.I regret this purchase. They were not worth the money. I should have gone with the Status Audio earbuds. The microphone is barely improved over the Airpods with more low frequency content but also more road noise while driving and wind noise.I am an Anker fanboy.

For reference I have an iPhone 14.The problem is the auto connect is SUPER annoying and half the time I can't get them to connect to what I actually want them to. Let me explain.You have to use an app to run these properly and operate the noise cancellation. That is fine, but I have to connect to the app, then disconnect it from the phone, then connect it to my PC.  It's SOOOO annoying. There is an option to pick which device you want it to run through once you get both connected to the app, but again, it's a whole process and when I just want to connect and go it's so much trouble. It will not let me simply connect to my PC or laptop, it forces you to run it all through the app, then mess with it to connect to anything other than where ever the app is located.Now, a year later I can't get them to connect at all. It was already taking multiple times hitting connect even to hook it into the phone. It would say ""Connection Unsuccessful"" multiple times before it finally connected. Often I had to ""forget device"" and then reconnect it completely. NOW it won't connect to the app or anything else. Multiple tries and going through the app does nothing.

4.0,Better than cheap earbuds but many problems a cheaper one wouldn't have,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KD7YWRN88JGB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,12 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2023",2023-09-02,United States,,"I got tired of my cheaper earbuds constantly having issues like failing to connect to the charger pins or staying on in the case causing my Bluetooth connection to constantly try to route to the earbuds across the house. So I splashed out on these. They solved my main problems I had before but added their own, subtler problems.The case for these are well made and I haven't had too much problem getting them to connect, they have a slope factor that causes the earbuds to fall into place. However they still use stupid tiny pins to connect the earbuds to the case which means sometimes you have to lift and drop to get them to line up just right. There's lights in the case that pulse when they're connected and charging which is very helpful. The weirdest thing about the case is that there's a switch in the lid and if you leave it open the earbuds is still on and not charging. But it's fairly easy to get muscle memory to always close it right away and it prevents the earbuds in the case from turnimg back on unexpectedly.The low battery warning on these earbuds is a lot less problematic than others. It doesn't give incessant low battery warnings every minute like others and it's not jarringly loud or unpleasant. It gives a warning around 10 percent and then right before shutting off. It'll still wake you up if you fall asleep with them in and there's no option to turn them off but it's a step up from earbuds where you half the battery life is unusable due to nearly siren like alerts.The earbuds have this convoluted mechanic to try preventing them from falling out that straight up doesn't work unless you have the exact right ear shape. The second rubber ear piece is meant to jam into the fold of your ear rotates around the earbuds and the earbuds over time rotates itself back. So you end up needing to rerotate the thing every half hour in my experience. If you absolutely need these to stay in then get one with a proper clip.The noise canceling is surprisingly decent. I bought it despite having that feature (I don't want a mic in my earbuds) but I do find it a passable replacement for real ear protection for brief or light noise. I wouldn't chainsaw or run heavy machinery with them in but it works for vacuuming. The ""pass through"" mode doesn't really work well enough to have a conversation but it helps avoid some of that ""internal pressure"" you get with dual earbuds where you're listening to the noise of your own head.Unfortunately there's no way to change it so that noise canceling and pass through are disabled when you are using a single earbud. I'll occasionally discover my earbud's battery life is horrible because ANC got accidentally turned on and there's no clear way to tell without opening the cumbersome app. You can configure the TouchPad to enable/disable ANC but that makes it easier for it to be accidentally enabled too.The TouchPad on the earbuds sucks. You will constantly be changing some mode whenever you stretch and accidentally graze the earbuds with your arm. Or whenever you are trying to rerotate it or adjust it you'll suddenly find you paused what you're listening to. A real button would be such a better experience.Reception range is better than average but not impressively so. Battery life is mediocre but workable if you alternate earbud's. Earbuds charge quick enough to manage if you find yourself low in both as long as you don't forget to recharge the case every day or two. If the case gets low I've found that the case needs to be recharged fully before it'll recharge earbud's.App sucks for day to day use but had a couple neat options for when you first get the earbuds.The mode for connecting to multiple devices is utterly broken, you end up with unusable earbuds because they only play from one device and it's usually the wrong one. There's lots of issues around BT protocol version and it requiring all three devices being on the exact right ones... It's a mess. Google it and you'll find countless issues.The earbuds have a bug where occasionally they'll refuse to reconnect to the device you always use them with. There's no way around that besides turning the earbuds fully off which there's no method to do besides forcibly draining the batteries over the course of a full day. There's no way of knowing when it'll happen so make sure you always have backup headphones ready to go.",True,Color: Midnight Black,[],1.0,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,1727.0,612.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 99.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

The Negative, which is a deciding factor for me, the battery life is not very great.

4.0,Terrible quality control BUT BEST SOUND EVER when you get a working pair!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L1J9SO6LEPWG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023",2023-11-25,United States,,"Would be nice if I could get a pair that worked.  The Liberty 3 just arrived and only the left ear bud charges/lights up in the case.  So no Bluetooth signal is found and I couldn’t use them.The Liberty 4 I ordered had terrible distortion in the left ear only.  I reordered and the new pair was fine.I have had earbuds by Technics, Sony and JBL and all were in perfect working condition with no defects. Why isn’t Anker overseeing the manufacturing of these?  They clearly need to change to someone else as the failure rate has to be high if I got 2 out of 2 that were bad.UPDATE:  I have to add the positives.  After having used the Technics AZ80 ($300, they sound dead but fit is good), JBL Tune 230nc (I also like), JBL Live pro tws2 (like), Sony 1000xm5 (horrible sound and very limited app), Ear Fun Air Pro3 (ok but the on-bud controls aren’t very sure and they make a lot of mistakes), OnePlus Buds Pro 2 (no on-bud volume control!), and the Soundcore Liberty 4, I keep coming back to these for sound AND fit.  They have all different combinations of fittings so you get it just right.  When correctly fitted, these aren’t merely shoved into your ears, they are kind of “anchored” in so they have a tight seal and they don’t loosen or fall out.  Read the fitting directions and try different combos of wings and in-ear cups.  Then use a mirror to find the ridge in your ear to turn the buds so the wing goes under it - this is what anchors them in.  As far as sound, Soundcores just have that something extra - like my old 70’s Marantz receiver did/does (I still have it).  A sparkle that is unique.  I like good bass but also it has to sparkle on the high end and once you adjust the equalizer, you have that in spades!  The other pluses that most don’t have are the unlimited custom EQ settings you can make and save separately.  Technics only allows one custom EQ and you get zero sparkle even with the high end all the way up.  They sound dead.  The noise cancellation is the best of the brands I have used.  I have a space heater running in my bedroom and when these buds kick in with no music playing, it’s complete and total silence.  I thought the heater had gone off! So if you need to sleep in silence on a plane, these are your pick.  You can still hear people talking some which how all of them seem to be designed.  It’s supposed to cancel noise, not voices.  They are fully customizable for touch controls and the touch is very sure, I don’t make mistakes when touching them.  The app has everything you could want - however I wish it gave the percent charged for each bud, it just has a battery symbol to see charge.  Now I do also have the Liberty 4’s and I would say they sound equally good, but since they don’t have the ear wings, they don’t stay in as well. But I do kind of like the stem squeeze controls.  Still, best sound ever like these, although someone said they don’t think the 4’s sound as good as the 3’s.  That has not been my experience.  Damn.  You should hear what One Bourbon, One Scotch One Beer by George Thorogood sounds like playing on these while I’m writing this!  See the EQ curve I am using  in the picture.

The tech support was awesome (as the apps always have trouble with my specific phone model) and the issue resolved within one day... yes one day. I was surprised by this myself. They are mid range price and are in that category for a reason. They are definitely at the top in that mid-range category, for me anyway. Let me explain. They produce very loud and mostly crisp music. I listen to all sorts of music but when Im in the gym I like em loud. I usually listen to Rap/ EDM and music that has alot of bass. Now the Linkbuds S I also got and even though the music is clearer and crisper it doesnt have the same umph. To compensate for the low bass you end up turning the gain up on the EQ and it further lowers the total loudness overall. So for me their is only a slight sacrifice of quality for a whole lot of extra quantity.The noise cancellation on these are mediocre at best. In the gym I can hear ALOT of whats going on around me and that was AFTER upgrading the stock silicone ear tips to comply premium sound dampening foam ones.So if your looking for loud and pretty darn clear youve found your earbuds probably. The microphone picks up alot of ambient noise as well and makes it difficult for the other person to hear you on a call which needs to be factored in. If your not using it for phone calls and/or in a noisy environment Id highly recommend these.  I have to be honest though after trying the wf1000xm4's I cant go backwards. After hearing the best of all worlds unfortunately Im returning these and purchasing another pair on those. But if you cant afford that price range then these are a steal.

4.0,DYNAMITE for music - not so much for phone calls,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MU0FWSDZ3FBS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,37 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2023",2023-04-26,United States,,"First, let me say I have owned my share of high-end headphones over the years. I currently own a set of Sony's WH1000x-MH3s (I think they are the 3's), which are AMAZING, but I have also had Beats (buds - wired and Bluetooth), a set of wired of the legendary Sony MDR-V6 digitals (which I refuse to part with they are so good, even if I did get them in 1987 and the wires are ""sticky""). But they are cans, and sometimes I want something a bit lighter and more compact.SOUND: The Anker buds have amazing sound - full stop. The lows are solid and the highs are very crisp. The app will let you customize them nearly any way you can think of to get just the sound profile you want. Imaging is good, but not mind-blowingly good. The are comfortable to wear, and you can customize the ""buttons"" for all kinds of functions, depending on what you like.PHONE USE: The sound is good, but does not rival my Poly 5200 headset in mic quality, or functionality. I was really hoping these earbuds would take the place of both for me, but I cannot find a way to mute a call in progress without using the phone's keyboard. This is a big miss if you want this for phone / conference calls. I mean, having to have the handset right there when you are on a call, sort of defeats the purpose of wireless headsets. The Poly has a dedicated button for this, and I cannot find a way to program the Anker to do this. Maybe I have missed it somewhere, but I would suggest that Anker add a ""phone profile"" in the software, to allow this. I really wanted to just have these be my only headset, but that doesn't look like it will work for me. This may be just me.... and the sound is completely passable and they may be fine for you. If they were to fix this, I would upgrade my review to 5 stars. If you aren't going to use these for phone use, buy them. Like now.BATTERY: I haven't used these for extended periods yet, but I have yet to charge the base - in about a week. So, I think the battery life is just fine.FIT / FUNCTION: If you can't find a combination of the silicone adapters to make these buds fit your ears well, I'd be pretty surprised - they come with a *pile* of them. as far as function goes, the only gripe I have is it can be a bit challenging to get the bud out of the case. Putting them in is great as they have a magnet that snaps them into place. Now, this also means that they won't fall out inadvertently, which is a good thing. I find myself grabbing the silicone, which is concerning as eventually these will wear and fail, I fear. It might be useful for Anker to make a slightly larger mark on them to tell which is right / left. There is a mark, but it's tiny. I'm sure over time, it will become second nature.ANC: The only ANC headphones I have and can compare to are the Sony's 1000's, which isn't a fair comparison, as they are full cans. They were also like $275 when I bought them, vs <$100 for the Anker's. The Anker's ANC probably drowns out 75% of the background noise, if you have any music playing. Example: I am listening to music right now while typing this on a full mechanical keyboard. Between tracks I can hear my typing, but not when music is playing.  If you don't have music playing, it's maybe 50% noise cancelling. So, these aren't going to beat something like a full set of cans, but overall, I am happy with it. I'll be taking them on vacation next week, and that will be the real test of the ANC.VALUE: Simply put, these are just insanely good headphones for the money. I got them on sale, thinking, ""well, I'll try them, if they don't perform, I'll return them."". I am definitely not returning them. Even at regular price these are an excellent value, and I'd buy them again.OVERALL: Great sound quality, good ANC, and a tremendous value for money.

4.0,Excellent sound. Excellent app. So-so case ergonomics.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R44DT8IMPES02/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2022",2022-05-08,United States,,"-  have had these things for a little over a month now. I wanted a nice sounding pair of buds, because I work as a welder, so I can't wear over the ear style because of my hood.. I wanted a seal type to double as light duty ear plugs, but also have the transparency mode for conversion with engineers when they come down. I'm the kind of person who pays meticulous attention to things I use, so if you're reading this, Ill do my best to be fair and descriptive.Case: simply put; don't like it. The texture is very smooth and I constantly worry I'm gonna drop it.. And because of the slide style it uses to open, I have yet to find a decent cover case. Putting the ear buds back in is kind of frustrating too.. They might snap into their area, but pay attention closely, because often they don't get good contact to charge... This had happened to me several times.. Even after I made sure they were in with contact, apparently from bouncing around in my bag, they lost contact somehow... To have a fully charged right and dead left is annoying AF... Like the way it looks and the style points, but as a whole, could be way better...Fitting: there are so many options.. I spent weeks trying on size 1, wing 3, size 2 wing 2, and even mix matched sides to try and find the 'best fit': in fact I just am trying a new combo today.. So you'll have plenty of time to try and figure out your goldilocks combination.. It was kind of annoying, because you can't make a choice on the tip/wing based on 20 minutes of wearing them, especially if you intend to wear them for hours at a time. However, I respect soundcore for all these options, and for that I give them the thumbs up as opposed to just giving 3 ear tips; they want you to find that comfy fit, and the effort does not go unnoticed.Sound: at first they sounded a little low on bass for my tastes, but between finding the right tip and using the app, I have found an excellent sound profile that I truly enjoy. I listen to songs I've heard thousands of times, and still occasionally go ""wait.. Never heard THAT tiny detail before."" in short, put in the time to get a good fit, run their soundcore sound profile test, and bam, you got some kicka## buds for the price point. You won't get good sound without a good seal, and I was surprised to realize that the size I thought I would use, wasn't the size I 'should' use. Also, when removing the buds, do a twisting pull out method. Pulling straight out will end in the silicone tips being flipped out.App: the app alone is partly why I wanted to hold onto these as opposed to returning them. Great app. It's been getting updates, so it's great to know they didn't just toss out some half baked app and forget about it.. It's truly great. Use it to fully optimize your listening experience, and you will be rewarded handsomely.Connection: yes, occasionally there's a hiccup in the connection, but I've had that happen with my 50 dollar buds too, so I don't think it's these buds specifically. Plus, the app just updated the firmware and specifically said 'fixed connection issues'. So once again, nice to see continued support from soundcore.Overall: great headphones for the price.

A few days beforehand I had bought the sound core sports X10 buds. Now those are really good buds in their own right. But I return them to Amazon to get these. Since I bought the X 10 sport for pretty much the same price that these Liberty 3 Pros were on sale for during Prime. This is my second pair of Liberty Pros. I had the Liberty 2 Pros a couple years back they were great buds but like the Liberty tattoos, the Liberty threes, don't completely fit my ears properly. I use these for the gym and when I sweat a lot the ear tips and wings end up sliding somewhat in my ears. But having said that that's my only complaint about these buds. For the price they cannot be beat at all. I would even dare to say they are better than the Sony xm4 earbuds. And I say that because due to the update that Sony had come a lot of the right earbuds are not holding charges longer than 10 minutes. And for the price they charge for them, you might as well just get these and save some money and buy something else. Especially since the sound quality of these buds match the Sony's. I would even say these match and maybe in some ways surpass the Sennheiser momentum threes. They have great of sound quality. They're not as good as Sony or Bose in the noise canceling but they rival the Sennheiser momentums in noise canceling. These are in my rotation to use for everyday listening or the gym. And I only have them behind the Technica A60 and Sony Link buds. As in my opinion the a60s have better sound but maybe not as loud as the Liberty threes and the Sony links noise canceling is better. As long as Soundcore continues to honor their warranties and give good customer service. I will always recommend these. I would just to Soundcore, to work on those wing tips and ear tips for the buds.

2.0,A underwhelming experience,,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on December 7, 2022",2022-12-07,Canada,,"After years of hearing about Jabra earbuds, I was excited to hear the hype for myself.The Elite 7 Pros' left me rather disappointed. The case itself is bulky and looks dated. The earbuds themselves, while relatively compact — unfortunately for me, they felt very uncomfortable and terrible after 20 minutes of normal usage. There are also no air-vents to help alleviate the pressure sensation, which I found surprising for ANC earbuds.The sound profile is average at best, and certainly nothing to rave about (again for the brand name and the MRSP asking amount of such premium earbuds). The bass is while decent, highs / trebles often sounded harsh and even over-processed at times. ANC technically works but only to a minimum degree, therefore making it subpar in quality. I was rather surprised as the Elite 7 Pros' are Jabra's most recent flagship earbuds. The transparency / ""hear through"" mode doesn't work well and isn't really noticeable when on or off. Phone call quality sounded terrible and was the ultimate deal breaker for me...as if you're speaking to someone underwater (it has a horrible odd distortion / high-pitch artificial sound). The app works as advertised, but is also buggy and has it's own set of issues (random odd connectivity dropouts).Everything with these flagship earbuds left me wanting so much more (especially at full MRSP). I was really underwhelmed and disappointed, ending up returning these earbuds the very next day (even though I got these on sale with $100 off).Honestly, I would look elsewhere and can not recommend getting the Jabra Elite 7 Pros' at full asking price. There are definitely better, more modern earbud options these days — at the same price or even at the sub $200 price range.

2.0,"Neutral Sound, Great Transparency Mode, Solid App ... Lousy Call Quality",,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on January 18, 2023",2023-01-18,Canada,,"Likes* After trying a half a dozen earbuds and headphones to test their transparency mode, there was only one non-Apple set that approached the Airpod Pro 2 earbuds they were replacing in quality, and that was the Jabra Elite 7 Pros. I could have a normal conversation with them in. Most products sound like you're talking in a bathtub, and some were truly atrocious (Surface 2 Headphones ... wow, bad).* Unlike many earbuds, the sound profile is neutral, so you don't get the boomy bass and rolled off treble that's typical of most earbuds. If you're a fan of jazz, classical, acoustic music, or any other genre that can benefit from neutrality, you owe it to yourself to try these. The resolution is quite good, too, as is the sound staging.* The app is truly a one stop shop to administer the earbuds, and the ability to tailor their response to your actual hearing (yes, that's an option) may be a bit frightening if you're like me and discover you have significant hearing loss in one ear, it can only help get you a more balanced response from the earbuds.Dislikes* When assigning options to the button on each earbud, volume is not one of the options. This leaves you to use a digital assistant to raise or lower the volume, or the rocker on your phone. With my old Airpod Pro 2 earbuds, I could do the volume right from the earbuds themselves.* Update: I have had multiple callers tell me they can barely hear me on the other end, using terms like 'you sound like you're underwater' or 'you sound like you're talking through a mask'. The minute I switch to speaker, they can hear me fine. This is an issue noted by MANY owners of this set of earbuds, as well as other previous models (75t). Detective work on the Internet shows that this problem has been at least a couple of years since discovery, with no fix, and with prior models showing the same issues, it's clear there's no fix coming. I still LOVE the sound of these earbuds, and continue to use them for music consumption, but the minute I find another set of earbuds that approach this neutrality and still let me make a decent phone call, these are going into the garbage. The entire point of earbuds like this is that you have a full headset.

I downloaded the app, customized my preferences, installed the latest firmware. Look and feel is good, performance is not.On my phone - Audio quality is very good when listening to music, but there is a significant delay when watching any sort of accompanying video. Microphone quality is absolutely terrible, which is ironic given that the microphone is advertised as a selling point. ANC is only ok, hearthrough is very bad (it just amplifies even the lightest background noise - a quiet fan whirring becomes really loud).On my PC - Audio quality has mild background static regardless of what I'm doing. Microphone quality is similarly bad. I also hear a static pop anytime I change from audio only to something that accesses the microphone.Overall, really disappointed in my decision to try out this Jabra product and I'll be returning them immediately to try out another brand.

I have gotten complaints with every pair other than these and have been asked multiple times to recommend. Loud noises are barely heard by the other side while I can still hear their voice clearly over the sound of wind and cars. Noise reduction is  miles ahead the competition, likely due to the bone conduction tech.Fit is great and more comfortable than bigger and looser fitting 85t.

Perhaps Apple is better but I don't think the difference is noticeable overall.ANC is good. Maybe Sony is 15% better but are 50% less comfortable and have 2ay worse noise reduction during calls. I don't think this trade-off is worth it. ANC blocks subway noise completely. I don't think people should be expecting a tomb of silence with earbuds.Battery life is great and no complaints.

2.0,Shockingly bad user experience...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K0LCJ8WSEFOW?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,26 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2023",2023-11-15,United States,,"I've used many different brands of earbuds, and for the price, these are probably the worst I've used, to a degree I'm struggling to comprehend. Let's get one thing out of the way: they sound good. It's better than my AirPods Pro 2s. Everything else, and I mean everything else, is so much worse. Let's start at the top.These things are so slippery that I struggle to get them out of the case without dropping them. And for me, the shape is hard to get into my ears. Also, the case feels cheap. They charge $300 for these?Setup is a chore. You are required to use the app to access any of its features. And boy, is it a piece of work. From opening the app to first listening to anything took just over an hour. AN HOUR! You must log into a Sony account to get most of the high-end features to work, which is nonsense. And lord help you if you had a Playstation account 15 years ago. I appreciate the trouble Sony has gone to for security, but I had to do a 10-part captcha from hell twice to get into the account. And the translation to English in the app is poor at best, making the whole experience a head-scratching mess. The device pairing process is easy, however.The noise canceling is about as good as my 70-dollar no-name Chinese buds. Seems better at high-pitched things than general background noise, which is a strange feat as the former is much harder to pull off. I struggle to hear dogs barking, but my AC is as clear as a bell. The ambient pass-through is barely acceptable, not even in the same league as the AirPod Pros. Your voice tends to be over-amplified and slightly delayed, making talking to and understanding others a mess. The feature that mutes whatever you are listening to and turns off ANC when you start talking is hit or miss. It works about half the time when I start talking. The other half kicks on when any noise is picked up. Very annoying.Now, the reason I purchased these is Multipoint Bluetooth. This feature lets devices connect to multiple devices simultaneously and quickly switch between them. It's crucial for any work that has you bouncing between phone calls and working on a PC. Let me tell you, Sony's implementation is worse than useless. Can I connect to two devices? Sure. Can I stay connected to two devices? Absolutely not. When they are connected, does it switch seamlessly between the two? Also, absolutely not. If one is already making a sound, the other device can't be changed without silencing the first device. So, say you are listening to YouTube on your PC and get a call. To switch to the call, pause YouTube and anything else making sound, then answer the call. And about 50% of the time, it will switch. Otherwise, you have to change it manually. What is even the point? Even more fun is that the second device can't be switched to after some time, between 5 minutes and who knows how long, without manually going into settings and reconnecting first. Then you get another 5 minutes to a couple of hours of flaky ""fast switching"".The battery life is an actual lie. They claim 8 hours, but with all features turned off except playback, I got closer to 6. With ANC on, I may have gotten 4-5 hours. Each bud's battery seems to drain at different speeds as well. So, while one may have 10% left, the other is already dead.I would be less critical if these were $100 instead of $300. Crucially, though, even at $100, I would still return them. Other than sounding great, they are terrible to use. And for $100, I can get earbuds that sound just as good but aren't so finicky.In closing, I'm surprised Sony released such a poor product. They're so bad that it's tarnished my view of the company.",True,Color: Black,[],1.0,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,104.0,82.0,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 278, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5

I own the previous generation Sony 1000XM4 noise canceling ear buds, but unfortunately the right ear bud battery was dying after 2ish years of near constant use.Lucky me, or so I though, this new version released. I was excited they were smaller as I sleep with them to distract me from wife snoring, and my over thinking mind racing as I try to sleep.These ear buds suck.First, they're slick. Like, slippery when not wet. They're a pain to manipulate because the entire outer surface is a shiney black plastic. Going in the case, coming out the case, fitting the correctly to your ear. God forbid you drop one and have to grab it.Second, the previous generation has far better noise canceling. Putting those in was like tuning out the world. These XM5's won't tune out my wife's relatively low volume snoring on the best of nights. If I'm sleeping with one ear bud pointed away, or covered, from her side of the bed, the noise canceling does not work at all. Snoring comes through loud and clear, even over the noise I listen to to fall asleep. This was not an issue on the previous version. I had no issues sleeping on my side, or not pointing both ear buds in her direction to get adequate noise canceling. Obvious stuff gets through when it shouldn't.Third, and most annoying, the touch sensitivity on these things is insane. Not only will the briefest of brushes of the hand either pause what your listening to, or turn off noise cancelling, but so can your pillow case or any other fabric that brushes them. Sometimes activating multiple times in a single touch. Again, this was never an issue in the previous version. The only way to fix this is to turn the feature off entirely, making you wholely dependent on your phone to control playback or noise canceling functionality.I've been a big fan of Sony's noise cancelling for years now. I genuinely think it's the best in the business. But these headphones should be a hard pass for anyone looking to buy.Trust me when I say this: save yourself some money and buy the previous generation if you can find them.

These were the highest rated online. THEY WERE FAR FROM THE BEST! For starters, setup with iOS would have been easier if Sony had a better app. The app crashed a couple times during the setup process due to it trying to update the ear buds firmware. Once I got past that I was able to dive into the settings within the app for the ear buds. There were many settings and nothing out of the ordinary. The feature to connect 2 devices at once via Bluetooth was nice. However the noise cancellation feature itself was sub-par. Even after trying all of the different size buds that came with the product and performing the in app test to make sure I had the correct fit. Noise Cancellation while on a phone call was good for the caller on the other end. But the disappointment to me was when I had the ear buds in, not playing anything with noise cancellation on. It would muffle the outside noise but not cancel it. I was as if I simply had ear plugs in. For that reason I returned them. The body of the ear bud was also large and heavy which caused it to fall out of my ear when simply walking. I've had AirPod Pros, Beats Fit Pro's and these Sony WF-1000XM5.

THUD!!! Every footfall: THUD! THUD! THUD! There does not seem to be any venting in these earbuds to alleviate the pressure that causes this.Connectivity is also horrible, unless sitting perfectly still. I experienced constant drops and choppy sounding music at the gym. The left earbud especially would just drop and come back for no reason.  This happens even when set to ""Prioritize Stable Connection"". Granted, the gym is a busy place, with a lot of other people using blue-tooth earbuds. So there's interference. But other brands seem to have this resolved. I have been using a pair of Pixel Buds Pro for months and have absolutely no issues with interference or choppy sound - unless I go out of range from my phone.The tips constantly come off in my ear when I remove them. They also tend to come off in the case when pulling them out.The Headphones Connect app is a bit hard to navigate as well. I am sure with some time I could get used to it. And if you want 360 Reality Audio, you have to pay for it and use some 3rd party app. I also got an i-app popup offer (ad) to buy a different model of Sony buds - why???Tapping, long pressing, etc on the earbuds are not the same as other brands. I don't really feel like learning a new set of actions, when the last few sets of earbuds I have owned all share (essentially) the same tap/press functions (Samsung and Google).If the connectivity was good and they had pressure venting, I could tolerate the app and eventually learn Sony's nuances. But I can't use them if they won't stay connected and make horrible head thuds during exercise - which is the main reason I purchased them.Sorry, Sony. The amazing sound does not make up for all of the other issues. These will be returned. Were they released before they were ready? I think I will wait for the next iteration of the Pixel Buds.

NONE! There is quite literally no difference between when the feature is activated as compared to when it's turned off. Based on the number of other complaints regarding this epic fail, and as an owner of Sony's previous WF-1000XM4 model (which had phenomenal active noise canceling), I must assume that there's a sizeable defective batch that was produced and released to consumers.• The new ear tips don't fit as well as the XM4 ones did for me personally.• The smaller size and new glossy exterior make these exceedingly difficult to extract from the charging case, and I'm constantly dropping them in the process of trying to do so.• Updating the firmware continues to remain a royal pain in the butt. Sony, can you please come up with a better way to do this? It can't possibly be that hard.I really wanted to love these. They don't sound bad, and the battery life is excellent.

The sound quality was as expected from Bose. The set up was easy and quick. However, at the end of the week I was ready to trash them (I sent them back) - they would not stay connected to either my iPhone 12 Pro Max or my MSI WS-75 Workstation. They were good for about 10 minutes, and then would have to reconnect.I then decided to try something different - Beyer Dynamics is a big name in studio monitor quality speakers, headphones and mics. They have a solution - the ""FreeByrds""."" Three drivers in each ear - unsurpassed sound and clarity...""  They did have good sound, they stayed connected, but the noise cancelation was non-existant (The reason that I wanted new NOIsE CANCELING earbuds for). I have a pair of 12 yr old Bose wired earbuds that block more sound than those were, and they aren't (weren't) catigorized as being noise blocking or canceling. The set up was long and complicated. Those should be back at the music store today.So I sprung for about $100 more and ordered a pair of Sony WF-1000XM5's. They stay connected. They sound really good (as good as the Bose?

4.0,Comparison to XM4 and Bose QC2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R357ZLBP3YRC07?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2023",2023-11-23,United States,,"I'll keep it brief since others have reviewed more thoroughly.First thing, and I'm shocked to say this-- they actually are tricky to pull out of the case because of the shape and smoothness.  It's unbelievable that a huge company can make a product so good in some ways and then just like, what, not actually try to use it before mass-production?  It's genuinely worth removing a star for.  They could have put just a ring of textured area or a silicone band embedded; or just a little ribbing.  It would have been trivial, and should have been obvious from the first test.I think I read someone say they wanted a way to distinguish between left and right.  There is a small but obvious bump on the left bud, for this purpose.Bose are more comfortable-- there just is no comparison.  If you get a combination of tips and wings that fit your ear, it's like you've got nothing at all in your ear.  It is THAT good.  The Sony XM4 was irritating by kind-of rubbing against the inner ear when fully inserted.  The XM5 have resolved that by being very slightly shorter.  They are comfortable if you are used to in-ear buds, especially well-sealing ones.  They will never be as comfortable as the Bose.XM5 sound quality is very similar to XM4.  I prefer the sound of the XM5 to Bose for almost anything.  The Quietcomfort 2 really emphasizes a kickdrum and then bass is muted.  It's probably somewhat adjustable in the app EQ, but I didn't try.  Percussion like shakers, cymbals, hats, etc all sound more realistic on the XM5 than the Bose-- the Bose makes them sound both synthesized/""fake"" and undefined at the same time.  Mind you, the Sony is not audiophile grade-- if you have nice cans then you will definitely find the Sonys lacking.  But they're great for what they are, and better than the Bose.Bose takes longer to turn on and connect (several seconds), but they take less time to get comfortably situated in the ear.Noise cancellation-- Bose are noticeably (10-15%) better at cancelling white noises (fans, air purifier, airplane).  So for a long-haul flight where that and comfort are most important, the Bose win.  Sony, however, did better at cancelling out sudden noises and voices, as well as background music.  So for the gym, Sony's win.But really, for most people, it's a toss-up.  I wouldn't recommend upgrading from the XM4, and the difference between the Sony and Bose will mostly come down to preference for comfort.  If you never find earbuds comfortable, get the Bose, be happy, and don't look back.  If you like the Sony sound signature and fit, and are due for a new pair, I do recommend the Sony WF-1000XM5.I'll update this when I figure out a way to mod the buds to be easier to remove from the case.

Are they better than the WF-1000XM4?For me ... yes, with an asterisk we'll explore below.They are lighter and smaller than the XM4s, which is very welcome.The sound quality and ANC are ... probably better.  It's too close.  I couldn't really tell because...They come with absolutely terrible ear tips!The XM4s shipped with high-quality silicone tips in three sizes, as well as squishy memory foam ones in three sizes.  The XM5s only come with a three-size assortment of thick, hard memory foam tips.Not only was I a fan of the silicone ones included with the XM4, but the foamies you get here are rather uncomfortable.  They don't squish much, so they either natively fit your ears or they plain don't work well.  I apparently needed a size in between M and S, as the M's gave me headaches from the girth, and the S's didn't seal, causing them to shift around while walking.Even the too-tight M's still produced a lot of the 'bump', 'bump', 'bump' noises you get when some part of the earbud/tip isn't perfectly stationary while walking.  Lots of people can ignore this.  I'm not one of those people.I tried my old silicone tips from the XM4s, and hooray for comfort!  But the new buds sounded tinny with them, and the ANC suffered horribly.  Clearly Sony retuned the software specifically for foamies.Eventually, I found a set of high-grade aftermarket foam tips which put everything in line.  (I'm now using  Airfoams Pro.)  I never should have had to try multiple tip manufacturers to get top-grade earbuds to function like their predecessor (which worked perfectly right out of the box).

4.0,"Clear, quiet, smaller and lighter than the XM4",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAGFSOGI67D6?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,185 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023",2023-07-29,United States,,"I use a range of Sony headphones and earbuds, from the MDR-Z1R to the IER-M9 to consumer models like the WH-1000XM and WF-1000XM series. It all depends on where I am (at home, on the go locally, or traveling) and what equipment I'm using (a Sony digital music player with a balanced headphone output jack or Bluetooth LDAC support, or a simple iPhone that only supports the Bluetooth AAC codec).My WF-1000XM5 pair arrived July 28, 2023 (the day before I wrote this review). After testing them and completing the initial update to the 2.0.1 firmware (by the time you read this, there may be a newer version), I found that I just left the earbuds in for the rest of the day, whether I was listening to music, making calls, or enjoying some quiet time. They're smaller, lighter, and more comfortable than my WF-1000XM4 pair, to the point that I don't really notice I'm wearing them.Sound-wise, there is a noticeable improvement in bass and in the midrange. I didn't notice much of a difference in treble, although I like less bass and more treble than the average person (hence my choice of the IER-M9 over the two alternatives in that product line).The noise-canceling has improved across the board. As always, it's important to try the different tips, including the possibility that you will need a different size in each ear. I was surprised to see that mentioned in the in-app tutorial!I am used to third-party expanding foam tips for my WF-1000XM4 pair, so we'll see whether third-party vendors offer something similar for the new model. For now, the stock tips work fine. They remind me of the alternate-texture tips that come with the IER-M9.Now, a few flaws, worth mentioning given the price of this product...First, Sony's model numbering is stupid and not consumer-friendly. Normal people can get excited about ""AirPods"" but not about ""WF-1000XM5s"".Second, the charging case, though now significantly smaller, still lacks any sort of finding feature. It would have been a simple matter for Sony to add the ability, through the clunky Headphones Connect app, to make a pair of earbuds in the case play a loud sound so you could find the case if you'd misplaced it. Apple of course makes precisely locating its products very easy.Third, in their hubris, product designers at Sony have made something small and lovely but forgotten about the environments in which it will be used. There is NO tactile feedback to let us distinguish the left earbud from the right. The L and R marks are tiny (just millimeters tall) and the use of dull grey for L and red for R makes them invisible in the dark. If I'm out walking in the evening without the case, have taken off the earbuds for a moment, and am putting them back on, I should not have to use my iPhone's flash to tell left from right.Last but not least, the Headphones Connect app is becoming an ever more elaborate trainwreck. There are just too many options and features. With no distinction between what's essential and what's not, you have to open three tabs in succession, scroll down, and open endless settings panels (each accessed by a gear icon) to cover everything. Pesty notifications come back every time you start the app, even if you deleted them the last time. Sony tries again and again to make you sign up for various accounts, and is of course gathering information about you, your cell phone, and your listening activity every time you use their app. Since Sony's 360 spatial audio only works with a handful of paid, proprietary music apps (a big gap, compared to the more-or-less universal, iOS-level support for this feature with Apple wireless headphones and earbuds), I don't even bother setting it up.Overall, the WF-1000XM5 is an excellent pair of wireless earbuds in terms of sound, noise canceling, and comfort, and Sony could make improvements by renaming them, adding a raised plastic dot to make the right earbud distinguishable by touch, and ditching the Headphones Connect app in favor a lightweight (and ideally, data-privacy-conscious) control panel.",True,Color: Black,[],4.0,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,197.0,90.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 278, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5

I'm happy to report, that after changing the tips to some older silicone traditional Sony tips, they surprised me how nice they were to use. I also was happy about the longer lasting battery, and quality passthrough experience then what I had gotten used to. All in all, these are pleasantly nice once I put the silicone ear tips on. They fit perfect now and have my recommendation. Edit- I've had a little time with them, and the couple things I don't care for so far, is Amazon music service; I disabled nearby devices, because every time I connect buds after accepting update, they offer a service to be ready to play music with a tap. It's good if that's what you want, but not for me at the time. Now the other issue is actually an issue that has me really concerned whether I want to use them long-term. The right ear bud every time I look is connected in the case/paired to my phone which is a dealbreaker if I can't seem to correct. I'm sorry to report this because it's something that matters a lot to me and a reason I would return to the pixel buds pro. Anyway the sound and noise cancellation is second to none , and I can honestly say, they close the pixel buds pro out of the water.

I can see this being a problem after exercise or during rainy weather. Some matte texture would have helped. What's weird is that they make this smoothness a selling point in the marketing material. How much did they test these in the real world?Second, and possibly worse long term, the eartips have a mesh to prevent debris from getting into the buds, but that's it. There is no foam inside the buds. If you need replacement eartips in the future, you'll want to find tips that have mesh protection, but after a cursory search on Amazon I don't see many options with a mesh. Now maybe you're like me and happy with the included tips, but In my experience they will wear out.

5.0,Darn near perfection.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBTBMTTVKCB9I?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,366 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023",2023-07-29,United States,,"I have used pretty much every credible earbud in the last few years. Sony, Apple, Beats, Bose, B&W, Samsung, Klipsch, M&D, and more. I have also used every generation of Sony buds. In terms of overall use and features, these are not a giant change from the last gen XM4 buds. However, there are significant improvements in key areas. Here is the breakdown:Sound: There are moderate sound improvements here, over the last generation Sony's, which were already close to class leading. Sony put a larger driver in here and it makes a difference. Additionally, Sony added a lot of processing horsepower here. The put in their latest chip for audio, but then added a separate chip to handle all of the ANC duties. Sony argues, that by separating the tasks here, they were able to more finely tune the audio. You can hear the difference. Bass is thumping, highs are even more crisp, and the mid vocals definitely pop more. I am no audiophile but these are really good. To me, these sound better than the latest Bose and Airpod Pro buds. You have to get into the really high-end audio companies to find sound this good. As always, you get Sony's LDAC here if you can use it for high-end audio options and the DSEE Extreme tech that upscale regular more compressed audio. The DSEE really shines here. Your Spotify or Apple music app has never sounded so good. I think most folks will be very satisfied with what Sony has done here and, at the end of the day, sound quality is a big reason to make such an investment.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): These are the best ANC buds Sony has ever made which is saying something. They were already 1b to the latest from Bose, but these have improved dramatically to me. The new dedicated chip just gets it done. These buds adjust the ANC to the noise around you. I honestly hear pretty much nothing other than my music when I have these in. The latest Quiet Comfort's from Bose are still at least as good to me in this arena, but that is pretty much the only area that Bose still is really on equal footing. At least in my opinion. Fit really determines great ANC, so while these are great, there is definitely some subjectivity that comes into play here. I think most will be very happy with the results they get here though.Form Factor: This is an area that Sony has absolutely nailed it and I am going to just say, FINALLY! Every bud Sony has made has always had an asterisk for me. ""They sound so good but they just aren't that comfortable"" was what I often told folks. Not anymore. Sony has made these buds significantly smaller and by adding the glossy interior, has created a bud I hardly notice in my ear. They have gone from a ""yeah but"" to a class leader in the fit and comfort space. I really cannot emphasize enough how good these are. These buds have an IPX4 rating so they should handle the gym with no issues. Sony has included a revised version of their hybrid foam tips from last year and they are great. They just hold the buds in snug and really help block ambient sound. Just so so good Sony. Thank you for the thoughtful redesign. I also want to give Sony a nod for the case redesign. Same battery (3 charges) but much smaller. I love it.Battery and Connectivity: The battery life is the same from last year. About 7 to 8 hours of real use. It is fine. Not class leading but not bad either. Connection here is BT 5.3 so the latest. Same as last gen. However, Sony said that these buds will be LE compatible when they finally start rolling this out over the coming year so you can expect even better sound and perhaps even battery life someday soon. This essentially future proofs these buds.Call Quality: Not much to say here other than these are about as good as it gets. Sony added bone conductive tech here and you can tell. Your calls sound great.Intangibles: There are too many features to unpack here. You really need to read all that Sony has packed into these. From the upscaling audio, to one touch audio play, to speak to pause tech to gestures and so so so much more. You can literally get lost in the app. Almost too much is going on here. Regardless, there is almost nothing that these buds can't do. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that Sony has multipoint connection option here as well. It is only two devices, so there are more robust options out there, but this should be fine for most in real life application. Very good stuff.So, should you buy these? If you are an Android user, the answer is 100% yes. Apple users have to consider that Airpods are more tightly integrated into their space. Further, Apple is getting ready to launch their high end sound codec as well, which these will not support. They are still worth considering though as Sony has just made a better sounding product. To me, these might be the best all around buds I have ever tried. From sound to calls to comfort, Sony has just nailed all of it. There are companies that offer buds that do one thing better perhaps, but none are as complete as these in my opinion. So, yes, buy these. You will not regret it.

5.0,Great headphones IF you know how to read,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XHZGBRL7DIF3?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,117 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2023",2023-09-04,United States,,"My review is going to upset some, but unfortunately after reading a few of the negative ones I felt the need to write my own.Background: after going through THREE pairs of Apple AirPod Pro 2 I decided to pick these up, and I have used them heavily over the last 24 hours (~3 hours of yard work in 90F+ heat, ~1 hour in the gym doing weights, ~20 minutes cardio running outdoors).TL;DR: Overall these headphones do what they claim, provide awesome sound quality (note: not an audiophile, audio geek or whatever) compared to my previous Apple headphones, and the ANC is spot on. YOU MUST USE AND CONFIGURE THE HEADPHONE APP to get the full functionality and experience with these headphones. Furthermore, you need to actually CONFIGURE these headphones. If you don't, you are missing 80% of the features (ANC, transparent mode, geofencing), at which point I just order a cheaper pair.Pros:- Sound quality is spot on for the price range.- Personally, compared to the Airpods the fit is a lot better. I do wear foam earbuds a bit with my actual noise cancelling headphones, so I am used to them and prefer them over the silicone ones.- WHEN CONFIGURED CORRECTLY, the ANC and transparent mode blow away the Apple Airpods. Hands down.- The app has some pretty sweet functionality, such as an EQ tutorial which allows you to finetune the sound to what you prefer without understanding frequencies, adaptive mode (basically detects what you are doing, walking or standing still, and either turns on ANC or transparent mode OR however you configure it), and there the gesture thing, although I think is a bit gimmicky, can be cool for some.- The actual controls are configurable on the headphones as well within the app, and they work sell with Mechanix gloves on.- Unlike others, I had no connectivity issues. Phone was in my left pocket, and earbuds were in. I am 6 foot tall, ~225lb for an example of distance between headphones and device.Cons:- You require the app. You have multiple people on here claiming things like ""oh there is no ANC"" or ""oh boy I can't get transparent mode to work"". Yea, because if you read the damn insert that came with the package you would realize the app is required. I will say that there is a TON of functionality that is baked in, but it is somewhat cumbersome to figure out. I am fairly technical, and I even had to Google a thing or two to find the appropriate settings.- The case feels cheap. The Apple Airpods, love them or hate them, has a premium feel to the case, whereas these headphones are not exactly the best.- The adaptive mode is bit of a PITA to configure, especially if you are using these for the ANC to ensure you aren't blowing your ears out. For example, if I whistle it thought I was talking and then would shut the music off. It finally learned that it wasn't me actually talking but whistling, but still an annoyance. Furthermore, the adaptive mode will turn on transparent mode IF you are running/walking, and this occurred when I was using my mower.

Wasn’t worth the cost of repair. Have others from QCY and Soundcore that were surprisingly good for less cost. Also had trouble with refurbished headphones WH-1000XM4, luckily had added insurance. Cut to buying a new pair that have been flawless.Got the Sony WF-C700N a couple months ago to scratch my earbud itch. Very good for the price. If you’re not ready to throw down $300 for the XM5 they’re a great alternative. Not quite as musical, but no gripes anyway. You can get picky about the throwback buttons but oh well.One comment before I get more specific on the XM5. I fully agree with another review that calls out Sony for how complicated their Sony Connect app has become. It could be simplified for people who don’t want to get into the tech so much.Now, how do they sound? I’m impressed and I’m not using them to their full potential. Using with iPhone so Bluetooth SBC codec is the most basic and lowest quality solution (after digging into the codec question a bit more it does appear that the iPhone has the AAC codec also). However, with the help of Sony’s equalizer and DSEE function I’m very happy with the sound. I almost don’t want to try them with a better codec and then have to go back. (Still applies with AAC, DSE does improve sound)I need treble boost for my old ears and having played bass no surprise I like a lot of bass. These don’t disappoint. I did an A-B comparison with the XM4 headphones and they didn’t have quite the low end but good and punchy with good definition between bass and drums.both can become nice and “growly” on the low end.Noise cancellation is very good, not as good as the headphones but after only a couple days I have been quite satisfied so far.Comfort level is better than the XM4 buds, but I’m so pissed I wasted the money now I don’t want to dig them out to compare audio! I think Sony really improved the fit and design to be lighter, more comfortable, and have impressive sound. Let’s just hope they found a better battery.Used overnight and had battery left in the morning but playing audiobook on timer so i couldn’t say how long continuous playback.I’ll update after I’ve had them longer.(Update) battery life seems to be very similar to the XM4. Sometimes I have battery left in the morning sometimes it comes up short.Another follow up, comes with 4 sets of tips but apparently I have very large ear canals as I’m unable to get a complete seal with the included buds. The large felt good at first but when I used the connect app to check for airtight seals I could not get them to seal. Fortunately I have many tips I’ve saved over the years and by mixing, matching, and testing I have a couple that seal. I even tried ordering extra large tips from a couple vendors and they didn’t work either. Nice that Sony is including extra small but what about us with extra large needs! I do have a possible solution on the way, find a video on YouTube that shows how to use Sugro glue rolled up and inserted in the mushroom part of the tip. Press in the ear to get a fit and then allow to cure over night. Hoping it works, I have a few tips I’d like to try this on. Was even investigating custom molded tips but for $150 plus I’ll try the Sugro hack…8/5/23 tried the Sugro hack yesterday. Still have to work to get an airtight fit but it definitely helped.My opinion on the sound has not diminished. Excellent with what I listen too. A lot of classic rock but also new material from Elle King and others. Listening to Lourdes “Royals” a very deep bass which presents low, solid, and clear. You can easily distinguish the bass and drums. The low rumbling bass of Pink Floyd “Welcome to the Machine” couldn’t be much better in any buds. Almost like I could feel it.I’m now using the WF-C700n as my workout and dog walking buds. Sound signature is very similar but the bass is not quite as good. One thing they are lacking is the airtight fit check in the app. I had to use other tips and the Sugro mold hack to get a good consistent fit in both. The included tips are worthless to me and my big ears.I see a lot of criticism of the noise cancellation for the XM5. I have no way to measure so it’s pretty subjective but I’m not disappointed. At least as good as the XM4. But with any ANC earbuds the airtight seal is critical.If you’re not ready to throw down $300 the WF-C700n are a very good alternative, but are not touch controlled, a single button on each side. Not quite as good on the low end but not disappointing either. In direct comparison you can hear the difference.I still think these are 5 star worthy. I’d take off half a star because of the somewhat complex app but if you like to tinker with the sound and features, give it back. People who are not “technical minded” may find it intimidating. I find it useful but jammed with some features I wouldn’t normally use, like automatically changing settings depending on location as an example. Some might find it useful but not me. The equalizer and clear bass functions are excellent. DSEE function makes a noticeable difference in sound quality. Happier with these than I was with the XM4. Just hope the batteries last, I would hope Sony changed from the $70 replacement cost batteries (not including labor) used in the XM4 as apparently so many people had problems with them dying out after a few months.9/22/23Used these today instead of the WF-C700n for my indoor cycling and to walk the dog. Usually I do those activities with the cheaper buds as for $300 I want to take every precaution to protect them. So…more feedback on the ANC. Definitely a difference on the bike with 2 pretty loud blower fans on. The WF-C700n does a very good job in the same situation but I could definitely tell a difference. Could hardly hear the fans at all and the WF-1000XM5 does have the superior sound performance. Note these blowers are loud enough that if I have my Apple Watch to close to them I get the over 90db warning. They’re not 90db from the bike but they are loud. These cancelled almost all the noise. With volume on my music I don’t hear the fans at all.",True,Color: Black,[],3.0,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,767.0,225.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 278, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5
5.0,"Yes, It worth an upgrade!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TYKIZ0H1F9BD?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,26 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2023",2023-09-12,United States,,"I was looking for the best noise canceling earbuds as I was tired of using a mediocre Galaxy Buds 2. So I started my research on earbuds that I can use for long hours and don't want to feel pain in my ears. Since I had Sony over-the-ear headset WH-1000XM4, I decided to go for Sony. I picked up XM4 earbuds from Amazon, connected with my Galaxy S23 Ultra and right away I was blown away by the crisp sound quality of XM4. I used it for a week, however, it was not comfortable at all. XM4 are bigger, heavier and the overall design is bulkier. So I returned those after getting pain in my ear canal and I completely dropped the idea of using in-ear buds. I bought Apple Airpod Pro 2 to counter the experience that I have just had with XM4 because it was cheaper than WF-1000XM5 and was highly rated. Though I am using Android flagship, but Apple Airpod Pro 2 can be configured using an ipad and macbook which I already have so I was able to configure it and use it with my Android phone. Other than spatial sound, I could use the Airpods pro 2 at their best. To my surprise, Airpods work amazing with Android espacially after I installed equilizers and increasing the bit rates. It even sounded better than when connected to an ipad. But within a week, I started to feel that it doesn't create an air tight seal to give the best music quality possible. I almost lost an Airpod without noticing that it fell out of my ear. Also while walking around, moving head too much, Airpods tend to get lose. I gave up on those also as it was not justified to pay premium price but not getting the features I need.So I went to the latest and greatest WF-1000XM5. These are smaller than XM4, lighter, made with premium material and you can tell right away that these earbuds are top notch. I connected my phone, enabled LDAP (Sony proprietary codec for bluetooth) and then up the bitrate in Android developers mode to maximum. Gave it some reverb and slightly increase the mids of XM5 and wow they sounded best of all that I have tried so far. It has memory foam tips, which are not that bad in the ear. I can wear those for hours without noticing that I have something in my ear. It creates a good air tight seal, ANC is amazing, sound quality is great. Some people have complained about ANC not be that good in crowded place, but in my use case I haven't encountered a situation where ANC is not up to mark. I personally think it was worth an upgrade from XM4 and it has given me better music on S23 Ultra than using Airpods. Sony knows how music sound great.

5.0,Fantastic!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D1Q4UOPR0S5H?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023",2023-12-22,United States,,"I bought these because I had a gift card to spend, and in hopes that I could completely separate from my Airpod Pro’s (1rst gen). I wanted to get rid of my Airpod pro’s because I have become so completely fed up with popping them in my ears and having only one earbud connect. That happens about 25% of the time I use them, and of course it’s always right when I’m in a hurry and need them now. I have to reset them every time it happens and frankly I’m fed up with it – unacceptable reliability.So, it’s only been a little more than a week but I haven’t had this happen once. Nor has it ever happened on any of my other true wireless earbuds (Soundcore Liberty 4 NC’s and some cheap no-name sports hook-style earbuds). The Sony’s have had stellar reviews, but my one reservation was that I’m in a full Apple ecosphere, and I had read that if you’re in the Apple ecosphere, you’ll want the Airpod Pro series II. Using anything else would mean missing out on that typical Apple integration – things work great together. Well, I’ve never tried the Airpod Pro II’s, but I couldn’t get myself to reward Apple by ordering another pair of headphones from them after my dissatisfaction with the AirPod Pro I’s.So, how are the Sony’s? Absolutely fantastic and boy, am I glad I went with them! First of all, in terms of integration/functionality with my Apple world, best I can tell so far its flawless. Transitions between my iPhone 15 and iPad Pro are just as smooth as my AirPods were. I can send/receive calls just as easily, and the Sony has one feature I don’t think AirPods have – you can just nod your head to answer calls! I also find the touch sensor vastly superior to Apple’s squeeze surface (or whatever it’s called). Much more intuitive to me, and it works every time on the first try.Another big advantage the Sony’s have over the Airpod Pro I’s is battery life. One reason I picked the Sony’s was better sleep. My wife makes quite a racket sleeping at night and I had read that these were great for sleeping. My Airpod Pro’s were also quite good at that, but they wouldn’t last through the night – only about 4.5 hours (w/NC on). Not sure how long the Sony can last, but I’ve gone over 8 hours (w/NC on) – and they still had some battery left! As for the noise cancelling, I’d say it’s slightly disappointing. I also own the over-ear WH-1000XM5’s, and they have AWESOME noise cancelling! I’d say the WF-1000XM5’s are nowhere near that level – I’d say they are about the same as my Airpod Pro I’s. Good enough to attenuate my wife’s snoring (at least enough that I can sleep), but not completely block it (so I hear nothing at all) as on the WH-1000XM5’s. But of course, the WH-1000MX5’s are way too big to sleep with (full size over-ear headphones). Another minor disappointment is no “find my earbud” functionality, which makes me a little paranoid about losing them, but hopefully not a big deal.Saving the best for last is the sound quality. I bought the big-brother WH-1000XM5’s a year ago and was quite surprised at their sound quality. Same thing here – these sound fantastic! I’m a fairly serious audiophile and have quite a collection of high-end headphones, including one pair of earbuds that are more than triple the cost of these Sony’s (JH Audio J13 v2’s). And all the electronics to go with it (DAP’s, DAC’s, amps, cables, etc.). They took a while to break in properly (maybe 30-50 hours) but they are really wonderful. They are among the most natural sounding earbuds I’ve heard and I’m a bit stumped how that could be possible since it uses crappy Bluetooth. My high-end headphones are fed almost exclusively high-rez files. Bluetooth AAC (can’t use LDAC on an iPhone) is the best I can run, which of course are only a small fraction the bitrate resolution of true high-rez files. But somehow these sound absolutely wonderful – just a natural “rightness” that’s hard to describe. BY FAR the best bass I’ve ever heard from an earbud. They have a confidence, an “assertiveness” (yes, that’s a new audio metaphor) – not aggressiveness - that I just love. I’m not saying that they are flat-out better than my high-end earbuds (my Shure M535’s are my favorite), but I will say they are at least in the same ballpark. I can pop these in and really enjoy listening for hours – and not feel like I’m missing out in not using my much more expensive earbuds. Very high compliment indeed! So, great job Sony! BTW, I read that Sony bought Audeze (high-end true audiophile headphone brand), which means I can’t wait to see what they come out with in the future – if these are as good as they are, I can’t wait to find out what the XM6’s or XM7’s will sound like!",True,Color: Black,[],5.0,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,767.0,225.0,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 278, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5
5.0,Color me impressed - could use a touch of aesthetic though.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VENSGW8O3M27?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023",2023-12-31,United States,,"After having tried a bunch of different bud recently, and usually reverting back to my old reliable pair (Samsung galaxy bud live's) I was impressed by the technical capabilities of these. While in some ways they don't feel quite as luxurious as my Samsungs, or as robust, the sound they managed to pump out of these is pretty wild. Leaps and bounds over my other buds? Maybe not, I find the lows to be pretty comparable, maybe moderately better. The highs are much crispier though, that I will admit. Where this truly shines for me though is the noise cancellation. I was never a big fan of anc in the past as I just simply never needed it, and didn't like the white noise in the background. I travel often for work now and after having tried a few types of bud on the plane, then trying these, wow. Definitely muffles like 90% of all outside noise. Is it as good as having full headphones? Probably not, but given the size of these buds I gotta say I didn't expect this much efficiency. My only issue is the price point, even on sale I'm not convinced I got what I paid for. If I were to make a suggestion to sony, i'd say make some quality of life improvements. Use more expensive surfaces, focus on the design and comfort, and if possible try to lower the profile.

However, the sound quality is the most impressive by far and large. I walk in the gym on treadmills and I can't hear a large fan blowing directly at my head nor could I hear people talking around me, but as far as the audio I can hear rich bass and highs so well that even in previously viewed youtube videos I was hearing things I couldn't before. I also use them while connected to my computer via bluetooth while flying in the sim in VR. These things are incredible!The only drawback I will say is that to adjust the volume you have to repeatedly tap on the left or right bud and sometimes if it doesn't register a tap you may end up having them do one of the quick functions. This isn't that big of a deal for me though as I adjust my volume from my phone or computer.Also, if one bud is out you lose the functions that bud provides.

5.0,The new best headphones,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O5TI0VY1U3LF?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023",2023-12-27,United States,,"I own all the flagship Sony headphones and these are my new favorites.  However there are a couple cons that are worth mentioning.  But first all the obvious pros.  These sound amazing they are much smaller than their predecessor.  The charging case is also smaller and it continues to use USB-C.  Now for what I believe are cons.  First, ear buds are small with a glossy finish making them difficult to get out of the charging case.  You think you have a grip and they slip away. It may take multiple tries. This is a big deal if you're in a crowded place, airplane or public transportation and risk dropping one.  The second con are the rubber earbud tips.  I understand they are the way they are to provide a complete reliable seal in your ear, but are difficult to put in your ear.  The old tips were thinner and ""slipperier"" silicone rubber.  These appear to be thicker rubber with a texture that seals great if you can get them in your ears.  Also, the small in the new tips is the size of the medium previous tips so a small size tip doesn't exist.  Just a couple things to think about.

My AirPods Pro’s were in 2020 and the Bose in 2021. I washed my AirPods and they still worked but beeped sometimes after water got in them. The Bose buds were great too but a little large. Especially with the case they were hard to carry in a pocket. I tried these before a trip with a five hour flight. The sound was the best I’ve heard on these type of buds yet and the noise canceling is absolutely the best I’ve experienced. The battery lasted the entire flight too.  The case is very small and easy to travel with which makes these absolutely amazing. Definitely take the time to fit the eartips and get used to how to insert the earbuds. I used a size too big initially and they slid out of my ears slowly over time and that was annoying. Once I got the right tips in they have been perfect. The bass is good for such a small earbud and the settings in the app are very helpful.One critique I have is for Sony and their perpetually ugly clunky apps.

I had Jabra earbuds and loved them.  The only reason I bought the Sonys is because I lost one of my Jabra earbuds while cycling and the Sonys had great reviews as their top of the line earbuds. I unboxed, charged them, then went through the pairing process.  Cumbersome right off the bat, you have to pair with the earbuds in their case with the lid open and press and hold a small button on the case.  The Jabras can pair with them in  your ears, and they TELL you when pairing was successful.  Every time you put them in your ears, the Jabras then tell you how many devices are connected, the Sonys don’t. The next problem with the Sonys was simply putting them in my ears without touching the touch sensitive pads. Because if you do, you change the setting on the earbuds. The Jabras have a pad that is a button the needs to be pushed.  By the time I’ve got them sitting properly in my ears, I’ve touched the pads so many times that I have no idea what settings I’ve changed. Then once they are in your ears, any time you happen to touch them, by accident or if you want to adjust the bud, you inadvertently change a setting. The touch sequences are ridiculously complicated. You have to touch 4 times in rapid succession just to change the volume and if you don’t touch 4 times fast enough, you’ve changed some other function. I use earbuds for two devices: my TV and my phone.  Both of which worked well with my Jabras.  After pairing the Sonys with both, I take them out of my case and there is no audible confirmation that they are connected.  If two devices are paired, the buds should only play the device that is on.  But the Sonys immediately wake up the phone and start playing the last music app that I had, even though it was closed and the TV was on and paired. If I want to hear the TV, I have to stop the music on the phone and try to connect to the TV. The most frustrating thing, and the “final straw” for me was that once connected and playing sound from the TV, they would randomly cut out after maybe a minute.  OK, so maybe I have some setting in the app wrong, so I go to the phone, open the app, and it says, “Sony Earbuds not connected”.  What?  They were just blaring music in my ears a second ago.  When I go the phones Bluetooth setting, they are connected according to my phone.  Go to Sony Troubleshooting (oh yes, the manual is only available on line, you can’t download it, so if you don’t have an internet connection, good luck reading the manual). Are your earbuds fully  charged?  Are you close enough to the Bluetooth device?  Are the devices correctly paired? Yes to all three, I’m not stupid. Finally, these two devices worked perfectly with the Jabras so it is not a problem with the phone or TV.Perhaps there is some setting that is not right in the overly complicated app, but frankly I don’t have the time or inclination to mess with them any more.

XM3 has THE BEST noise cancelling of any earbuds, and the switch between NC and ambient is seamless.With the XM5 you have two choices for sound: ambient sound, or noise canceling. You can select Adaptive Sound Control and the earbuds will automatically adjust how ambient sound is filtered by learning how you use your earbuds as you move about your environment, and switches earbud settings at the optimal time.  Sounds good in theory, but Adaptive Sound Control in action sucks. I use my earbuds primarily while walking in urban environments, i.e. passing cars, conversations around me, leaf blowers, lawn mowers, etc. and the XM5 are the worst in class for outdoor environments.First, while moving Adaptive Control tests the environment about every 10 seconds; when it does it interrupts the audio for about one second.  So about every 10 seconds the audio is blocked out while the AC ""optimizes"" your sound settings.  Second, there is absolutely NO noise cancellation while walking! In fact the opposite occurs:  the XM5s actually amplify the street noises around me, while simultaneously suppressing the audio sound track!  I went back into the app and reset the ambient sound control such that Ambient Sound was Off, and Noise Cancelling was the only option On. The audio track was not suppressed, but the street noises (especially passing cars and landscape equipment) continued to be amplified.In a quiet, at home, environment XM5's audio quality is good but not superior to the XM3.  Mainly because of the lack of user friendly equalizer settings.  I'm sure this last statement will drive the Sony XM5 developers into a fit, but the new method of arriving at a desired equalizer setting does nothing more than force the listener into choices between preset equalizer defaults; it does not test the listener's ability/preference at discrete frequencies.  The end result is an equalizer setting with little to no benefit over ""NONE"".So, for sitting around the house the XM5s are okay.  For anything else you get better, more reliable, audio at a much cheaper price.",True,Color: Black,[],2.0,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,136.0,108.0,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 278, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5

They call it a repeat operation and its separated to the left and right earpiece now. You have to tap FOUR times to adjust the volume by one increment and every subsequent tap will increment further.

If you don't have something comparable and just want the latest and greatest then these will be a fine purchase. With that said however, they are a disappointing ""upgrade"" to previous generation and even somewhat for other sony true wireless earbuds.I try out a lot of earbuds. So I have tried a ton of stuff on the market from basic low end stuff to Bose QCs and the Sony offerings. I've always been a fan of the sony line of truely wireless earbuds since the first time I tried them. The sound profile has always been much to my liking and I've always felt like the noise canceling worked pretty well.These XM5s however just miss the bar. The bass from these is terrible. There are better bass notes on the lower priced Link Buds S. That said, the sound is generally clearer and higher quality than the Link Buds S otherwise. In fact other than the bass these are definitely some of the clearest and high quality sounding ear buds I have ever tried.As for noise canceling, I really don't know what Sony did here but it's seems to be a step down from the XM4s. If I compare them back to back sitting in the same location with the same ambient noises and noise canceling on, I hear a lot more sounds getting through on the XM5s. I can hear the AC unit in my room with them on where as with the XM4s I cannot. I'm positive I'm using the best ear bud fitment for me (as I said before I buy and try out a lot of different earbuds, so I know how to chose the correct bud size). I don't know if it's just an inferior chip with them trying to reduce size and extend battery, or if it's just bad firmware that needs to be patched.As for the fit / weight, they are more comfortable than the XM4s. I've worn them now for multiple 3 - 4 hour sessions and never had any discomfort from them. They are noticeably lighter and smaller than the XM4s. I will mention the glossy exterior and smaller size does make them a tad tricky to get out of the case. Could also be the magnet holding them in is stronger, but I've slipped trying to pull them out a couple of times now.Battery life I would call on par for modern day ear buds. Nothing amazing, but definitely would consider it good. Even after a 4 hour session with ANC on the lower of the two earbuds was still at 33%.

Unfortunately,  I have watched their top of the line designs (TV's and headphones in particular) change from 'cost no object quality products' to designs that are purposely simplified and cheapened to save in manufacturing costs.  A good example is the change from the XM4 headphones to XM5 models with the later looking like a sub $100 pair of headphones with weak pivot points, poor folding size, large case, cheap plastic, and thin bass sound.  Those headphones at least improved the mids and highs...which I cannot say for these WF-1000XM5 earbuds.  It seems Sony finds some great wins, then removes those that work in the next revisions to be different and does not listen to their customers.  An example is the effective voice confirmations in mode changes that now are replaced with beeps and some modes being removed.  This is very helpful in flights, when there is a lot of ambient noise.These WF-1000XM5 earbuds epitomize this cheap concept in being  too slippery (what happened to the nice matt finish in XM4's), awkward to handle and insert, weird fitting in the case as they rock around not making contact, and exuding a boomy cheap sound.  The case seems like it was designed for a different product.  To be clear, I gave them plenty of time to break in and though they improved...they plateaued way too soon.  I understand cost savings are important, but these earphones are $300 and marketed as their best and these do not exude quality like their previous models and this is immediately obvious.  The gloss finish is very slippery, not ideal for handling and looks cheap.  The attractive bronze (rose gold?) accents from the past are all but gone.  They are moderately comfortable but leak sound making you constantly guess whether or not ambient sound is on or off.  Touch control seems more irregular and modes are removed.  Conversely, I have found my XM4's (I have 2 pairs) to sometimes cause mild pain in my ears over long use which I did not experience with these XM5's though the XM5 for me feel like they are falling out with their more rounded shape.The soundstage is muddy and closed in and does not outperform the XM4 earphones, in my opinion.  Some music with perfect recordings sounds OK, but across the board they fall short in getting the  best out of the music and I listen to many types of music.  Just like the WH-1000XM5 headphones (which I returned to keep XM4's), these are no better sounding than their predecessors and for me the sound quality is first and foremost.  Accuracy has always been Sony's forte but I have found that has changed.  I have high end audio equipment including tube amps, and a full home theater so admittingly I might be a little picky; however previous models from Sony have kept me content and not a single flight I take is without their headphones or earphones.The ANC and phone call quality are very good but as the foam does not seal well there is that sound leakage in my ears no matter which tips I tried or how I turned them...meaning many will have to buy aftermarkets right away to get that softer better conforming ear pad...which is not a requirement with many of their competitors.  I truly feel like Sony's design team did not spend enough time to cross the t's and dot the i's for these headphones and the budget was too low for a high quality design.  The battery life is worse than previous models and I tested them side by side with XM4 using the same settings and same volume.  They are smaller...for those who need to save space but I would prefer sound quality improvements over reduction in size.  They are also more efficient with less more volume from a lower setting on my S23 Ultra.I did the prepurchase for these earphones and use my others daily but unfortunately I returned them and will stick with the previous models as I try others...which is disappointing.

They're not... Not by a long shot.I bought the XM4s because they had every feature you could imagine and all the reviews said they were the best, and I enjoyed them, despite the fact that they became extremely painful to wear after an hour or so. Bought the XM5s because they were supposed to be the same but lighter and smaller, but the pain still came, just after two hours instead of one.Sennheiser was my favorite brand before Sony and the Momentum 3 buds have 90% feature parity, so I ordered a pair to see if they were any more comfortable, and whether I'd even miss LDAC.My first impression was that the Senns felt more premium and the touch controls were easier to use. I loaded up the app and found that to be a much better experience, with far deeper customization options. I set the touch controls exactly how I wanted them - something I could never do with Sony's app - and sat playing with the sound personalization widget for the better part of an hour, marveling at how it was able to highlight the specific tone and details I enjoy most without muffling everything else like Sony's basic eq does. Then I started in on my test reel, and had to swap from Sony to Senn multiple times to make sure I wasn't hallucinating...Sony sound is clean, slightly warm, well balanced, with a surprisingly open soundstage. All in all it's better than average and generally inoffensive. ""Good enough"" for most people, myself included, or so I thought.Sennheiser sound is music injected directly into your brain. The highs soar, the bass thunders, and every drum beat is a Muay Thai whip kick to the cortex. The Sonys are simply laughable in back to back comparison testing.Even when listening to the few streaming services that support LDAC I can't tell any difference from APTx, and the Senn quality absolutely annihilates Sony regardless of source. After a while with the Senns I realized that there hadn't been a single cutout, something I had grown used to with the Sonys. Went running and immediately noticed the absence of the hollow thudding noise that accompanied every footfall while wearing the Sonys. The noise cancellation is close enough as makes no difference, and the ambient mode works well. All the automatic on/off, start/pause, etc stuff is there, and the Senns can connect to 3 devices at a time vs Sony's 2. Best of all: no pain, none. Where the Sonys are very comfortable at first and get increasingly uncomfortable over time, the Senns start off feeling slightly intrusive and then disappear from awareness entirely.Sound is very subjective so I can't promise that everyone will share my experience, but if you appreciate sound quality at all, you owe it to yourself to test them side by side. I honestly can't fathom how an professional reviewer could do so and not put the Senns on top by a wide margin. Having done so myself, I feel like I've been living in the Sony matrix for the last two years, and Sennheiser just unplugged me.",True,Color: Black,[],3.0,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,146.0,104.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 278, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5

Even with aftermarket foam tips, the earbuds are just not loud enough. I work in a noisy environment and it's hard to listen to podcasts with these. The noise cancellation only works if you have both earbuds in. It sounds like it wants to work when using one earbud but only when there's a really loud noise. It cuts the music momentarily and goes back to letting all the noise in. It would really help if it would work with only one earbud in because I wouldn't have any problems hearing whatever I'm listening to. I hate the touch sensitive controls. I wish they had a physical button that gave me a clicky feedback every time I press it. There is a tone whenever you pause or skip but like I said, it's hard to hear in a noisy environment. Most of the time, I have to raise my volume to notice if it paused, skipped or didn't register me pressing the touch sensitive controls. I originally bought these to use while I'm at work but now I only use these at home. For work I use the Beats Studio Buds which are louder, stay in my ear (with comply foam tips), have great audio and have a clicky button for the controls. No more guessing if I pressed the button or not. With the Beats Studio Buds I can now listen to the same podcasts I couldn't hear with my XM5s in the same noisy environment. I just bought the Studio Buds + which have a better battery life than the 1st gen. The XM5s are overrated in my opinion.",True,Color: Black,[],4.0,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,146.0,104.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 278, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5
3.0,"Good size, doesn't block noise with stock tips",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WKBVSP2REH6C?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,33 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2023",2023-07-31,United States,,"My favorite ear buds were the Jabra Elite 75t, but unfortunately the volume in the right bud got too soft and they stopped making them, so I replaced them with the Jabra 7 pros.  The Jabra 7 pros sounded better, but the case was too bulky, the microphones were useless (no one could understand me on phone calls), and they were super glitchy.  Several times it became impossible to use both earbuds at once and I had to reset them, or one of the buds just didn't charge in the case.  I got Elevoc Clear buds just so I could make phone calls, but having two pairs of earbuds was not practical.  I thought of getting the Bose QC 2, but the battery life of 6 hours was just not enough for me.  So when these Sony WF1000xm5 came out with an 8 hour ANC battery life, I thought they might be right for me...The good:  The charging case is tiny, reminiscent of the Jabra 75ts--maybe even smaller.  There's multipoint and all the features you could want.  I had no trouble pairing them with my Pixel 7 pro and my linux laptop.  I've tested on phone calls and people have no problem understanding me.  So I don't know know if the mics are as good as the Elevoc clear, but at least these are good enough for phone calls (unlike the Jabra 7 pros).  Unlike what is claimed in other reviews, there is a small little spike on top of the left earbud, so you can easily tell the left and right apart even in the dark.The bad:  The noise cancellation did not work at all, because the ear tips don't seal in my ears.  Fortunately, the Sony android app will let you test for this, but I tested all four tip sizes and couldn't get any of them to seal.  Eventually what I did was take the tips off my Jabra 7 pros and put them on the Sony WF1000XM5s, and that got a seal.  That's not a great solution because I still might want to use my Jabras as backup.  (Moreover, the Sony ear tips have an ear wax filter, whereas the Jabras don't, so I'm worried this could be a long-term problem.)  I ordered the both the AZLA Crystal and the AZLA XELASTIC tips, and found that the large XELASTIC tips worked well for me, but not the Crystal (even though Crystal is a newer supposedly better product).  So now I have good headphones, but incurred an additional expense and shipping delay for tips on top of already expensive ear buds.Some more minor criticisms:  The buds are a little hard to get out of the case because they are so smooth.  The controls aren't quite as flexible as on the Jabra--there are just two configurations possible for each ear bud, as opposed to being able to attach any function you want to any action (single, double, triple press, etc.).  I experienced one minor glitch, where the passthrough did not work on the left ear bud, even though I could switch between ANC and passthrough by tapping that ear bud; the problem was fixed when I put the ear buds in the case and removed them again.Overall, despite the issues, I'm excited to have a tiny pair of ear buds again that are good for both listening to media and making phone calls.  I just think that for the price, this should be a product that just works out of the box and doesn't require after-market tips.  Maybe my ears are weird, but I've never had a fit problem with either of the Jabra buds I owned, or the two pairs of wired Shure ear buds I had before that.

For a while, I've been seeking for the best/decent earbuds after my Pixel ones wore out.  Multiple website reviews all directed me to these Sony WF-1000XM5.  Thus, I purchased these earbuds and was greatly disappointed to some features/details that weren't mentioned on product pages or reviews:1) Degradable earbud tips - Yep, the ear pieces are super soft foam but biodegradable.  I get the whole trying to limit waste in the environment, but if I'm spending $200+ on earbuds, I'd like for the material to last more than 6 months.2) Case felt like recycled hard foam - Same as above, for the price asked, it's just not right.3) Volume controls - This was the main thing that killed it for me.  Gesture/Touch interface is terrible.  To raise/lower volume, one must repeatedly tap the earbud four times, which only raises/lowers by one level.  The app has options to change some gesture/touch but nothing for volume.  It goes back to my previous nitpicks: If I'm spending way too much on headphones, I better be getting something near perfect.Sound on the earbuds were great, and the fit was the most comfortable I have felt in years.

3.0,XM5 vs XM4 vs AIRPODS PRO 2 -- WHY THE XM5s ARE GOING BACK,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTCP1TRJO3KJ6?ASIN=B0C33XXS56,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2023",2023-08-06,United States,,"Ever since they were released, and until recently, the Sony XM4 earbuds have been my favorite, ahead of my AirPods Pro 2 and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2. I say ""until recently,"" because the most recent firmware updates to the AirPods Pro 2 dethroned the XM4 at the top. In fact, if you haven't heard the Pro 2 running the latest firmware, you haven't really heard them at all. I've had the Pro 2 since release date, too, and while I felt they were an excellent update to the first gen Pro, the XM4s still bettered them in ANC and sound quality. Not any longer. The degree to which Apple improved both ANC and sound quality through firmware updates is not something I would have believed was possible. In fact, for a recent trip that involved a 9 hour nonstop flight each way, I left my Airpods Max headphones at home, only took my Pro 2 earbuds and didn't miss the Max one bit.SO... I was very anxious to hear what Sony accomplished with the XM5s, 2 years after the superb XM4s. And after spending the past week listening to them, I'll be sending them back. My issues:Fit: The only way I could get a ""good seal"" per the Sony app was by using the largest ear tips, which I found grew quickly uncomfortable in my ear. Even then, I had to twist the earbuds in deeply ""just so"" or the app would tell me to adjust them again. WAY too finicky to achieve what was ultimately an uncomfortable fit anyway. I don't have this issue with the XM4s or my Pro 2s. Plus, the Sony XM5 tips include an ear wax filter which I'm assuming is there for a reason, so I'd be hesitant to replace them with more comfortable tips that lack a filter.The Thud: As others have noted, the XM5s very audibly ""thud"" each time your foot hits the ground when jogging, running or even briskly walking.ANC & Sound Quality: Sony has definitely bettered the XM4 somewhat in both areas. Not dramatically, but still there. Measured testing I've seen shows that the XM5 better the Pro 2 a bit in cancelling lower frequency noise while the Pro 2 does better in the mid and upper frequency sound. I'd call it a draw. Similarly, while I prefer the sound signature of the Pro 2 running the latest firmware--it's a more open, natural and less processed sounding to my ear--others might prefer Sony's bassier sound. Since neither is objectively ""better"" than the other, I'd call this a draw, too. BUT... you've got the fit and thud issues with the Sony. If you can't get the fit of the XM5s to ""seal,"" and stay that way, both sound quality and ANC take a big hit. Plus the thuds are a constant annoyance that can overwhelm the sound quality.Bottom line: the AirPods Pro 2 remain at the top of the pack for me. And while the XM5s definitely improve on the ANC and sound quality of the XM4s, they introduce new issues which, for me, negate these improvements and leave the XM4s my preference in actual day-to-day use. For these reasons the XM5s are going back. BUT... if you like the XM5 sound signature, can live with the thudding and can manage to get a sealed fit easily whenever you put them in, you'll be happy with the XM5s.",True,Color: Black,[],7.0,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,146.0,104.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 278, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5

I had previously tried the xm4s, and they were good but too large for my ears and hurt after wearing them just 30-ish minutes. When I got these, I couldn't understand why the reviews had been so good. The ANC was just horrible. Definitely worse than the Bose and the XM4s. I've had them a couple of weeks and tried many different sets of ear tips and couldn't get any improvement. I mostly use earbuds at the gym, and with these, I could still clearly hear background noise and music, even over the sound of my own music. Sometimes the noise comes through so clearly that I can't believe the ANC is even turned on.Finally after two weeks using them, I tried pressing them further into my ears and holding them there. When I do that, the ANC is great, but they won't stay in that deeply unless I hold them, so I'll need to return them.  Apparently these are just not a good fit for my ears and I can't get a decent seal.Other:*The multi-point connection is great and works really well. It's ridiculous that the Bose doesn't have that.*Battery life is as advertised.*These are much smaller and more comfortable than the XM4s. The case size in a lot smaller and convenient.*Having to tap four times to adjust the volume is stupid and annoying.*No ""find my device"" feature. I got a case and attached a Tile. Another ridiculous feature omission.*The earbud volume is not synced to the phone volume, at least not on my Pixel 7. This means that if I use the phone buttons to change volume, it will only change up or down to the point that the earbud volume is set at. If you want max volume, for example, you would have to max the volume on your phone and max it on the earbuds. The Bose were not like this. Adjusting the volume on the earbuds brings up the volume control on the phone.I decided to buy a used pair of the original Bose earbuds. I'd previously owned them and sold them when I got the Bose II. They are big and ugly, and the case is too big, but they worked properly without any of the issues or frustrations I've experienced with the Bose II and Sony XM4/XM5.

With the Bose, the noise cancellation has been (as expected) unparalleled, almost to the point of being downright dangerous (can't hear a thing when these things are on). In addition; without any tweaking, highs/mids & bass have been outstanding across the board with pretty much any genre in my eclectic playlist.Though I'm an Android user, I've been using (until they were recently stolen), the AirPods Pro (1st gen). Not the most comfortable nor best fitting (tendency for randomly popping out during a workout + having to frequently re-twist/screw them into your ear canal every so often) & obvious severe limitations with customization unless you're paired w/ another Apple product, but I had picked them up for a great price & they did their job. This being said, if anyone was unhappy with the fit/seal of the AirPods Pro, then the fit of WF-1000XM5 are going to drive you bonkers.The finish of the earbuds are a beautiful piano black, but removing from the case (which is a challenge) is also a bit confusing of ""how do I put this thing into my ear?"" I felt like I was trying to cram a rock or marble into my ear & even when it was positioned correctly, never felt as if they were secure (always felt & looked like they were on the verge of popping out). Yes, there is noise cancellation, but there was never a seal like the Bose (which may be a good thing for some), so you can still pick up ambient sound to some degree (vs being in a virtual sensory deprivation tank w/ the Bose). Bose, however, did an excellent job w/ the fit directed towards the ear, where the bud literally slides/pops/seals into place with nothing more than a slight nudge (as if it was custom designed for your ear) vs Sony's design, which felt as if actually fitting comfortably in an ear (or just ""fitting in an ear"") was an afterthought.Sound-wise, the highs/mids weren't as crisp as the Bose & the bass was nearly non-existent. I tested w/ the same playlist, with Rock, Rap, Hawaiian, 80's R&B, 90's, etc... & the Sony's (unlike the Bose, particularly w/ some nostalgic bangers from my H.S. days & earlier), did not make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.Outside of the less than stellar performance of the buds (as well as the extremely challenging fit), the design of the case itself (which is deceivingly smaller than the Bose) is also very slippery (a cover/skin, assuming available, is an absolute must), particularly with the buds themselves being nearly identical in size (the Sony's having a much larger overall mass vs the Bose / check out my side-by-side pics comparison). Again, smaller case, beautiful design/finish, but where it matters the most (fit/sound), these pale in comparison to the QC II's...",True,Color: Black,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51MZp36b+2L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51c6AEBRT5L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kAd9SlkuL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51outLUKrzL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51z0S7G+4TL._SY88.jpg']",9.0,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,146.0,104.0,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 278, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5

They fail constantly, you can never rely on them to connect correctly when you put them in your ears.  This is a joke to me, how does Bose not figure this out, especially at $300 price points?!So, I got these Sony WF-1000XM5's.  I hoped I could have ANC _and_ functional Bluetooth.Unfortunately, dear reader, you cannot.Sony has Bluetooth connectivity figured out, but they have no idea what they're doing when it comes to ANC (active noise-cancelling).If you've experienced Bose buds' ANC, you will know that what these Sony buds are doing is a joke.  Sony's ANC is weak, literally it sounds the same if you have noise cancelling on or off, and the ""ambient sound"" mode with the slider feels pointless, there's no ""medium"" ANC that feels good like there is with Bose, the _maximum_ ANC for these WF-1000XM5's is weaker than the low-middle setting on my Bose QC ii's.It's not even close, I seriously cannot put what Sony calls ANC in the same league as what Bose has.  Bose's ANC is phenomenal.  For autistic people, it is literally life-changing.  If you need ANC, do _NOT_ get these buds, don't let the price or the brand fool you: Sony cannot do ANC, certainly not at the level needed for those with clinical auditory sensitivity.  Sound is fine (I guess, I don't really care, ANC is what I'm here for), Bluetooth works well (yay!), but who cares?  The noise-cancelling is a joke.

Now to the poor ergonomics....the ""look"" of the earbud is very nice, but when you want to get it out of the case, the smooth surfaces and the strong magnet made it difficult to remove the earbuds from the case (""hair pulling"" experience), thus, a 3-star instead of a 5-star review.  It made me wonder if the manufacturer even tested or used this earbud.  One more quirk, If you want to use it with more than one device, you have to manually pair it with each device (i.e. push a button on the case 3 times with the earbuds in it).  Once you paired it with each device, you still have to manually connect manually when you switch.  For example, if you want to switch it from a phone to a computer, you disconnect it on your phone first, then you have to manually go to your computer and ""connect"" to this earbud before it works.  You'll have to do the reverse order when you switch it back to your phone.

I don't want flat boring sound I want energetic sound good solid bass good kids and great highs with a wide Soundstage. For my ears I Def prefer the liberty 3 pro to these. Not just cuz they have more bass and better mids and highs bit there is Def more detail in songs. I hear more vocals and instruments with soundcore vs these.

They sound great, the noise cancelling is absolutely top tier, the comfort (subject to ear anatomy) is spot on due to their oval shaped nozzle and silicone tips, I can have them in for 6+ hours with 0 discomfort. For anyone with bad hearing they get plenty loud and will serve anyone in noisy environments. The audio fidelity isn't compromised when noise cancelling is turned on and the buds do not have a very big foot print. These also support high resolution audio for those who have phones that support the LDAC codec but for iphone users you're out of luck, only AAC for you.

The plastic finish doesn't give you a texture that aids in gripping them at all and you'll likely drop them if not careful.They do stay well in my ears but I know if I did anything rigorous they would fall out as the only thing keeping them in my ears is the silicone ear tips however I think if there was more points of securement then it would likely compromise the comfort so for me I'm okay with that.I do wish the battery lasted longer but that's not to say they don't last long enough, it's just that I'm a truck driver and so listening to music, podcasts, talking on the phone with noise cancelling on will cause me to put them on the charger sooner than I personally want to. They do offer quick charge so docking them for a few short minutes gets me back into the conversation within a few short minutes. The companion app needs a custom EQ option.

Overall I am impressed. I did not expect it to sound better than the Sony and Bose but they did. Multpoint seemed to work well with my Windows 10 laptop and S22 Ultra. I did see that my app crashed a couple of times but I believe that is just a bug that needed to be worked out. I found when I was actually in the app, I did not have issues when I pressed the buttons on the earbuds, I did not have issues. It was when I wanted to adjust the ANC and the app was running in the background, it seemed to want to crash.

2.0,Very disappointing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R385G1GYP7G9HM?ASIN=B09Q31SGTP,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2022",2022-07-14,United States,,"I'm not a super audio nerd, but I've dealt with music all my life and worked in radio broadcasting, sound editing, mixing, composing, producing, and other stuff for over a few decades. I know what ""good"" sound is, for different uses & scenarios.After researching lists of best bluetooth earbuds, these popped up highly on a few well scouted lists. Ordered them, and almost immediately the trouble began.First off - the app. Completely useless. I'm sure it's probably abandoned by now, it refused to get past the ""can't see your device"" screen for 4 different devices I tried to connect it to. It would hook up to Bluetooth just fine, but app wouldn't work at all. Not one time. Chatbot help was in Chinese. No manual in the box, not even a QR code scan thing. No warranty info. Normally I wouldn't care so much, but without being able to check or toggle them in LDAC mode was very frustrating. There's no reason the app shouldn't work. Also, I read there is no in-app manual EQ. Anything that wants to even begin to think of calling itself ""audiophile"", needs to start from there with its app. Inexcusable if it's not in there.Second, the fit (for me personally) was very subpar. They come with different silicone tips, but the largest size & smallest size aren't that different, and if you put real quality foam tips on them it improves a lot, but then they won't fit back into the case. They never felt like they were ""in"" my ear all the way making a good seal. I always wanted to fiddle with them. This of course depends on your anatomy. The active noise canceling however did work a little, and had 3 noticeable different modes - ambient sound, off, and on. Figured that out randomly by tapping the earbud 3 times. Almost like that's something that should be explained in an included manual or something.Third - and most important (and subjective), the sound. They were...fine. Average. Nothing amazing in my opinion, and far far short of all the gleaming recommendations I've read. For headphones, some of my experiences go from MDR V-700S, HDJ-1000s & AT M50xs for spinning records, 7506s, HD280s & Fidelio X2HRs for editing, Bose qc35s & WH1000 XM2s for over ear Bluetooth headphones, to Google pixel buds series A & Shure SE215s for Bluetooth in-earbuds to name just some.In direct comparison, the pixel buds A sound a little better, fit a little better, have an actual usable app & great Google integration, and are almost $50 cheaper (give or take, depending on sales) than the Evos.In a completely different league though, are the Shure se215s. These things (to me) are probably the best pick you can get for affordable bluetooth IEMs. They fit well with good 3rd party eartips, and sound incredible, especially for the price. The sound stage is wide yet isolated, separation and distinction is great, bass is deep & booming & punchy but not muddy, and bright, wide, non-harsh highs. They're 5 times the headphones the 1more Evos are. Plus, they're usually under 100$. They're worth 3 times that, easy.I could go on and nit pick more about other little things, but my point is made. They're just not worth it to me. Audio is such a unique, personal thing, that these may sound & fit amazing to you, and you'll think I'm crazy. This is just how my ears hear them.

For the price these should be over $300! Only 3 downsides however to keep in mind, 1st one is the default and preset EQ sound settings. They're very low quality and low end. Exact same thing when it comes to Apple products. Not the best sounding at all. However the native Sound ID and Wavelet EQ from the Play Store combined together, create a truly magical combination to make up for this flaw. 2nd is the unreliable amount of software updates and improvements over time. At this time the rating of the app on the Play Store is 2.8 out 5. I personally do not know how long these will be supported, since this is a third party brand that is not very well known compared to other brands. The lack of advertisement or endorsements for it to be overly well known along with low market competition and mixed reviews. Still nonetheless, highly recommended and a great brand. Very underrated but totally worth it. 3rd and final one has more to do as a hardware related issue, which has nothing to do with the headphones or the brand themselves, but with Sony's Bluetooth codec LDAC. For those who are unaware it favors sound quality over sounds stability. So the connection is unreliable. Even when you're only a few feet away, the sound can drop and come and go. However, if the devices are right next to each other or very close by. This won't be an issue. Otherwise everything works as it should. If you switch over and use the standard SBC or AAC codec you won't have this issue at all. But quality will be compromised over in favor of stability. That is the only downside to LDAC, the headphones are not at fault or to blame.",True,Color: Black,[],4.0,B09Q31SGTP,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09Q31SGTP?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09Q31SGTP&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,156.0,65.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 94.66, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': {'value': 124.99, 'currency': '$'}}",1MORE Evo

I'm trying to decide between the Jabra Elite 7 Active and 1MORE EVO wireless earbuds, both sound great but the Jabra Elite Active has more features and the ANC really work. 1MORE EVO is missing some features with a really great sounding wireless earbud that I'm hoping a software update will rectify. The 1MORE EVO touch options are from 2, 3, but need option 1 and long press features added and for the ability for each earbuds custom settings selection. I like the soothing sound features (should be binaural beats). I also like the SoundID which is really nice. The preset EQ along with custom EQ choice, for me I use the SoundID. The touch features are ok but would really like to see a press button option built into the earbud design. I feel this would make it easier to use and responses will be more precise. I love the quality build and feel of the case and the fact that it's iq (wireless) charge capable. The ANC could definitely be better. it's really hard for me to make a decision between 1MORE EVO and the Jabra Elite 7 Active.

4.0,Great utility and features marred by lousy fit; I really liked them so I rigged up an alternate fit.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HMJBR48YNZF2?ASIN=B0B72HHWTZ,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023",2023-01-18,United States,,"I compared these earbuds against the Pixel A buds, which cost a little less as the LG was on sale at time of this review (~$100 for Pixel vs ~$130 for LG). The LG buds cost a little more but they bring lot to the table: great sound, active noise cancellation, better dust and water resistance, customizable controls, UV light cleaning, and the ability to connect the case to the 3.5mm jack on any device to stream audio to the earbuds. That last option is surprisingly useful when connecting to exercise equipment or something that doesn't support blue tooth (such as airline seat displays).Despite all that, I have two gripes about these earbuds. The first is there's no off button. (This is unfortunately common with earbuds.) You're expected to be wearing them, or put them into the case to recharge. I sometimes only wear them for a short time and instead of topping them off again I'd like to just put them on table. However, they stay active and slowly drain the battery.  They do better than the Pixel A buds (which last about a day sitting on a table, these did 2+ days), but a long tap to turn on/off would be a nice feature. I want to avoid constant recharging to maximize the usable battery life.The second gripe is the lousy fit, at least for me. They're supposed to go into the ear and rotate into place, snugly sliding into the inner lobe of the ear. I included two pictures from the manual which shows them inserted, and rotated into place. I'm not sure if I just have odd ears, but none of the 3 sizes of fins included will fit my ear. My ear doesn't have a well defined inner lobe for the buds to slot into.  As a result I swapped the fins between the left and right buds so they point backwards (bigger side towards back of head). I can then rotate these the other way to fit the back of my ear, similar to how the Pixel A buds fit. It's not great (the Pixel A fits better with its ""tail""), but its not uncomfortable. The looser fit is worth it for the other great features these earbuds offer. If they fit your ear, these are 5 stars.",False,,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512NAe8y2bL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512fYM5lNoL._SY88.jpg']",3.0,B0B72HHWTZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B72HHWTZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B72HHWTZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,20.0,4.0,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 129.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",lg tone tf8
