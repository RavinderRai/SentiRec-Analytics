Sony WF-1000XM4,"If you want the best true wireless earphones, the Sony WF-1000XM4 has to be in the discussion among the most popular models. It has its foibles, but it's probably the most mature stab at the true wireless design that includes ANC. Still, the price is tough to surmount.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/EcosCxU_GEU?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Apple AirPods Pro (1st generation),"For just $50 USD more than the original model with the wireless charging case, this is definitely the pair of buds to get. The AirPods Pro (1st generation) sounds better than the originals and has a way better fit and active noise canceling to boot. If you have an iOS device, just get this.

Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds,"The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are a competent set of wireless in-ears, but an overly-bassy sound and a high price may deter some. For others, it's an extremely safe pick at the $300 price point owing to its Snapdragon Sound support.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vsE8xVN6rE?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation),"The Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) modestly improves upon the first-generation AirPods Pro and features the same iconic look. Apple's upgraded H2 chip begets better active noise canceling (ANC) and battery life, while the case's U1 chip and integrated speaker lets you precisely locate it from the Find My app. If you own an iPhone, the new AirPods Pro is an obvious choice but you do have others too!",https://www.youtube.com/embed/icUWvqtJfUI?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Sony WF-1000XM5,"The Sony WF-1000XM5 takes notes from the success of its predecessor and runs with it. Featuring a more comfortable design, outstanding ANC performance, and fantastic battery life, they have secured their place as one of the best noise canceling earbuds on the market.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPFM8x1LzwI?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Apple AirPods Max,"While the Apple AirPod Max is a great pair of headphones with best-in-class active noise canceling (ANC) and a good sound signature, it also has a few annoying quirks that make it very obviously an Apple product. If you live in the Apple ecosystem and already love your AirPods Pro, then the AirPods Max is more of the same just in a pair of over-ears.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/FbNTNhNm0hE?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Bose QuietComfort 45,"The Bose QuietComfort 45 has all the parts to be a great ANC headset, but it doesn't quite have the finish. Sound quality isn't all that great, even if the ANC is among the best in class.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/42m3l6DDtec?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Bose QuietComfort 35 II,"The Bose QuietComfort 35 II have some of the best noise canceling in the business, and they're regarded as one of the most comfortable headsets around. With a great default frequency response, travel-friendly design, and solid mic system, there's plenty to love about the QC 35 II.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJj5oM7rWvg?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Sennheiser ACCENTUM Wireless,"For a set of ANC headphones that cost roughly half of what the top-end competitors do, there's a lot to like about the Sennheiser ACCENTUM Wireless headphones. However, the ANC is a little on the weak side, and the microphone doesn't reject noise all too well. Still, this is one of the best value buys on the market at the moment.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFO6BsO8Yhg?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Beyerdynamic DT 990 PRO,"For less than $200, it's not hard to understand why the DT 990 PRO is considered to be a classic pair of cans for audio producers and music lovers alike. If you don't want to splurge on Beyerdynamic's updated line of DT PRO X headsets, then this is an absolute steal.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oK0jW4wEzg?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Sony WH-1000XM5,"The predecessors to the Sony WH-1000XM5 were king of the hill, and this new headphone takes that crown. With new drivers, features, and design, the Sony WH-1000XM5 is an intriguing set of headphones among the flagship active noise canceling (ANC) devices on the market. It excels in travel or at the office, in particular.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/crn0bd7EtSQ?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
HD 560S,"The Sennheiser HD 560S is a rock-solid choice if you're aiming to grab a set of headphones that live by the computer but don't break the bank. They're not going to make you forget about ultra high-end headphones, but they offer extremely good performance for the price at the tradeoff of build materials being a little cheaper.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbzq3rOrEbI?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Beats Studio3 Wireless,"The Beats by Dre Studio3 Wireless is a great gadget, but was hard to justify for the original $350 USD price tag. Today, however, you can easily find this headset for less than $200 USD, making it a much more appealing, albeit outdated, option.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWoS3egI_9o?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Nothing Ear (2),"The Nothing Ear (2) takes an unconventional approach to true wireless earbuds with its Android and iOS friendly design. It features the LHDC and AAC codecs, alongside some luxuries like ANC and a comprehensive app. Despite having some considerate features like IP54 and IP55 ratings for the buds and case respectively, the app's generated personalized sound and ANC don't feel custom. Put in the leg work and the lightweight earbuds might just outdo the price tag.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/rq4scTjb5rA?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Razer BlackShark V2,"The Razer BlackShark V2 is among the best gaming headsets on the market, in its price range or not. It's got better isolation than some noise canceling headphones, more accurate sound most gaming headsets, and it's comfortable enough to wear for hours without overheatingâ€”what more could you want?",https://www.youtube.com/embed/__4ph42HnQA?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Microsoft Surface Headphones 2,"The Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 is cheaper than many of the best consumer ANC headphones that Sony and Bose have to offer with features and specs that go toe-to-toe with them. Plus, this headset looks absolutely gorgeous. It has its drawbacks too: you can't disable ANC without enabling ambient passthrough, and the touchpads are easy to trigger by accident. Still, this is a great headset for conference calls.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJEvKOy6zys?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Sony WH-CH710N,"For around $100 this is a great option for anyone that wants good active noise canceling but doesn't want to break the bank doing so. While it has plenty of flaws, it's still a solid pair of headphones overall that I would recommend to anyone with a hard budget. ",https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRCPscBTSS0?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Google Pixel Buds (2020),"The Google Pixel Buds (2020) is a great pair of true wireless earbuds for Android users, and more specifically for Google Pixel phone owners. With these earbuds, you can access Google Assistant with just your voice and take advantage of live translation with Google Translate. The Pixel Buds (2020) is no longer available, so skip down to our ""Verdict"" section to learn more about Google's next flagship buds, the Pixel Buds Pro.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKqCbrWPdD0?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Sony WF-1000XM3,"Wireless earbuds are a dime a dozen, and the Sony WF-1000XM3 makes it easy to justify the cost. The design and comfort are good, and the connection strength is consistent. While the lack of aptX or LDAC support is a big drawback, DSEE HX processing improves low-quality audio files. If you want stylish active noise canceling (ANC) earbuds, the WF-1000XM3 needs to be at the top of your list.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/69e3Hw-dE_4?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700,"While the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 can't beat the Sony WH-1000XM4 at active noise canceling, they still does a great job. These cans are  exactly the upgrade that Bose needed to make, and their beautiful design and excellent sound quality will attract many music lovers.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbrOQLrUIKk?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Skullcandy Push Wireless,"While the Skullcandy Push might not be the nicest pair of buds on the market, it nails some of the most important aspects of a good pair of buds including battery life and fit. This is no longer available but you have a host of earbuds to choose from instead.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/aytcUwZ9pcA?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
JLab JBuds Air,"If you want a pair of one of the best cheap true wireless earbuds, the IP55-certified JLab JBuds Air is it. While one could argue that nothing is groundbreaking about the JBuds Air, we at SoundGuys say that the sheer value of the product is.",https://www.youtube.com/embed/TfvXGqJ4gTs?autoplay=0&mute=0&controls=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundguys.com&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1&widgetid=1
Razer Nari Ultimate,"Although there are better ways to spend $200, I definitely enjoyed my time with the Razer Nari Ultimate. If you're looking for a unique feature that provides a new experience while gaming or listening to music, these are an interesting choice. That said, the micro USB charging, inconsistent sub feature, and large size are definitely things to consider.
