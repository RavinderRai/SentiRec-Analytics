0,0L4tO4HDjnU,Sony WF-1000XM4 Earbuds Review - 6 Months Later,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L4tO4HDjnU,6 Months Later," The Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, which is a mouthful of a name, sit towards the top of the earbuds market in terms of price and quality, but are they good enough to justify their $279 US dollar price? And why would you get them over the AirPods Pro or the new Sony Linkbuds S? I'm going to answer all of those questions and I'll go into why these buds have become my favorite to use over the past six months. Now, the first thing that sets the Sony XM4 earbuds apart from me from other earbuds that I've used is their fit. Unlike other buds like the AirPods Pro and Beats Fit Pro that I’ve tried where part of their plastic housing sits closer into your ear canal, only the tip of the Sony XM4s goes into your ears, similar to the design philosophy Google has used in their Pixel Buds design. This results in the Sonys being surprisingly comfortable to wear for in-ear buds. Now even though these are in-ear earbuds, which means they create a seal in your ear canal. Sony has actually outfitted them, in their design, with a spatial vent. And that eliminates that plugged ear feeling you can get with other types of earbuds. Another thing that helps makes these buds comfortable is the polyurethane foam material the noise isolation tips are made out of. And this helps give these buds the absolute best noise cancellation. I've experienced on a pair of earbuds. In fact, they're comparable to over the air headphones, like my AirPods, Max Bose 700s, and even the new Sony XM5s and to see our long-term reviews of those headphones as well as our upcoming reviews of the WXM5s and Sony Linkbuds S, make sure you subscribe to the channel. Now over the past six months, I found myself picking up these earbuds over almost every other audio device I own because their noise cancellation is great. And they've got a slim profile and they're great for situations like going out on a walk, they'll cut out on traffic noise so I can still hear my music and podcasts. They also have wind noise detection, which hasn’t been perfect, but does seem to keep the wind noise to a minimum when noise cancellation is enabled. Also, these buds feature a transparency mode, which you can just tap to enable and the buds will use their external microphones to pump in sound from your surrounding environment, so you can hear what's going on around you. It's not the best transparency mode I've ever used, like on the AirPods Max, but it's still pretty good and the mic quality on these buds, by the way, I would say they're about maybe a little bit above average, but they're not the best for phone calls that I've ever used, but it'll still get you by. Now, the next feature I absolutely love about these buds is their sound quality. It's excellent. Then XM4s have 6mm custom drivers which give them great bass, clarity, and overall, they have one of the best sound profiles of any buds I’ve tried. They also support Sony’s LDAC codec which gets you higher quality audio over bluetooth. LDAC is supported on many Android devices but if you have an iPhone, you’re out of luck and stuck with just the AAC codec. Another great use case I found for these buds is actually while cooking. And I think this has probably become my number one use case for them because their noise cancellation is so good. It still allows me to fully listen to music or a podcast while I'm cooking and making noise like banging pots around or sizzling meat or vegetables on a skillet etc. And the come with and IPX4 water resistance rating, so if you get a few splashes on them while cooking or if you wear them in the rain, you should be fine. Now, another scenario, I use these buds for a lot is when I podcast and clean. And again, this is due to the noise cancellation, but it's also due to their slim profile with your ears, unlike over the ear headphones, when you wear something like the AirPods Max or Sony WXM5s, I'm always worried about when I'm cleaning that I'm going to bang them into something and nick part of the headphone. But with these earbuds because they're so slim, you don't have to worry about that at all when you're cleaning around the home. Now the next feature I've really enjoyed about these earbuds that has been great is their multi tap gestures. The earbuds have a touch surface that can register a single, double, or triple tap, plus a long press, which is something most other buds I’ve tried just can’t do, expect for the Pixel Buds. You can customize what you want each tap to register as in the Sony app. I have mine setup so you tap once for play/pause, twice to skip forward, and three times to skip back, and long press for the phone assistant on the right bud, and I’ve setup the left bud to control the noise cancellation. So one tap for noise cancelation, another tap for transparency mode. The Sony app, it’s a bit weird but overall it does allow you to do what you want. The weird thing about it is they stuck in a badge system to try and reward you for using the product more, which is stupid.You know what will make people want to use a product more? You make a good ****** product that people want to use. Lucky enough for Sony, they did that with these. Another issue a lot of people run into with buds in general is their connection. With these buds, I haven’t had any issues with their connection with the many devices I’ve tested them with, and their range is very good. I can have music playing on my phone a few rooms away and still listen to everything on these buds without any cutouts. When the buds finally need a charge, their case has wireless charging built in which I’ve found convenient and they also have USB-C. I’ve never run out of battery while listening to these and they’re rated for 8 hours of battery and the charge in the case will get you up to another 16 hours. They also support quick charging, so 5 min of charge will get you 60 mins of listening time if you’re in a bind. The battery case makes it very easy to tell when they need a charge because the large LED at the front will glow amber when you take the buds out of the case and it’ll remain amber after you close the case. The only thing I think this case is missing is a button to press for bluetooth pairing, like the new Sony Linkbuds S case has. To bluetooth pair the earbuds you need to put them in your ears and then press and hold both buds until you hear an announcement that you’ve entered bluetooth pairing mode. In terms of size, the case is smaller than the previous generation of Sony’s buds and come in a better shape in my opinion. Though it’s still a bit larger than an AirPods case, however, it’s small enough to still fit in my pants’ inner pocket comfortably, so I haven’t had any qualms about the size. Now, speaking of AirPods, let's talk about why I think you would go with the Sony buds over Apple's noise canceling AirPods, The AirPods Pro. I think you would go with the XM4s over the AirPods Pro if you want buds that have better noise cancellation, a more comfortable fit, a longer battery life, and because they come in both black and silver where the AirPods only come in one color. Now, the Sonys are missing a few features that AirPods get you as an Apple user, mainly automatic switching between Apple Devices, better mic quality, and spatial audio Now if you're an Android user, I think these are a no-brainer if you want a solid pair of noise canceling earbuds with some of the best noise cancellation you can probably get in a pair of earbuds right now. The buds also support Google’s one tap fast pair and overall, they’ve worked great on my Samsung and Pixel phones, plus with Android you get LDAC quality streaming. The main question I think for Android users with these buds is why would you go with these over the Sony Linkbuds S? The Linkbuds S recently came out from Sony at $199 US dollars and have noise cancellation which isn’t as good as the XM4s, a shorter battery life, slightly worse audio quality, and no case with wireless charging, but they’re $80 cheaper and are generally even more comfortable to wear with a slimmer profile. I certainly think these are going to be tempting for those who don't need or want the absolute best noise cancellation in a set of earbuds like the XM4s and would rather save 80 US dollars. Next, let's talk issues. After six months of using these earbuds, the only issue I ever ran into is when I had them in and I turned transparency mode on, on occasion it would just turn off transparency mode without any input from me. I think this is likely due to Sony’s adaptive sound controls feature switching between the walking and still/sit settings, but turning that feature off fixed the issue. Generally I’ve been impressed with the sound controls feature and it can be useful to pump in more ambient noise from the outside world when I go on a walk, versus when the buds detect I’m just sitting down. And you can also take this feature one step further by enabling location tracking, so the Sony app can learn your sound preferences based on your location, But overall, since I basically work from home and just walk in the surrounding area, I haven't really utilized that feature. So that’s everything I like and dislike about the Sony WF-XM4s, now let’s talk recommendations. Are they worth the $279 price that they retail for? Well to me, they are absolutely the best earbuds I have used in terms of noise cancellation and they have a fantastic eight-hour battery life. So to me yes, they have absolutely been worth that price. However, given Sony has recently released the Linkbuds S, I think a lot of people may for those instead.. Now I've only had the Linkbuds S for about a week now, so I can't give you a definitive opinion yet on whether or not I think it's fine to go with these over the XM4s or if the XM4s are definitely worth that extra $80 US dollars, but I'll be sure to do that in the full review of the Linkbuds S.

1,hIWn_RjN-Wg,I&#39;m ditching my AirPods Pros - Sony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIWn_RjN-Wg,ShortCircuit," (wind rushing) (slow music) - As much as I love the AirPods Pros, I have to admit that daily driving them with an Android phone is not the greatest experience. Not because Apple couldn't make it so, but because they choose not to. Oh no, you aren't enough our customer, you have to buy more of our products to deserve to be able to update your firmware. Which is why I'm super, super excited about Sony's WF-1000XM4s. They need a better name for these things. It's like, do I want AirPods Pro, or do I want WF-1000XM4? I'm really hoping that I want the WF-1000XM4. These have Sony's new integrated V1 processor, which is supposed to give them much better active noise cancellation than their previous generation product. They also have actually a comparably-sized battery case compared to the AirPods Pros. Look at that, it is a little bit thicker, but the most important thing is whether it passes the little pocket test for me. Okay, Dennis, little pocket test. Ah, it's a little bulky. It's a little bulky. Here's the AirPods Pros for context. - [Crew Member] No one uses that pocket. - [Linus] Yes they do, they use them for AirPods, I'm starting this trend. (crew laughing) I'm a trendy kind of guy. Charging is handled with USB type C. And opening it up, we can see a little charge indicator right there, and the earphones themselves. Okay, so much like most other wireless earphones, they've got these little pushpin connectors that charge the actual earphones themselves. So you're supposed to get eight hours with active noise cancellation enabled, and then another 16 hours from the battery charging case for a total of 24. Why do I keep comparing them to the AirPods Pro? Because, spec for spec, they're pretty darn close. Now we actually got two versions, we got the white one, and then we also got this press kit that has the black one. And I wanted to see both because, as much as I like the AirPods Pros, I don't like the color, I don't think anything that you stick in your ear should be white, and I would really rather have black earphones, so this is the one I'm most excited about. Okay, so here's the color. Ooh. Okay, I can see how people could get into the kind of earthy-toned white ones. I wouldn't even call it white, it's more of like... It reminds me of stone, kind of a stone color. But the black ones look pretty sharp. Oh, look at that. All recyclable packaging paper. What do we got in here? Okay, so they come with the medium tips pre-installed, and then they also include small and large ones color-coded, and you get a type C charging cable. I don't know if my high expectations are because I think they will be good or because I'm just really, really hoping that they're good. Let's start with just a fit test. Interesting, they're using a memory foam style ear tip. The advantage of these is they provide an excellent seal against the ear canal with very little noise bleed, but the disadvantage is that they are not the best in terms of durability. Now apparently they've got four microphones total now, so two on each one. One microphone on the outside, that's gonna be for hearing ambient sound around you that it needs to cancel. Oh wow, this noise canceling kicked in. I can barely hear myself talk now. I mean, I can inside my own head, but that... Just everything went away. And then they have a second microphone on the inside for checking that the noise canceling is working well. So the four of them all work together. Let's go ahead and get these paired, though, and then we'll try it out. Look at that, just showed right up. Connect. The ANC on these is eerily good. Like, I... - [Crew Member] Can you hear what I'm saying? - I mean, I can tell you're talking, Brandon, but I... - [Brandon] You can't really hear me? - I can read your lips, I can't really understand. - [Brandon] I'm speaking at a normal volume but you can't hear me. - Just barely. - [Brandon] Wow! - It's pretty good in terms of the pressure feeling on my ears as well. I would say it is maybe not quite as good as the AirPods Pros, but it's also a significantly stronger active noise canceling effect, that's really, really impressive. I would say a lot of that probably comes down to using the foam style ear tips rather than like a silicone style ear tips. But obviously the microphone type plays into it very heavily as well. So when I'm running it's gonna let ambient sound through. And then you can decide exactly what level of ambient sound you want to allow through. So all the background noise of the warehouse just went away, but what if I talk to Jono? - [Jono] Hey, how you doing? - Yeah, I can hear you, but it's quiet. If I had music on, I probably wouldn't be able to hear you. Sorry, the noise canceling, sorry, what? - [Jono] Send your ear pics. - Send your ear pics, that's creepy! - [Voice Assistant] Remove the headphones from your ears. Next, turn your face forwards and fit it within the frame on the screen. Please move the camera away from your head. Turn your head slowly to the right. Captured photo. - [Linus] What the? That's my left ear, apparently. Hold on, why don't we try that again? Okay, got my ear that time. - [Voice Assistant] Please capture photo. - Analyzing your ears, this will take approximately 30 seconds. This video is brought to you by MANSCAPED.

So within the app you can prioritize sound quality, so it'll use the highest quality codec that it can. It does support LDAC, so that's pretty sweet. Or you can prioritize a more stable connection. And then I found out what DSE extreme is, so maybe I don't have to reactivate my Apple Music subscription, because supposedly it'll actually use the V1 processor to upscale more lossy files. So here we go. This is great. All the EQ presets you could want, or just off. You can set a couple of custom ones. That's awesome. Wait, manual, how do I adjust it? I can't do it. Okay, well whatever, if that actually works, then I guess it'll be pretty neat. These sound great. Like, they sound really good. Punchy, not overdone, great clarity in the highs. Now I feel like I gotta throw in the AirPods Pros just to kind of side-by-side them. The AirPods Pros, to be clear, are not the benchmark against which all headphones are measured, they're not great sounding headphones. But what they are is excellent active noise cancellation earphones that are super convenient. Oh wow, by comparison these just seem like I don't even have noise cancellation on. The difference is way more-er than I thought when I hadn't side-by-sided them yet. Man, I don't know if I can go back. The case is kinda thicker, though, which is a pain in the butt. And they're not cheap, they're almost 300 US dollars. Type C charging, though, means I no longer have to have lightning cables in my life. But then, I rarely use lightning anyway. Do they have wireless charging? They do have wireless charging. Okay. They're just not really that comparable, to be honest with you. But there's more to earphones than sound quality, and what Apple does really well is ergonomics. These are so comfortable, and something that I do that probably most people don't is I sleep with earphones in every night. They are, they're not as comfortable. The tighter seal against the ear, the fact that they're so bulky... So you can see, the size difference is marked. All right, let's try the other thing. So apparently they've really tuned it to deal with wind noise. Select this if wind noise is bothersome. Using this function shortens continuous playback time. So I guess I'm not supposed to be able to hear that fan. Oh yeah. Oh wow, it works really well. So I'm getting that exact same effect, the (vocalizes), kinda sounds like someone flapping a flag in the wind or something as the wind passes over the mic. Oh, that's really cool. So the noise cancellation is what takes away the actual whirring, but then the wind noise reduction is what takes away the (vocalizes) sound of the wind blowing over the mic. That works surprisingly well. I really like these. I'm impressed. I think I'm gonna try and make the switch, 'cause they really do sound a lot better. So grab the short circuit. The case pin also is not as ... it's all right. This is so satisfying as a fidget toy. This is like, yeah, it's all right. That's a very minor gripe, obviously.",sony xm4 earbuds,"Sony's WF-1000XM4s have a new integrated V1 processor, which is supposed to give them much better active noise cancellation.They also have a comparably-sized battery case compared to the AirPods Pros.The advantage of these is they provide an excellent seal against the ear canal with very little noise bleed, but the disadvantage is that they are not the best in terms.

2,fMw1h4hKT_E,Sony WF-1000XM4 review: silence to my ears,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMw1h4hKT_E,The Verge, so it's been almost two years since sony released the excellent wf-1000x m3 earbuds which had the best noise cancellation and sound quality of any true wireless earbuds at that time but a lot has happened since at the top end we've seen products like the airpods pro and bose's quiet comfort earbuds and you can get a perfectly fine set of noise canceling earbuds for cheaper than ever before but now sony's back and let me tell you it was worth the wait the new wf-1000xm4 earbuds we've still got these terrible names cost 279 dollars which is a lot of money but if you're willing to part with it you'll get the most impressive noise cancellation i've ever heard in earbuds like these even better sound quality longer battery life i know this time they finally got water and sweat resistance [Music] so the new ear buds are 10 percent smaller than the 1000x m3s and they come in the usual sony colors of black with rose gold accents or a light gray option instead but the case is where the real downsizing has happened it's 40 smaller than before and you can feel that difference when it's inside your pocket there's only one led on the outside now though which means there are no lights on the earbuds themselves to tell you how their charges but i guess that's the trade-off for a more compact design but i actually want to start off with the ear tips this isn't something we often focus on but sony's come up with these stellar tips that feel like a mix of silicone and foam that sealed into my ears just perfectly i guess that's why they're called the noise isolation ear tips sony is so confident in them that these new tips are now all you get and only in three sizes i'd have liked to have seen more fit options for this much money but the large pair were right on for me the thousand xm4s never so much as budged even when i took them on runs or for a hike outside and since they're now rated ipx4 for water and sweat resistance you can work out while you wear them or wear them in the rain and be confident that they'll survive just be careful to keep the case dry [Music] those snug ear tips combined with sony's new v1 processor lead to the best noise cancellation i've ever experienced with true wireless earbuds so far step aside bows i'm not exaggerating when i say that it's now almost as good as sony's over ear 1000xm4 headphones and those have the advantage of literally covering your entire ears working outside my local coffee shop on a busy brooklyn street everything around me just went poof and the clatter of subway cars was quieter with these in my ears than with the airpods or bose's earbuds becca took the sony's on a flight and they passed plane tests with flying colors it's wildly good stuff and a real technical achievement on sony's part there's an ambient sound mode you can activate with the tap of the left earbud to hear what's happening around you and sony still has its old trick where you can hold down on the earbuds to temporarily lower the volume of your music and boost ambient sound at the same time the thousand xm4s also get the speak to chat feature of the latest sony headphones when this setting is turned on the earbuds automatically pause and activate transparency mode if they detect you speaking if you talk to yourself even semi-regularly you should probably just leave this off now let's talk sound quality [Music] sony tells me that it tunes its earbuds and headphones based on what genres of music are popular at the time and so while the thousand xm4 is sounding mostly similar to the thousand xm3s there's this added layer of richer bass than there was before you still get that superb sound signature that's just plain better than the airpods pro and i prefer sony's tuning to other high-end earbuds like the sennheiser momentum true wireless 2s it's easy just to get lost in your tunes with these earbuds for the first time on its earbuds sony's also now supporting ldac so you can stream lossless audio from amazon music hd and soon spotify and apple music and it'll come through at a higher quality on the buds it's not quite cd quality you see ldac tops out around 900 kilobits per second and gets a little unstable if you set it at that maximum quality so i usually stick with the middle setting is there any real difference though maybe i'm buying into snake oil but to me these lossless tracks do feel like they've got more depth and clarity to them either way you can only get ldac on android and 1000xm4 still sound just as good when you listen to aac files on an iphone and then there's the battery life which is one of the more impressive things sony's pulled off the thousand xm4 buds get eight hours of playback with noise cancelling on which crushes apple and bows and jabra on amazon samsung and well pretty much everybody else they all hover around five hours and sony just tacked on three more that's progress battery life extends to 12 hours if you don't need noise cancelling on the case has enough juice for two full recharges so we're talking 24 hours in noise cancelling mode and 36 hours if you leave it disabled as we all start traveling again more often these numbers really set sony apart and help justify that 279 dollar price and the carrying case charges both wirelessly and over usbc as for voice calls the thousand xm4s use both beamforming mics and bone conduction sensors that sony claims help the earbuds know when you're speaking and when you're not to hear how that comes across in practice let's turn it over to becca rolling rolling rolling did someone say mike test first up we had the galaxy buds pro they were 200 when they were released and they were known for their windshield technology so you could have clear calls even in windy conditions okay next up is the airpods pro they have been the gold standard for a very long time when it comes to mic quality and quite frankly i'm getting tired of saying that line okay now we have sony's wh 1000 xm4s which i agree with chris is a horrible name but they have bone conduction sensors and beamforming mics how do they sound okay and this one's a bit of a wild card buds these are the soundcore liberty air 2 pros i really dig these headphones and they're only 130 dollars they have really good active noise cancellation so just wanted to throw them into the mix run the sink you all love this test i don't know why i was more fan of the wind test than we did for the galaxy events pro but think test is backed by popular demand the sync test runs the sync while i'm using the mics so that you can see how they sound with a lot of background noise is it canceling it out is it bringing it in see the thing about the water test is that i feel like i'm wasting loads of water and i usually collect it and water my plants with it but i don't need to water any of my plants right now so and that was some background noise did these 130 dollar buds hold up to the other bummer while you could hear me with these sonys it all just seemed kind of muffled and with the sink running it did take out that sound but i wouldn't say they have great mic quality overall you might blame me on the fact that they don't have a stem like the aeropod pros or the soundcore liberty r2 pros but the galaxy buds pro also don't have stems and they have pretty good mics i guess better luck next time so as you just heard these are not flawless earbuds and there are a few other frustrations you should be aware of first they can only pair to one device at a time and look i don't understand how it's 2021 and only jabra has figured out how to support multi-point bluetooth on earbuds sony knows how to make this happen on its headphones but you don't get the same convenience here at 280 dollars that's a hard thing to see sony leave out so i have hit some bugs with my review unit so far the earbuds have crashed a couple times playing the kind of sound you hear when a video game freezes and sometimes only one earbud will pair to my phone at a time so i've got to drop them both back into the case to get everything sorted out again neither is she's been that frequent then sony usually does a pretty good job of fixing these early bugs with firmer updates here's my takeaway sony's wf-1000xm4 earbuds are the best noise canceling set you can get today by combining its latest hardware with those fantastic ear tips sony has beaten bows for the noise cancellation crown and these are up there with the very best sounding true wireless earbuds you can buy they can outlast the competition in battery life and now come with reassuring water and sweat resistance there's no need to spend this much money for a good set of noise cancelling earbuds but if you do you'll get a top-notch experience in exchange sony is back at the top of the mountain the only question now is for how long scary spooky scary you should find a subway great dude over there oh my god i couldn't watch,sony xm4 earbuds,The wf-1000xm4 earbuds cost 279 dollars.They're 10 percent smaller than the 1000x m3s and they come in the usual colors of black with rose gold accents or a light gray option instead.Since they're now rated ipx4 for water and sweat resistance you can work out while you wear them or wear them in the rain and be confident that they'll survive just be careful to keep the case dry.

3,mpOv9h0L9Cc,The Most Advanced Earbuds? Sony WF-1000XM4 Review!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpOv9h0L9Cc,UrAvgConsumer, [Music] what's going on guys it's your average consumer and today we're finally going to be taking a look at the sony wf-1000x m4s yes it's a mouthful as always but these are sony's latest and most advanced earbuds yet but the question is is it worth the 279 dollars that sony's asking for but before we get into these let's actually talk about the unboxing experience so these actually come with some pretty compact packaging once you pop the top you're immediately greeted by the earbuds within their case followed by some packaging with a quick start guide on it with some paperwork inside underneath the paperwork you'll get access to the extra accessories which consist of a short usbc cable as well as some small and large ear tips and of course the earbuds have the medium size on them so you can pick which fits best for you and what's interesting here is that sony seems to have gone with a memory foam ear tip similar to what we've seen with like the compli foam tips which means these should provide a pretty good seal which is important for in-ear buds but when you get to the actual buds within the case i gotta say these feel pretty premium which is what the wf line is all about but let's go ahead and talk about what these actually sound like and how they perform so that's what you get in the box but how is it to actually use these right so first of all let's talk about how these things look sony went with an all-new design over here these are smaller than the previous version the previous version was a little big definitely noticeable when in the ear and while these themselves aren't very tiny once they're inside the ear i feel like it's definitely fine these look too big carl jay so there you have it you guys better than the last ones in terms of overall like comfort when you're throwing them inside of your ears i find them very comfortable once you get them like snug but i always find that whenever i'm trying to put them in i have to do a bit of adjusting so it's not just like a pop them in the ear and go well that that one's fine but i usually find myself having to go like this and then doing a little shimmy here to get it in just right and nice tight seal but overall i think i like what sony did here i feel like these are a good looking pair of truly wireless earbuds they're a little on the thick side but for all the tech that's inside of it you seriously can't complain overall i do think that these are a good looking pair of earbuds and you know once you get them inside of the ear they're pretty secure now the only thing about these is that if you like to lay down with your earbuds some people do some people fall asleep with their earbuds in they're still a bit bulky so you might not be able to do that super comfortably like you can't lay your head on it so something to keep in mind for those of you folks who do it now the color here i have is the black and copper which sony's been doing for a while and it looks really good but they also have i believe like this silver i think they call it silver but it's like a it's not even white jay it's like dark remember the the headphones are like a beige like a dark beige it's kind of like that i'm assuming it's the same color but it's their silver version this case itself is probably a slightly bit bigger than the airpods pro uh but not enough for someone to feel like they can't take these around i could throw these in my pocket oh snap i didn't even put it in this little pocket i could put these in any of my jeans pockets and you know it's not even a thought definitely comfortable to bring around and since we're on the topic of the case this is the charging case so when you store these in here they automatically charge and of course you'll get an extra 16 hours of battery life i believe you get eight hours with active noise canceling from the earbuds themselves and an additional 16 hours once you keep charging them in the case and the case is cool because you got a usb c port in the back but what's even better is the fact that this supports wireless charging so you can just throw it on top of a wireless charger uh you don't lay it on its back or anything just stand it up and boom you'll have wireless charging i think it's great that sony added that functionality in here without making it a gigantic case and you get this cool little led light in the front so that you can know it's charging or if the battery is low you have a solid idea of what's going on with the earbuds and eight hours of battery life with active noise cancelling is really really good i think with the total of 24 hours with active noise canceling on that's kind of like the standard but the earbuds themselves being able to hold eight hours is awesome that's like almost powerbeats pro level and of course you get a lot more battery if you don't use active noise canceling now what makes these the most advanced earbuds that sony has ever come out with well there's a few things and this is like with every 1000x review that we do whether it's the headphones or the earbuds sony has a slew of features and tech built into these things that we can just spend all day talking about but we'll just talk about some of the main things first active noise cancelling on these amazing i've been using the airpods pro for a long time now and i've been using the active noise canceling on those with no issue and these are better these sound better and that's also due to the fact that we've got these new ear tips so there's kind of like a memory foam kind of ear tip here so it'll conform to your ear shape which is nice uh but it also helps to create a better seal so you have a better seal inside of the ear so less sound is coming in so when you have that active noise canceling on you're not getting any like you know extra sounds from the outside that you physically can't stop uh these do a really good job just making sure everything sounds as muted as possible so i'll say it here best active noise canceling earbuds that i've used so far uh they've also got a transparency mode or what sony calls ambient sound mode for apple users that's like the transparency mode on the airpods pro airpods pro are still king in transparency mode simply because it just sounds so natural when the airpods pro in your ear it almost feels like there's nothing there with these because you have that memory foam ear tip it feels like something's in your ear still but i can still hear everyone around me very clearly i think this is sony's best version of their ambient noise feature so you can definitely hold conversations with no problem uh it'll sound pretty natural but after apple i feel like these are probably the second best ambient noise earbuds that are on the market right now they've also got this pretty cool feature called speak to chat which is actually pretty impressive i recently used it while me and jay were in an uber uh i was listening to some music and whenever i needed to say something to jay i'd say something it kicks on the ambient noise mode automatically from hearing my voice it'll pause the music and then you're able to have your conversation and once you're done it'll kick right back on i will say though if you're using the speak to chat feature change the time that it takes to close out the feature from the standard 15 seconds over to the short five seconds because if you have it for 15 seconds after your conversation is done for your music to kick back on you're just kind of sitting there left with your thoughts and you're just like in this weird area where you're just like where's my music but i will say it's a bit of an awkward feature because it doesn't activate based on someone else's voice it only activates based on yours so if someone comes up to you and they start talking you're it's not going to immediately cut off your music is still going to be playing so you'll either have to say wait what'd you say like just something to prompt the feature to turn on or you'll end up having to take out the earbuds themselves so if someone else is initiating the dialogue it's a little bit weird using it but when you are the one initiating dialogue it's just fine now we really start to see how advanced these earbuds are within the companion app there's a section called adaptive sound control and there you've got some pretty surprising features so these are actually able to detect what kind of actions you're taking so if you're walking running and it'll shift the noise canceling or adaptive sound to whatever works best for those situations so if you're outside running it can detect that you're running and you'll probably want to hear your surroundings so it'll automatically switch to the ambient sound mode so that you can hear if like maybe there's a car coming if you're maybe just sitting somewhere you can have like active noise canceling come on it's supposed to intelligently pick the best feature for you what's also kind of cool is that these can detect the locations that you frequent so if you maybe take the train a lot uh it can learn that you take the train and then turn on the active noise canceling whenever you're on in the train station or something you can even go into the app and register certain locations you can use a map to say when i'm here i want this to come on uh when i'm over there i want that to happen so that's just a lot of control that you don't usually expect usually it's just like yo turn on active noise cancelling turn it off that's usually what you get but with these earbuds you get so much more now of course you'll also get touch controls on the side on the right side you can control your audio so you can play pause uh go back a track that kind of stuff answer calls call siri whatever it may be you can call your voice assistant with it as well on the left side is where you get your ambient controls uh so you can turn on active noise canceling ambient sound whatever it is you have access to those controls over here and you can go within the app and customize uh which side does what as well and just like with the larger headphones where you can place your palm on one of the ear cups with these you can leave your finger on like the left earbud and you get a feature called quick attention so that it can you can have a conversation with someone if you don't have like that speech to tap that speak to chat feature on you also get some surprisingly not so standard stuff like being able to automatically pause your audio when you take these out of your ears i really don't know why all true wireless earbuds don't do that if you're a high entry wireless earbud you should be able to automatically pause your music as soon as you take them out of your ears that's just my opinion and what's also nice is that even if you don't put these in the case right away after using them if you keep them out of the case for a while they'll automatically shut off so you don't have to worry about battery life dying even when these aren't in your ears or in the case now a cool feature that sony has with these is the easy pairing with android so now if you have an android device and you just bought these all you have to do is basically open up the case have it near your device it'll automatically detect it and ask to pair so that's kind of like that airpods experience that we're used to but now with you know an updated android phone you'll have access to that feature as well but yes there are a ton of features that you can check out for yourselves if you're interested i just wanted to let you guys know some of the best ones and some of the you know craziest things that this thing can do but sony's done it again they brought all the features over from their big flagship headphones down to the earbuds and they did it really really well now how do these sound i personally think they sound good of course it's sony it sounds great you guys what did you expect i feel like these have a lot of life to them if you're looking for a bit of bass please have it you can go into the app and add even more bass if you want uh but it sounds really nice and like punchy without it being overdone that is like the balance you always want where you were able to you know hear the thump in your music a bit without having your vocals suffer honestly these are probably going to be my go-to earbuds i feel like i just changed them jay from the beats the b studio buds and now i'm changing it to these because these are that good uh so i enjoy listening to these they're great for watching like regular content as well so he did a really good job with the audio here i honestly have no complaints um the only thing that might be a tough pill to swallow is the fact that these are on the expensive side these are 279.99 which is at the true upper end for truly wireless earbuds at least the most mainstream ones so you are paying a premium but you are getting a very premium product but what do you guys think i know a lot of people are very happy with the wh 1000x mark force sony's flagship headphones but the earbuds are definitely worth giving a shot if you want something a bit more low-key but you still want access to all of those cool features and good sound quality but that about wraps up for this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy girl that gives this video a thumbs up and uh let me know in the comments do you think these are worth the 279 bucks i think so but i'm curious about your thoughts till next video guys it's your average consumer peace carl you need to upgrade can i go huh huh i can't hear you no canceling is too good,sony xm4 earbuds,The wf-1000x m4s come with some pretty compact packaging.The earbuds are a little on the thick side but for all the tech that's inside of it you seriously can't complain.The case is cool but not enough for someone to take these in their pocket. The Apple earbuds have eight hours of battery life with active noise canceling on that's kind of like the standard.There's kind of like a memory foam kind of ear tip here so it'll conform to your ear shape which is nice but it also helps to create a better seal inside of the ear so less sound is coming in.They've also got this pretty cool feature called speak to chat which is actually pretty cool and impressive. With these earbuds you get so much more now of course you'll also get touch controls on the side on the right side.You also get a feature called quick attention so that it can you can have a conversation with someone if you don't have like that speech to tap that speak to chat feature on you.You can also turn on the active noise canceling whenever you're on in the train station or something you can even go into the app and register certain locations.
4,Rknl4uIOyfY,Sony WF-1000XM4 true wireless earbuds full review,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rknl4uIOyfY,GSMArena Official, hey what's up guys will here for gsm arena we have something a little different to show you today a pair of earbuds these are sony's new wf-1000x m4 wireless earbuds and if you're into this sort of thing these are kind of a big deal so let's see what makes them special [Music] sony made waves when they released the previous model the wf-1000xm3 these were wireless earbuds that provided active noise cancellation something that you typically would expect from larger over-ear headphones and they did it so well that it pretty much set the bar for the industry now over a year later we have the upgrade the wf-1000x m4 sony has basically rebuilt the headphones from the ground up starting with a slightly smaller more compact form factor they're smaller than last year but it's worth mentioning that these still aren't tiny and depending on how big your ears are you may start to feel some discomfort after extended use for the sound the headphones feature a new driver unit which brings an improvement in both the power and the frequency response this is thanks to a 20 increase in magnet volume and a more flexible diaphragm overall the sound is just great it's rich balanced and detailed with pronounced mids and powerful lows for wireless earbuds i haven't heard better plus this is the first set of wireless earbuds to support high-res wireless audio through sony's ldac technology and regular audio can also be upscaled to near high res quality to the use of ai behind the magic is a new sony v1 processor it's more powerful so better at correcting for high frequency noise and is more efficient since it integrates both the noise cancelling and bluetooth audio in one chip the active noise cancellation is pretty incredible especially for this form factor sony claims that it's 40 more effective than last year's model and i believe it the foam tips already cut off a lot of the noise but then with a single tap the outside world gets the mute button tapping the left earbud again toggles from noise cancellation to ambient sound where the earbuds pipe in audio from outside so you can keep track of what's going on it sounds pretty natural too for example voices don't seem overly boosted or artificial the wf-1000xm4 provides better voice detection and quality than the previous model thanks to a combination of both a bone conduction sensor and directional microphones that point to your mouth there's one feature that's pretty neat called speak to chat if you say something the earbuds will detect your voice automatically stop your music and switch from voice cancellation to ambient sound all hands free it's more reliable here than on competitors like the galaxy buds pro in the same vein the functions of the headphones can be controlled with your voice and if you speak the wake phrase for a voice assistant they will be ready to help you ok google who are the original members of black sabbath according to britannica black sabbath battery life has improved quite a bit over the previous model you get a couple more hours of use per charge and that's pretty significant if you need to wear them for the whole day of course you charge them like before inside their charging case which itself can be topped up through usbc the new model also supports qi wireless charging if you find that more convenient and connectivity has been improved now it's even easier to pair with bluetooth to your android device or even your windows 10 pc so there you have it the sony wf-1000xm4 earbuds seem like a clear upgrade over the previous model which already set a standard for noise cancellation of course they bring the typical drawbacks of earbuds as far as comfort goes but in pretty much every other respect these can hold up surprisingly well against full-sized over-ear wireless headphones and are worth recommending thanks for watching guys stay safe and see you on the next one [Music],sony xm4 earbuds,The wf-1000xm4 provides better voice detection and quality than the previous model thanks to a combination of both a bone conduction sensor and directional microphones.The battery life has improved quite a bit over the previous model you get a couple more hours of use per charge.This is the first set of wireless earbuds to support high-res wireless audio.
5,Hxz_r0vAPoo,Worth buying Sony WF-1000XM4 in 2023? 🤔,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxz_r0vAPoo,Aaron X Loud and Wireless, [Music] hey guys so is the Sony wfos xm4 still worth buying in 2023. it used to be that I wholeheartedly recommend this product but now I've got mixed feelings about it and in this video I'm gonna break it down into three reasons why you shouldn't buy it and three reasons why you should buy it right now since I've been using it for almost two years and I've covered pretty much all of its firmware Updates this is kind of like a long-term review of this product so I hope that this video will bring you value for your time I've split this video into chapters to make it easier to navigate and if you want to see more earbuds and Tech related videos from this channel get subscribed and tap the Bell button to stay notified okay first let's talk about why you shouldn't buy the Sony WF thousand xm4 reason number one call Quality in less noisy conditions it actually is quite decent in terms of voice pickup like when I was testing it in a public place in this video link in the description but in much noisier conditions you get a lot of noise leakage into the vocals which makes it sound terrible to the person on the call with you if it's call Quality you're looking for I recommend that you go for the Sony link belts as instead it does a much better job at cleaning up that noise in the vocals reason number two metallic pinging sound when chewing I suspect that it's gonna do with the bone conduction sensor because even the link buds s has this hollow picking sound now some people might find this issue annoying but to be honest it's not really annoying enough for me to be a deal breaker in my previous video about this issue again Link in the description there are also many people in the comments who don't think that this metallic pinging sound is a problem at all to be honest I just included it on this list because some people actually returned the Thousand xm4 because of this number three the battery life glitch now I want to emphasize that this seems to only affect the older units so if you were to get fresh stock in 2023 it's quite unlikely that you'll encounter this issue basically what happens to older units including mine is this glitch that under reports the actual remaining battery life causing the units to only last about an hour or even less than that it seems to be an issue that software updates can't fix so the units do have to be replaced by Sony and I'm glad that Sony's customer service seems to be pretty solid as an many people have gotten their units replaced with no issues now even when their units are out of warranty as was mine so this one here is actually a replacement unit now if you're looking to buy one in 2023 I suggest that you do avoid buying them used or refurbished try to get the fresh stock as much as possible because these don't seem to have this issue anymore if you want to learn more about this issue I've created a whole series about this with of course the links in the description now let's talk about why you should buy the wfos xm4 this year despite everything I've said above number one it's active noise canceling even after a few years these are still one of the most powerful noise cancellers in the market while being small and compact granted there are others that right now are more powerful noise cancellers like the Bose qc2 earbuds the dvla Gemini but those also tend to be bigger or more expensive or both so the wftxm4 strikes a good balance on size while not compromising on ANC performance number two it's gonna snug fit that doesn't fall out maybe even more snug because of the foam tips and if you watched some of my previous videos I keep emphasizing time and again that fit alone can make or break through wireless earbuds if it's meant to be noise isolating it has to be snug and stay snug otherwise the sound quality is affected as well as its noise canceling this one never falls out ever of course you'll have to try different sizes of ear tips to find the right fit for your ears and the foam tips do have to be replaced once in a while due to hygiene reasons but if it's a snug solid fit that you're after this is great and number three of why you should buy it if you're looking to get some great sounding earbuds the xm4's sound quality is still among the best right now it does support high-res wireless streaming over ldac so if you've got an expensive dap this one's very suitable for that it also has tight bass without sounding over bloated clean and Rich mids and Airy highs and it's also possible to further fine tune it in the Sony headphones collect app of course this may not be to everyone's liking I want to emphasize that its sound quality is not for everyone some people may feel it's got too much bass others may feel that it's too bright in the midst but for me it strikes the right balance and sounds great for various types of music that I listen to namely Lo-Fi hip-hop synthwave classical instrumental and Game soundtrack Tracks Of course RMB once in a while so those are three reasons to get and not to get the wrxm4 in 2023 after weighing the pros and cons and considering that this is an older model I would not go for these unless it's on promo especially now that we've got the Sony link bus s yes it doesn't have wireless charging it is total battery isn't as great as the xm4s but it's very close to the xm4s in terms of performance and sound and it's much more tiny has better call Quality much better in fact and a lot more affordable than the xm4 it does use silicone tips instead of foam so it's got less noise blocking in the mid-range than the xm4s but you can also get foam tips to go with them again if you're interested I've got the links in the description below and just a while ago there was a firmware update that added multi-point pairing to the link belts s which makes the link belts as even better value for money right now well the xm4 might also be getting multi-point pairing but that update according to Sony was supposed to happen in the winter and then spring is almost here to be honest I'm not sure if Sony is still making it happen at all but just in case the xm4 does get multi-point pairing in a future firmware update I will come back to you with another video about it so do subscribe and tap the Bell button to stay notified about that update thanks for watching smash like and share it helps a lot I'm also on this quad so if you have this quad come and join the chat link is in the description click here to find out which are the best earbuds I've tested in the past year I've also made a video about my dream desk setup of 2023 so if you're interested in that kind of content watch this video over here,sony xm4 earbuds,The Sony WF thousand xm4 earbuds are still worth buying in 2023.This video breaks it down into three reasons why you shouldn't buy it and three reasons why you should buy it right now.The battery life glitch seems to only affect the older units so if you were to get fresh stock in 2023 it's quite unlikely that you'll encounter this issue. On size while not compromising on ANC performance number two it's gonna snug fit that doesn't fall out maybe even more snug because of the foam tips.The xm4's sound quality is still among the best right now it does support high-res wireless streaming over ldac.It's much more tiny has better call Quality much better in fact and a lot more affordable than the xm4 it does use silicone tips instead of foam.
6,QC7IRar8Ytw,Almost Ideal Premium TWS | Sony WF 1000XM4 Review,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC7IRar8Ytw,Geekyranjit, [Music] hi guys this is ranjit and in this video we'll be doing the full in-depth review for this premium tws from sony that are known as the wf-1000xm4 and i feel if you are looking for a premium what do you say tws this might be the ideal tws for a lot of you but personally for me this was not the perfect tws because this was one major flaw that i found with this one uh so we'll cover all the aspects of this one in this in-depth review and guys if you know i'm used to premium tws this is the airpods pro this is the jabra light seven this is the pixel bars etc so i'm used to them so let's get on with the review and guys if you see the packaging is very weird it comes in this sort of a box so you have to tear this to open and here we have a recycled uh case uh and here you have some paperwork and all these things and here you have some extra ear tips exactly too that we get in this one so a little bit different type of packaging that you're getting uh these are the actual tws that we get let me just zoom in to give you an idea and uh they look good guys and we'll go over all these aspects one by one so that we cover all the points so let's talk about the build quality and looks and here i would say the build quality like any premium tws is good uh this is made up of plastic guys but good quality plastic and you have that good feel when you close it and open it and you have one led led over here uh green means it's completely charged in the earlier what do you say xm3s which i reviewed about year and a half ago uh they also had a led light over the buds but this one we do not have that uh definitely in terms of size of the earbuds these are slightly uh bigger but again unlike the xm3s which chatted out quite a bit out these one actually don't come out that much but certainly these buds are bigger in size compared to many of the birds for example this is the jabra tws as you can see how small it looks so certainly it's slightly on the bigger side i have to say okay next thing is regarding the bluetooth range and did i find any connectivity problems on this one and i tested this with multiple smartphones guys and i have to say i did not have any problems with the bluetooth range on this one this is typical bluetooth range that you should expect with tws in the same room i never had any problem even in the next room then when i went out and even the door was closed of this one then also it didn't really so the typical bluetooth range that you expect it's like that i did not have in fact any connectivity issues with this one so that way i don't have a problem but again guys uh one thing to note is that these are premium uh parts again it's available on amazon as of now it's at about 20 000 i'll leave the links guys so that you can check it out but again this simultaneously cannot connect to two different smartphones so that multi connect is not there on this one uh for example the headphone the bigger brother of this one the headphones the xm4 headphones can connect simon's simultaneously to two different devices this cannot do that but connectivity no issues now how about lag while watching videos and stuff because you know many of the modern smartphones simply do not have a headphone jack so you have to use this and here i would say i was happy i watched quite a bit of youtube videos and i did not get that lip sync issue i even watched what do you say a little bit of netflix for about 20-25 minutes and that also i did not have any lip sync issues on this one so that is not that but again if you're trying to do gaming and stuff if you're very picky about it you will notice it again that's the case with even most of the other tws okay now let's talk about apps and button customization uh first let's talk about the physical aspect of this again we have this right and the left earbud and this area what we have is actually touch sensitive guys so when you wear this from the right hand side you can control what you say the music for example if you just tap it once it'll pause double tap to the next track triple trap go to the previous track standard stuff that you get like that on the left hand side uh you can actually customize this but by default it is set to active noise cancellation or active noise cancellation off and uh switching off you have the third option also so i'm using that you can actually if you don't want that you can change it to volume controls but again you have to select within so the controls are okay on this one but i felt again as this is a touch sensitive area uh it works about ninety percent of the time sometimes ten percent of the time i do have that missing thing another one feature that i like with this earphones and if you have used many of the high-end sony headphones also for example let's say you're just wearing it somebody comes to you you can just tap this left around area and it enables the hear through so that you can speak to that person without removing this because these provide a very good seal so even if you keep the active noise cancellation off uh you are not able to hear the people so you have that here to feature also on this one now moving to the app again if you have okay let me just open this so that it is connected and let me show you the app and in fact you can also use it with just a single one also you don't need to actually use both the but sometimes for taking because i was just using a single one so you can do that just keep one over here and let me just open uh this app it's the sony headphone app and guys here as you can see it gives you an idea first about the battery starts on uh what do you say the birds everything like this and this is inside that so it's not showing let me just take and it fell down okay so again as you can see hundred percent and these will be almost all the time hundred percent charged guys because like any other tws whenever you're not listening you'll have to put back in the case uh but generally the battery life is really good on this these are rated for about eight hours but i simply could not test it fully i'll talk about that uh later on but again as you can see this is what we have and in status uh it gives you an idea and sound you have a lot of features that speak to chat also is there so automatically when you start speaking it enables what you say uh year through features but again if you're a person who likes to sync then don't use this because it gets activated all the time uh good thing is that we also have a lot of equalizer options on this one as you can see like this so you have quite a few and in fact you can also have your own custom ones i'm actually uh set it to manual and if you notice i have just boosted the treble tones a little bit and you can also adjust the clear bass from here if you go to this and hit this customize option you can actually customize it so again in terms of sound uh and stuff the customization that it has it has a lot of options uh again i did not have any issues with bluetooth connectivity i was keeping on priority sound the good thing is that if you are using an android smartphone it can use the higher codec that is ldac if i recall i have enabled it for using ldac it works only on android phones so not on as you can see ldac ldac is supported on android phones higher end android phones but not on iphones i iphones that uses the standard a ac codec so that option is there on this one uh and you also have this dscc extreme option uh so here are the system stuff again you can change the touch features as i've told you you can change what you want a little bit so a little bit of customization is also editing is not temporary okay i'm going to exit so it gives you an idea and you can update also the the what you say and in fact i already updated this one i've been using this now for about seven eight days now this one so that's the app uh in terms of app i would say uh it's pretty feature rich app uh so i don't have a problem with the app okay now let's talk about the most important thing that is about comfort and here i would say i was not that happy with this one if you notice let me actually show you the extra ear tips and in fact guys i played around with this one for three four days trying to get the right fit and as you can see we have this large small and medium is already fitted and these are not regular what do you say uh your tips these are kind of that foam based and to even wear it you have to just squeeze it completely and then put in your ear and it expands a little bit but personally for me uh these ear tips are simply not that great i tried all the large one the medium that came in default the small ones and after about 20-25 minutes it starts giving me a little bit of ache in my ear so definitely i would say uh the ear tips are not that great at least for my years it might be okay for your ears but guys i've used the airpods pro i don't have any problems with the ear tips on this one this jabra elite seven i don't have any issues even the pixel parts uh i don't have a shoe but but this one after 20 25 minutes even though i have tried all the tips on this one it gives me a little bit of what do you say ear pain after 20-25 minutes and that's the reason i simply could not test the battery life because after just using it you have to put it back and it just starts charging it's supposed to give about eight hours of battery life so i feel here sony cheaped out a little bit because with xm3s in fact here we only to get two extra pairs of ear tips there actually we got six pairs of ear tips so with the xm3s we had a lot more ear tips on that and i could get a comfortable fit and i could listen to music for hours and hours without any issues but on this one just your tips and it's just not me guys i've even seen some of the reviews for example c net editors also had an issue with the ear tips and they said that they used the ear tips that came with the xm3s and it was fine but i don't have the xm3s to test it so again this can be a little bit of a hit or miss i would say the earth tips i i have normal years with other twss that have idea i don't have any problem the default mediums are fine enough this one even the small one which i have tested it was simply not comfortable for me after uh 25 30 minutes that's the reason i though i loved it i'll talk about the sound but i simply could not wear it for a very long time it's just after some time this is not comfortable sony should have given us uh considering the price point more variety of ear tips like they did with the xm3s in my frank opinion okay now let's talk about the active noise cancellation and here i have to say this one is among the best ews even better than the active noise cancellation that we get on the airports pro so among the tws's i've tested and i have a lot of premium twss apart and i'm just listing some of them over here uh this has to be the best active noise cancellation on a tws period so that gets a 10 out of 10 for me it's even more powerful than the earpods pro so active noise cancellation they have done a brilliant job and in fact because of this memory foam ear tips also you press them and put it inside the seal is so good that even if you are not using active noise cancellation it isolates you quite a bit but when you switch it on the active noise cancellation it's like a vacuum that is created it's almost as good as the uh what do you say headphones the big size headphones that is the sony wh xm4 headphones active noise cancellation it's that good so in tws definitely if active noise cancellation is a criteria these are the best as of now guys period okay now let's talk about the microphone quality and i know this is a topic of discussion because if you see my review of the xmr threes also the last generation of this one a tws overall i loved it but the microphone quality was simply not that good and whenever i was taking calls uh wearing that other other people used to complain that my call quality was not clear luckily on this one i would say it's actually improved by leaps and bound so most of the time other people do not complain about the call quality when i'm using this one as the microphone uh but again i would still say these are not the best the best what do you say microphones again would go to the airports pro or if you want multi-connectivity with android and stuff then this is the jabra lights these have far better what do you say uh microphone but for most people this will do the job but again these are not the best guys in terms of microphone i would rate the microphone quality to be about eight out of ten and this is a big improvement from the xm3s the last generation that were bad really if i have to rate it i would have rated that one four out of ten this is about 8 out of 10. so that's regarding the microphone improve but not among the best now about the volume adjustment directly from this one this as i've told you is sort of a hit or a miss and they should have done something what the jabra is doing here with the jabras if you've seen my review of this one you can even control the tracks a and c have everything and even the volume directly from this one here directly controlling the volume is a little bit of a hiss off thing because to do that then you have to disable some of the active noise uh what do you say controls that you're getting on this one uh so yeah so still i would say for controlling the volume i was using the phone okay now regarding the battery life here i would say again these are far far better uh sony claims about eight hours of battery on on this one and i think so it should give about close to seven seven and a half hours uh so battery life is excellent in fact far better than the airports pro almost closely almost almost not exactly but almost double the battery life that i get on the eight part one certainly my airports are slightly older now uh so battery life is not an issue on this one and when you put back in the case it just charges and again this also supports wireless charging so if you're a fan of that wireless charging uh you can use wireless charging but this one okay now let's talk about the sound quality and all this thing sound quality for music sound stage and everything the sound stage is actually done very well on this one i do not have a problem uh it gives a very immersive experience i would say so sound is a big strength of this one certainly in terms of if i have to just uh tell you one thing in terms of sound quality just for music listening if i have to rate it these are definitely better than the airpods pro no doubt about that so now let's break it down uh what do i feel about it okay let's talk about the base definitely i would say the base is a little bit boosted on this one which most of you would like but again you also have with the app that extra bass and something i have to take out the extra bass and something like that to connect it i have to just remove this so here if i go to the sound department you can in fact if you go to the manual if i'm going here you can go to here and you can even adjust the amount of excess the extra bass that you want so in terms of bass it's done very well definitely uh out of the box it's slightly uh boosted bass but again uh it is pleasantly done so i enjoyed the bass on this one in fact in bass i would give it as high as about 9.5 out of 10. excellent excellent i would say base much better and tighter base than even this one and next if i talk about the mid-range and the vocals here also sony has done an incredible job and because of that the sound state is good you just really enjoyed the mid-range on this one beautifully done again this i would give almost 10 on 10 on this one the mid-range and the vocals that you're getting on this beautifully done it's not fatiguing or anything now but when we come to the higher tones here i felt in the default mode without any equalization it's slightly lacking uh but you can fix it with the app as i've told you i'm using the custom profile over here let's disconnect it i have to take it out to connect it uh here as you can see and that's why i'm using the manual and i've slightly boosted the treble tones so you have to boost this uh treble stone slightly because the default one it's slightly resist i would say in treble stone so in treble tones i would say it's slightly uh lacking a little bit but you can definitely fix it so here i would give uh what do you say a rating of about uh nine out of ten certainly beautiful and it sounds beautiful guys uh don't get me wrong it's beautiful certainly overall if you look at it just from the music point of view certainly one of the best tws that i have used and i i really enjoyed listening to the music but the only thing is after that 25 30 minutes i had to take it out it was simply not that comfortable uh so okay let's break it down now to how do i rate it personally i would say in comfort for me it was like seven on ten because it was simply not that comfortable features and uh you ease of use it's pretty easy to use i'll give it nine point five to ten i'm just cutting that point of five points because volume edges print is not that easy uh for example the jabra gets a 10 on 10 on that you can do everything from the earbuds itself you don't even have to actually uh go to the app and fill it around inc quality here this is definitely 10 on 10 man this if if you are a person who's specifically getting uh what do you say tws for active noise cancellation as of now these are the best end of the story guys uh next thing is microphone quality certainly has improved but i have to give it eight out of ten and music and sound signature again again 9.25 out of 10. so overall score if i take out the comfort part maybe it's just my years um that these are not comfortable or something like that then i would give this as high rating of 9 out of 10 but personally for me the comfort was an issue that's why for me it is 7.5 out of 10 guys so guys uh this was my in-depth review of this sony uh wf-1000xm4 so what do you guys feel about the same and guys if you're planning to purchase this one i do use my link i'll leave that in the description it does help the channel anyways guys uh that's it for now for this review

wf-1000xm4 premium headphones.Review includes build quality, packaging, apps, and connectivity.Reviewer: This might be the ideal tws for a lot of you but personally for me this was not the perfect tws. These earphones have a lot of features that speak to chat and voice control.They also have a lot of equalizer options and you can customize them.The battery life on these is rated about eight hours. Airport pro xm4 headphones active noise cancellation is a big improvement from the last generation that were bad really regarding the battery life.This has to be the best active noise cancellation on a tws period.Memory foam ear tips also you press them and it inside the seal is so good that even if you are not using active noise cancellation it isolates you quite a bit.

7,N8LH414Ut-4,Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro Review - 6 Months Later,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8LH414Ut-4,6 Months Later," It's been six months since I bought  a pair of the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2   Pro. While I don't think they're the buds  everyone should get, I'm going to take you   through who I think these buds are for and I'll  answer some of your questions along the way. Now, the first thing I like about these buds  are their sound quality overall. Considering   you can now get these buds for $120  to $170 depending on the retailer,   and I've left purchase links in the description  so you can check whatever their current price is,   considering that they sound very good, especially  when paired with a Samsung Galaxy device. That's   because Samsung uses a proprietary codec called  SSC, which stands for Samsung Scalable Codec,   for encoding and decoding 24-bit audio compared to  the normal 16-bit audio used by other codecs. And   that tech, paired with the drivers found  in these buds, gets you a really nice,   well-balanced sound that at times can be  punchy with a really nice wide soundstage. Now, I got a ton of questions on how these  buds sound compared to the brand new Sony   WF-1000XM5s. I still prefer the XM5s over  the Buds 2 Pro because of their better bass   fit and substantially better battery life, at  eight hours of ANC playback versus the five   hours you get with the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro.  When you compare the Sony's to these buds,   the Sony's help identify two shortcomings  with the Buds 2 Pro sound quality: mainly,   they lack a bit in dynamic  range compared to the Sony's,   and their bass is also a bit lacking. But  that's likely due to their ear tip design. Let me explain: With both the Sony  WF-1000XM5s as well as the LinkBuds S,   which I've also reviewed, Sony uses ear  tips that go further into your ear canal,   creating a better seal, which often  nets you better bass performance. Overall, I'd put the noise cancellation  of the Buds 2 Pro on par with buds like   the LinkBuds S or the Pixel Buds Pro. It's  good, but not best-in-class. Which is a shame,   because I really like the drivers Samsung  put in these buds. If they just had a bit   better sound isolation, I think they'd  be one of the best buds on the market. Now, thankfully, you can somewhat adjust the  EQ of these buds. But the EQ feature that   Samsung implemented for them was not what  I was expecting. Samsung only gives you a   few select options. The dynamic one was the  closest to the adjustments I wanted to make,   but it was still a bit too bass-heavy. I don't  know why Samsung just doesn't let you have a   full EQ like the buds from Sony as well as  the Pixel Buds Pro, which I've also reviewed. Now, related to audio, is another feature  that Samsung marketed with these buds,   and they marketed quite heavily, and that's  called 360 Audio, which can make it sound like   speakers are all around you. And it uses head  tracking technology to make it sound like the   sound coming from your phone is actually coming  from where your phone is physically located. To me, this feature, like it  is on a lot of Apple products,   is mainly a gimmick for earbuds. The  only scenario where I've ever found   this feature actually worthwhile and useful  is when using it with my AirPods Max and   my Apple TV 4K when watching content.  Because in that scenario, the AirPods   Max are actually able to reproduce a surround  sound environment, and it's quite convincing. For these buds, would I buy them over another  brand just for the 360 Audio? No. You could   still get buds like the Pixel Buds Pro or  the new Sony Buds and still benefit from   Dolby Music through services like Apple  Music. Though with earbuds in particular,   I haven't really found much of a benefit  using Dolby Atmos music. Where Dolby Atmos   really makes a difference with music listening,  in my experience, that has been with headphones   like the AirPods Max and with speakers,  specifically the Sonos Ray, a speaker design   signed from the ground up specifically for Atmos  and spatial audio. And I have a long-term review   coming out very soon on it, so make sure you're  subscribed to the channel if you want to see that. But in general, with these buds, Atmos sounds  fine. However, if you enable 360 Audio and   then enable Dolby Atmos on a service like Apple  Music, it actually sounds horrible. I'm assuming   it has to be a bug, but with both settings on,  songs sound echoey and reverberating. It's like   someone took your phone, started playing music on  its speaker, and then chucked it into the world's   largest bathroom. Samsung markets the 360 Audio  feature as being compatible with Dolby Atmos, so   I'm not exactly sure how this got so screwed up.  If you've run into that or know what the hell is   going on, definitely let me know in the comments. Now, the next thing to look at with these buds is   their mic quality. Here's how they sound  compared to some of their competition:  These are the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, this is how their  mics sound. And these are the Pixel Buds Pro,   this is how their mics sound. And these are the  Bose QC IIs, this is how their mics sound. And   these are the Sony WF-1000XM5s. And these  again are the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, these are   how their mics sound. Let me know down in the  comments which one you thought sounded better   when experiencing the transparency mode on these  buds, which I have enabled right now. Overall,   I actually think it sounds pretty decent. I  can hear my environment very well when I use   transparency mode, and when I'm listening to my  voice, it sounds clear. The only knock I'd give   the transparency mode is that when I hear  my voice, it still sounds a bit artificial.   It's almost like someone turned the gain up a  little bit too high on the mics used on the buds,   and it just doesn't sound like I'm not  wearing buds. Which, to be fair to Samsung,   is pretty typical in buds in this price range. Another great thing about these buds is their   design and case. Overall, I found them  to be a pretty comfortable set of buds,   though not as comfortable as the LinkBuds  S. For flights, they've been pretty good.   I used them on a short-haul flight, and the noise  cancellation was pretty good. I haven't used them   on a long-haul flight yet, but I don't actually  think their battery life would really last the   entire flight. Their battery life is only rated  for five hours, which is on the low end when   you look at buds, even buds in this price range.  The Pixel Buds Pro have much better battery life.  While they're comfortable, because the buds  are still kind of wide towards the ear tips,   I could see how it could still make somebody's  ears a bit sore. Also, while I haven't had a   problem with them on walks or hikes, for going  on a run or going to the gym, you might want a   bud design with a stabilizer arc, like those made  by Beats, Bose, and Google, for a more secure fit.  These buds are water resistant. They can  actually be submerged up to 30 minutes with   their water resistance rating, which is  better compared to the higher-priced Sony   WF-1000XM5s. Those only have an IP4X rating,  which means they're just splash resistant.  Another thing I've come to like about these  buds is their case. It's pretty slim, can   hold 18 hours of battery, and I love the grippy  material Samsung used in the design. Plus, it has   wireless charging, as the tech gods intended. And because these buds are made by Samsung,   you do get some Samsung-specific features  with them. Like Samsung SmartThings Find,   which will show you the location and even give  you an audible alarm when you walk away from them   so you don't actually leave them somewhere you  don't want to. They have other features like one   that can sharpen the sound for phone calls when  you're in a noisy environment, auto-switching   between Samsung devices, and a gaming mode  for minimizing audio delay. They also have   a conversation recognition feature that'll lower  the volume when you're talking to someone, which   is pretty nice. But if you sing along to music,  you will likely want to keep that feature off.  For playback controls, they're pretty  straightforward. You just tap once to   play and pause, twice to skip forward, three  times to skip back, and tap and hold the left   button to cycle through transparency mode and  noise cancellation. They have an experimental   feature that you can get to within the bud  settings that does allow you to raise and   lower the volume using the edge of the earbud. So, now let's talk recommendations. Do I recommend   the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro? Yes. Though I don't think  they're the buds for everyone, mainly those who   do not have a Samsung phone. If you don't have  a Samsung phone, I'd personally shop around a   bit and I'd probably only end up on these buds if  they were on a really good sale. I'd spend more   for the Sony WF-1000XM5s if you want better  battery life, noise cancellation, and sound. If you're an Android user, and especially a  Samsung user, and you want a pair of wireless   earbuds with great sound, decent battery  life, in an ergonomic design, and that   has decent noise cancellation, I think these are  definitely a buy. I've left purchase links in the   description so you can check their current price  or the price of the other buds that I mentioned. If you like this video and found it helpful,  consider giving it a thumbs up. That really helps   out the channel.

8,vluEm6XJWjs,NEW GALAXY BUDS 2 PRO - Samsung&#39;s disruptive earbuds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vluEm6XJWjs,Mike O'Brien, all right the galaxy buds 2 pro wow these earbuds there's so much to talk about these there's a lot of great features on here great fit way better than in my opinion the galaxy buds 2 and better than the galaxy buds pro and for a while we didn't know if these were going to be the sequel to the buds 2 or the buds pro and with the name of the buds 2 pro it was still a little confusing right but after actually using them it doesn't matter which one they're the sequel to i would say they're probably the sequel to the pro but either way they're substantially better than either one of those there's so many cool features on here fantastic sound quality great active noise cancellation great microphones and a lot more we're going to talk about in this video not everything's perfect we're going to talk about the cons as well but i want to start off with my favorite category with a pair of earbuds like these and this is going to be the features and the controls something that samsung always excels with so much so getting into the features that these have there's really a massive array of features but starting off we can easily switch between galaxy devices like the galaxy watch or more recently a tv as well and so this is really useful if you're obviously in the samsung ecosystem so for example using a samsung phone i'm gonna go for a run leave my phone at home i can instantly switch over to my galaxy watch additionally we have voice detect on here another feature we've seen previously from samsung when you're playing music you can just start talking if somebody walks over to your desk it'll turn your music down pause it turn on ambient and you can talk to whoever you're talking to and then when you're done talking after like 10 seconds the music will resume you can control if single double triple tap is enabled and this is kind of new to enable each individual one so if you say you know what i hate single tap let's just do double and triple you can enable those and for tap and hold then not only can you enable or disable that you can also choose exactly what that does from volume controls which i don't use and i'll show you why in a second or you could do like spotify or or assistant or something like that and speaking of assistance we have bixby wake up on here if you're into that of course there's an equalizer the ability to read your notifications just in general or read by specific apps that you enable we've got ambient sound that works during calls if you want it which i personally use i like talking on the phone and hearing myself talk so i'm not yelling and also so it's not like a weird environment for me but you can turn this off if you want to not hear yourself talk when you're on the phone we have in-ear detection for calls again meaning that if you're on a phone call and you take the earbuds out it'll switch over to speakerphone very easy to do that and not have to answer a call and say oh it's connected to my earbuds i don't know where my earbuds are and then you're like trying to switch you know on your phone next we have a really interesting and new one this is not one i've seen on any pair of earbuds in the past and it's using the accelerometers on the earbuds to actually determine when your neck is looking down too much so if you're looking at your phone for more than 10 minutes you'll get an alert a little notification on your phone that you should look up and stretch your neck and it's supposed to be good for your posture in general it's something that i've actually already experienced you don't realize how long you're looking down at your phone but even just doing my sound quality test which i've been using these for a while but when i was making this video i was just going through songs and trying to figure out what was good and what was not good about these earbuds and i was looking down the whole time and then after it seemed like a minute it was actually 10 minutes it notified me that i was looking down for too long we also have uh in samsung labs in there you can actually go into gaming mode and what i was saying about the the controls earlier the reason i don't use the touch and hold for volume is because you can double tap the earbud edge to control the volume a great feature that i really love to see on samsung earbuds it's been around for a couple years now i'm not sure why it's still in samsung labs i think it's a great feature and i really wish they would kind of just streamline that in with the rest the controls but regardless great feature to have and of course if you lose the earbuds you can do more than just have them chirp with samsung smartthings find you can go in there and see where they were last connected to your phone and things like that these earbuds are definitely impressive but we need to compare them to the best on the market so if you want go on down and leave a comment and let me know what you want me to compare these two i think my next video is probably going to be comparing these to the pixel buds pro leave a comment let me know you think about that and while you're down there definitely click that subscribe button so you don't miss that video so like i said a massive set of features and honestly even more when you dig into accessibility but now let's talk about another very impressive aspect of these earbuds being the sound quality so the sound quality in these overall is really good in my opinion with a fantastic balance warm and powerful bass and then sub bass being rumbly and clearly very capable around 30 to 40 hertz you're really getting a lot of punch out of that and then the bass drums are clean and powerful you're getting a natural full sound with with like i said great balance and a fun signature that presents vocals well also while delivering detailed highs and a clean strong beat in the lows instrument separation and low level detail are definitely good on these not quite industry leading like they're not quite sennheiser and banging a luftsan level but they're still better than a lot of previous samsung earbuds which is the same they're a very close second they're really really good as far as sound quality goes i would say that these have a good weight and a pretty good head stage as well but as i was alluding to with the low level detail they could use like a tad more depth and that would put them at the number one like best sounding earbuds that's really the only thing holding them back as far as getting into actual songs i've listened to slow ready by goose on their newer album has great dynamics and pleasant vocals and then if you listen to downhill by drake this is a great example of the balance where there are a lot of different very very different frequencies that on other earbuds might eclipse each other and that did not happen with these earbuds listening to the snaps earlier on this song they're not sibilant as they might be with a lot of other earbuds and the whole song really comes together like i said without eclipsing any other frequency bands okay so that's a lot about what these earbuds do but i didn't actually talk that much about the case or the design in general so the case of these earbuds is really familiar as you guys might recognize this kind of square design on the front personally i'm a big fan of that i like it when you can open up the earbuds they can sit open on a desk like that wireless charging on the bottom type c on the back really a great case design and why change something that already works well the case inside has two you know obviously the two little earbuds one kind of tiny gripe with this is that they look like they would go in like vertical but they kind of rotate a lot more than you think the earbuds almost go in like sideways and so this means that when you put it in like it usually slides over where it should be but i've had a couple instances where i put them in and they didn't quite settle down where they were supposed to but once you get used to it absolutely no complaints with the case design the earbuds themselves look really similar to the previous generation specifically the galaxy buds pro however these are 15 smaller than the pros when you're wearing them you can absolutely tell that there are three different colors there's a purple which i have right here we've got the black and of course a white one as well i actually really like all these a lot because they are matte and one of my biggest complaints about the pros besides like you know anything functional just from the aesthetic point was the mirror finish i really didn't like how the pros looked and so having a matte finish like this looks great just a subtle earbud that is very compact very small and you can leave a comment let me know how you think these look personally i'm a big fan of the aesthetics here but they also have ipx7 water resistant so if you're working out they fit really well we'll talk more about fit in a second but the water resistance means that sweating or dropping them in a puddle or whatever anything that happens with water these are probably going to be okay the case unfortunately does kind of get scuffed a little bit easily it's not really that bad because from every kind of small damage i've done to it so far you can kind of rub it off and and it comes back to looking normal but it does scuff a little bit easy something to be aware of like i said with fit and comfort they are very secure which again i didn't expect this i always loved the wingtips on the galaxy buds plus and the regular galaxy buds as well and samsung moving away from that was always a little disappointing the buds live never fit in my ears very well the buds too would fall out all the time specifically of my left ear and the buds pro stayed in reasonably well but still weren't really that great for me and they were kind of hit or miss a lot of people really didn't like them and so again no wing tip so take this with a grain of salt everybody has different ear geometry but for me personally these stay in substantially better than i thought i went for a four mile run the other day like a pretty fast run at that and it was really hot out and the earbuds i never once had to even adjust them they stayed in perfectly the entire time incredibly light my ears didn't feel stuffy i was just really happy with the fit and the comfort of these earbuds diving into the active noise cancellation they're calling this intelligent anc on here and basically when you're using it what is it actually like so i would say it's definitely very clean so you don't have a lot of white noise or hissing or anything like that and it's actually substantially more powerful than i expected so you're able to block out a lot of sounds around you very very capable of blocking low frequencies very well and keep in mind this only comes with silicone ear tips so if you swap these out for some foam tips i'm sure you could block out higher frequencies as well and really have a very impressive pair there now let's actually get into a microphone test all right so i'm outside right now by a pretty busy road it's also really breezy and there's a box truck right there so tons of sound leave a comment and let me know how these are performing and now for reference this is what they sound like indoors in a much quieter environment so getting into some of the pros with these earbuds like i said the active noise cancellation is actually really really good the sound quality is really good the fit and comfort is really good i love the design the aesthetics they check a lot of boxes and on top of that they're coming with a future proof bluetooth 5.3 and then additionally without active noise cancellation you can get up to 29 hours of battery when you're including the case but not everything is good with these like i said we can get scuffed on these a little bit uh the transparency mode is decent enough and i'd give this like a maybe like a b minus rating but i can still hear everything around me but it doesn't sound like very natural sounds a little bit muffled additionally although these have great sound and they have samsung's scalable codec if you're using samsung phones you're getting 24 bit audio if you're not using samsung phones there's no higher level codecs you're limited to just sbc and aac they don't have aptx so if you don't have a samsung phone you're kind of out of luck with this in addition to that if you have an iphone you can technically connect these but you're not going to be able to get any of the settings we showed you in this video because there is no available app for iphones again samsung just trying to play apple's game there unfortunately although you get a great battery life when anc is off if you turn on active noise cancellation which let's be honest you're probably going to do this you only get five hours in the earbuds and 18 hours with the case and then my biggest complaint with these is although they're able to switch between samsung devices what if you don't have a samsung device right like what if you're using a windows laptop and you're using a galaxy phone or even a macbook and a galaxy phone in that situation there is no multi-point connection that's a big problem for me because i do use a macbook and i want to use samsung devices and switching between them would just be so nice and it's something other earbuds already do samsung needs to add that feature so in conclusion here before i was really unsure if these were going to be a sequel to the galaxy buds pro or the galaxy buds 2. and as it turns out they're kind of a sequel to both they're better than the pros they're better than twos and these in my opinion are easily the best earbuds samsung ever made the matte finish the cool new features the improved sound quality make these a clear upgrade over the previous generations of samsung earbuds while simultaneously checking almost all the boxes for earbuds in my opinion from top notch water resistance to bluetooth 5.3 solid microphones the only really downsides here are the battery and the lack of multi-point connectivity and honestly i would say these probably have a really good chance at being the best overall earbuds of 2022. too early to tell but leave a comment let me know what you think about the galaxy buns 2 pro i personally really enjoy these if you enjoyed the video consider liking and subscribing i'm mike o'brien thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music] you,Galaxy Buds2 Pro,The galaxy buds 2 pro are the sequel to the galaxy buds 2 pro.They have a lot of great features but also a lot of cons. The sound quality in these overall is really good in my opinion with a fantastic balance warm and powerful bass and then sub bass being rumbly and clearly very capable around 30 to 40 hertz.The case of these earbuds is really familiar as you guys might recognize this kind of square design on the front.One of my biggest complaints about the pros besides like you know anything functional just from the aesthetic point was the matte finish. The Galaxy 2 pro is an upgraded version of the Galaxy Pro earbuds.The buds come with a built in noise cancellation technology.The buds can be charged for up to 29 hours without active noise cancellation.There is no available app for iPhones to control the buds.
9,Xs3-9Pz4ED4,Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro Review | Better than Pixel Buds Pro?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs3-9Pz4ED4,Tech Spurt, hello gorgeous peeps I'm Chris from Tex burn and today we're going to be reviewing these gorgeous sweet purple Beauties right here the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro a 219 quid these true wireless earbuds are even more expensive than the already pretty bloody pricey 179 pounds Google pixel buds while offering a lot of the same features including ENC assistant integration yada yada but you've also got 24-bit audio support with certain Samsung blowers you've got Bluetooth 5.3 support bit of Bixby action if that's a good thing I've had the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 pro stuffed to my skull for the last few days using them as my full-time true wireless earbuds so here's my in-depth review I'm also going to do a bit side by side with the rescue Google pixel buds Pro to see which one might be best for you and for more on the latest and greatest Tech please do POG subscribe ending that notifications Bell cheers now you've got a small selection of colors when it comes to the Galaxy buds 2 Pro you can grab them in white or black pretty standard stuff otherwise also this lovely Bora purple effort and frankly they look the nuns tits and just like having soft smooth colorful wee Pebbles lodged in your locals but in a good way I really love that Sleek matte finish no gloss inside so they don't get all greasy as you handle them always a bonus they certainly have a very premium Vibe about them which is just as well as you're spunking up over 200 quid for the buggers my only complaint on the design would be that obvious seam between the front and the back sections although you don't even see that when they are stuffed in your head the buds have a kind of winged section this topic that juts out so when you put them in you just stick them in with a Twist and that little bit kind of embeds itself underneath your ear flap and just helps to keep them very firmly in place I found there's absolutely no shifting around whatsoever even if you're pegging it down the pavement doing a bit of a rubber size and whatever the hell you want to do and just to prove the point launch test and I found that the Galaxy buds 2 Pro were pretty comfortable to wear for a good few hours I didn't feel any buildup of pressure or anything just started to get the usual ear fatigue after around three to four hours at which point yeah definitely good idea to pop them out again so that's pretty similar to what I experienced with the Google pixel buds Pro as well but as far as water resistant goes these are definitely the winners because they're full on ipx7 water resistant whereas the pixel buds are on the ipx4 splash resistant both are fine for you know working out down the gym sweating all over them rocking in a rainstorm all that kind of stuff but these things can actually be submerged in water as well and still survive so if I had to choose between pixel and Samsung based on the design I'd probably go for these because they're slightly more Compact and you've got that water resistance otherwise there's very little between them now when it comes to actually hooking up to your handset where you've got the latest freshest Bluetooth 5.3 support here on the Galaxy buds 2 Pro and the range is absolutely insane slightly better than what I found on the pixel buds Pro I found I could leave my smartphone in the garden and then come into the house Wonder up a flight stairs and it still will be absolutely perfect no cutting out or anything and if you are a Samsung fan well these Galaxy buds 2 Pro will connect seamlessly to pretty much any Sami gear out there certainly any of the latest stuff including a couple of the most recent 2022 televisions and if you've got yourself a Samsung Galaxy watch you can rather helpfully toggle the ANC mode and you can also at any given moment deactivate those touch controls or switch them back on again and also get an accurate readout of your Galaxy buds 2 Pro battery life and owners of Samsung smartphones will also enjoy improved audio quality here on the buds 2 Pro but more on all that in a bit now you do have some control of your Galaxy buds 2 Pro if you dive on into the Bluetooth menu as you can see there on your Samsung smartphone you can again toggle the ANC toggle the touch controls on and off to a few other little bits and pieces but if you don't have a Samsung smartphone or you want deeper customization you'll have to download that Galaxy wearable app this gives you access to all of the other features including voice detect 360 degree audio and you can actually customize those touch controls in here by default as you can see there is just the single tap that is active as well as the touch and hold but you can get a bit of double tap and triple tap action on the go these could only be used for skipping tracks however whereas if you're going to touch and hold for instance you can see exactly what you want each Bud to do when you do long press them again toggle for the ANC you can call a good old Bixby War great mates otherwise you can tweak the volume or bring up Spotify I thought those touch controls Works in absolute charm usually first time I've asking you do exactly what you want to do you've got full tonal feedbacks you know when it has screwed up and even the double Taps and the triple Taps did the job in that wearable app you can also turn on the voice detect feature which is thankfully Switched Off by default this does do what it says on the tin basically when the buds detect that you are talking it will immediately lower the volume of whatever you're listening to and put you into the noise awareness mode so everything that's going on around you is filtered in so the idea is somebody comes up to you starts talking you say oh hello there or whatever and immediately the volume goes down the noise awareness turns on so you can have a conversation without removing the buds and then once it detects you've stopped talking after a few seconds it will then raise the volume back up and put it back into ANC mode or whatever you were in before because this feature ain't much good if you mumbled yourself all day long like I do you'll just find that you're constantly turning on the noise awareness and lowering the volume of your music which ain't great although thankfully it usually doesn't activate when you just blurt out a word of a couple of syllables like bollocks or toss pot or whatever so that's something unlike the pixel buds you'll find plenty of other great features packed in here like find my buds if you have to lose the buggers down the back of the sofa or something so lots of great little tools and stuff to play around with so when it comes to the touch controls and the other features I found again it was a pretty close call between the pixel Buds and the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro but if you are a Samsung phone You've Got Gear like the Samsung Galaxy watch and a Samsung smartphone then you're probably gonna get more out of these buds rather than the pixel efforts as for your assistant Shenanigans while here on the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro you've only got access to Bixby unfortunately Verizon is the Google assistant on the pixel button words fully voice activated as well as the ability to press and hold to call up that assistant if you're feeling a bit self-aware you can if you want to have Bixby announce any upcoming calendar events and also any text messages that pop through on your smartphone but that's it there's no support for any third-party apps unlike on the pixel buds Pro where the good old Google Assistant could read out any WhatsApp messages and other bits that land on your smartphone so I've got to say it certainly as far as the assistant Shenanigans is concerned I preferred the Google pixel buds helps that I prefer the Google Assistant to Bixby anyway now Samsung's fresh new buds do boast a triple mic setup for the active noise cancellation it's not adapter VNC uh just like the pixel buds does an absolutely fine job of dampening down traffic sounds and other background bollocks that's going on all around you not the absolute best out there not as good as the likes of the buzzers and the Sony's but does a pretty damn fine job means you can stroll down a busy bustling High Street and listen to a podcast or an audiobook without having to boost the volume all the way up and risk wrecking your hearing just don't expect them to completely drown every everything out and leave you in complete silence because that ain't gonna happen the good news is like the pixel Buzz there's no wind feedback or anything as well so overall it is a good experience so yeah between these and the pixel buds definitely a draw as far as the noise canceling goes but what about the audio quality well the sound has once again been fine-tuned by AKG here and it's mighty impressive stuff Samsung's updated seamless codec means you get full 24-bit audio here that sound is no longer down sampled to just 16 bit so it's great news for high-res audio fans but and it is a pretty big but if you want to enjoy that top quality 24-bit audio you will need a Samsung smartphone running the latest one UI four and I've got to say on the default settings I really enjoyed the audio that has been spaffed into my log Hall certainly the likes of metal Rock a bit of hip-hop as well all sounded great some nice respectable base from something so dinky but it didn't drown out the higher end output vocals really shine as well so great news for podcasting audiobook lovers especially and if you're enjoying a bit of video on YouTube the plus your Netflix or anything like that you've got full Dolby Atmos support here as well for that nice cinematic surround sound experience so overall while I also enjoyed the sound quality of the Google pixel buds the buds 2 Pro certainly win if again you've got a Samsung smartphone especially as the pixel buds they didn't support ldac or aptx HD or any of those top end codecs that you would expect from a pair of Premium true wireless earbuds I know it's time for a jolly spiff and old mic test and I'm recording this audio using the Galaxy buds 2 Pro built-in microphones just a nice quiet Studio environment here but I have found that they work really well when out and about as well even with a lot of background noise and just to prove that point I'm now recording this portion of the audio sample while still next to my speaker which is blurring out really loud traffic sounds and as you can hear the Galaxy buds 2 Pro microphone still clearly picking up my voice despite all of that background noise and last up the battery life in here on the Galaxy buds 2 Pro I found that the battery life reliably dropped just under 20 for every hour of use and that was with the ENC turned on so I got just over the quartered five hours of use with the noise cancellation and then when they are drained you can just bung them back and they're very cute and colorful little box which actually mirrors the color of the buds themselves this could fully recharge the buds just over two times in also giving you just under 20 hours of battery life from a full charge of the case and the buds saw not as strong as many rivals unfortunately a lot of them do tend to hit sort of 25 30 hours and unfortunately the pixel buds do win in this round as well because they tend to offer sort of six to seven hours of use with that ANC turned on but like the pixel Buzz the kiss is again incredibly dinky and smooth and curvy as well so very easy to slip into any pocket or bag going and for added convenience the actual cases themselves can be charged wirelessly if you have to have reverse wireless charging on your smartphone for instance otherwise you've got a good bit of type c USB port action you just slap in a wire job done and all right there's my full final Frank review of the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro and a bit of side-by-side action with the pixel buds just to see how they stack out up I gotta say I really really do like these true wireless earbuds but if you don't have all this Samsung Gear to go with it the likes of the Galaxy watch your Samsung smartphone of course to really enjoy the full range of features as well as that top quality audio well it's not worth that money instead I would say maybe go for the pixel buds Pro or maybe the Huawei buds something else a little bit more affordable instead anyway that's

10,IFDjXh8WqEE,Galaxy Buds 2 Pro Long Term Review,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFDjXh8WqEE,Vladimir Kostek, I purchased the Galaxy buds 2 Pro on launch day since I was so pleased with the standard Galaxy buds 2 I've tested them in all sorts of environments and have even discovered two cool little hacks I'll share towards the end of the video to improve your overall experience with the buds 2 Pro I'll also share my long-term thoughts using the earphones with my Galaxy s23 Ultra daily driven phone in terms of the fit and finish of the Galaxy buds 2 Pro they now have a matte design so it is a lot grippier and I find that it slips around a lot less when I'm pulling it out of my pocket or pulling it out of a bag of some sort now they are also reduced in size by about 15% compared to last year's model that just means that the fit is sleeker and Slimmer overall and fits a lot more flush in your ear if you're looking at someone heads on it almost looks like you have nothing in your ear until you kind of turn to the side that is not the case with the previous Pro buds or these specific buds 2 here because of this matte texture the marks are a little bit more visible on the matte case versus the glossy case therefore I'll recommend a case protector it makes some pretty cool ones and they're relatively inexpensive but if you're worried about that it's a good option so in terms of the actual ergonomic fit in your ear these fit super well I've actually never had a problem even with my buds too which are a little heavier and bigger I've never had them fall out you know whatever I seem to do I just can't shake them out but I would say that in general I kind of readjust them maybe every 30 minutes or so when I'm wearing them while I'm working out or just kind of walking around it will be interesting to see if they add the wing tip design that they used to have on Old generations of buds like the wing tips on the buds Fe that they announced a couple weeks ago at their unpacked event the nice thing about the black case and black buds is that it really doesn't show dirt or Grime or ear wax while I do kind of clean them every month or every two months the white buds here they just show everything and these I have to clean like every couple weeks or else they just really start to look kind of gross and disgusting so just note that they do make a uh a purple version which is called Bora purple and they make the graph version which is this and then they make the White Version as well this video is launching around Prime day so I'll link the buds below they do typically go on sale I saw them today at 178 discounted from 230 and I've seen them actually a little bit lower to in the 150 range you can certainly buy them refurbished which I'll put links to as well and then you're getting into the 120 130 range if you're buying recertified or refurbished ones in terms of the audio quality the Galaxy buds 2 Pro now have Bluetooth 5.3 which results in really rock solid connection never had any dropouts here one of the biggest marketed features that Samsung kind of put into this device was the 24-bit audio that can be upscaled from 16bit to 24-bit assuming that you have a Samsung device that can do that it's a SSC so it's Samsung seamless codec and this feature works very well and I really attribute the increase in audio quality to SSC where it upsamples 16bit to 24-bit also when I use my s23 ultra if I play flax samples that are actually 24-bit native these sound incredible and they're probably one of the closest experiences I've had to my wired headphones in DAC the Shandling q1 and the Shandling ae3 headphones which pair super well together I've done videos on those if you'd like to check that out these are the first buds I think they've really marketed as Studio buds so they have some artists that they put some promo videos out I could actually see these being used in the studio while IMS are typically the standard and I would think would be just better in general if you were in a pinch I think you probably could use these that's how good the sound is the 360 audio in my opinion is kind of a gimmick it does add more volume in general but the head tracking just is very odd it's like very positionally directed so if you move at all it's you're kind of like the source is right here and it's just a strange experience overall I wouldn't recommend that compared to the buds Pro or the buds 2 there is more of a base presence here and I think that just comes down to the better fit of the device in your ear now I was telling you about some hacks in the beginning one of them is actually getting foam tips so those will will provide better passive isolation and will provide better base response partially because of blocking external sound better and creating a better kind of resonance chamber but also because they go deeper into the ear canal so I'll link some of those below those are are kind of cool options by default in the Box they only offer two other tips so there's like a small a medium and a large and a USBC cable that's it besides a WF 1000 XM 5s from Sony these are probably some of the best wireless headphones that I've heard and while I've tried those I kind of stuck with these because I do have an s23 ultra and the integration of the ecosystem is just that good so for some really good news when enabling transparency the Galaxy buds 2 for example are just terrible they have constant wind noise these are actually the first buds besides the world's first wireless headphones the broi dash which I reviewed I'll put up here for you those had a wind transparency feature and it was quite good actually some of the best I've never seen anything surpass it yet but the Galaxy buds 2 Pro come really close they take a second for the algorithm to pick up the wind noise and then cut out the actual kind of buffeting that it causes in the microphone holes but I can actually bike ride with these which I can't say about many wireless headphones speaking of transparency the voice detection in these is actually decent it detects your voice very well but I personally think that this should have been kept in the labs feature because if you're someone that sings let's be honest most of us kind of sing along to song Sometimes it will activate and it just ends up being more of a nuisance than it is helpful I like the ability in the app to disable the touch controls so sometimes if I'm outside and I have like a rain jacket on when you put these in your ear if the rain jacket gets wet the capacitive kind of touch on the device will trigger transparency or it'll like stop and play your song so it's nice to actually be able to disable those speaking of other features in the app the ability to pair with smart things and find your buds is nice also one of the features I enjoy is the neck stretch reminder so if you if you kind of just are in a bad posture it will remind you and let's be honest most of us don't have good posture so that's kind of a useful feature in terms of the EQ options there's a good amount of modes I prefer the dynamic one myself but depending on what I'm listening on I would like to have the feature of a full custom EQ it's really odd that they show the EQ graph in the app but don't give you the option to customize it completely the way you want that would just be a really easy software push like Bose when the QC 45s I reviewed those when those came came out they didn't have that feature and then 6 months later they added the EQ option so uh hopefully maybe I mean it's already been a year plus but maybe Samsung could add that someday the gaming mode is pretty good because these have 5.3 I really don't notice much latency in general the gaming mode does improve it a little bit and is kind of cool when you're playing games or if you're I don't know in a car that has an older Bluetooth system if you enable that you'll get slightly better response now for one of the other little tricks in the labs part of the app they have a double tap feature where you're supposed to like kind of double tap the bottom of the bud but honestly if you just double tap your like kind of upper cheek here or on this side if you have a button here that will lower the volume and increase the volume and it works really well like 99% of the time when I double tap it uh kind of does that feature so that's actually a feature that's in labs and has been for a little bit bit that I think could be a main feature the batter's uh pretty Rock Solid in my opinion some people have complained about it but it's 5 hours with active noise cancelling 8 hours without I've never been in a situation where I need more than that and one of the cool things is it does have wireless charging I have the s23 so if I just pop it on the back I can charge it right away and it charges up decently quickly this has saved me multiple times where my phone's Juiced up and I can pass over some charge to the headphones and not be without buds I'm actually working on a long-term review of this s23 Ultra which is my daily driver so if you'd like to see that stay tuned and guys if you'd like to see my favorite over thear headphones I will put that video here so you can check that out I also did a long-term review of these,Galaxy Buds2 Pro,The Galaxy buds 2 Pro have a matte design so it is a lot grippier and I find that it slips around a lot less when I'm pulling it out of my pocket or pulling it out of a bag of some sort now they are also reduced in size by about

11,dg4pGN0-h7Y,Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro Review: My Ears Are Happy Now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg4pGN0-h7Y,CNET, hi there i've got samsung's 230 galaxy buds 2 pro here which i keep referring to as the galaxy buds pro 2 because that's what i think the second generation of the galaxy buds pro should be called but hey i don't get to name products i just review them and i will say that these buds have an all-around better design than their predecessor which just didn't fit my ears all that well with the ear tips that were included not only are they 15 smaller but they weigh slightly less 5.5 grams per bud versus 6.3 grams and have a soft to the touch matte finish on both the buzz in case that gives them a nicer feel and makes them a bit more grippy and that finish also makes the compact case a little less likely to slip out of your hand and more importantly it helps keep the buds in your ears a little more securely and thanks to their new shape and smaller size i was able to get a tight seal with the largest set of included ear tips and didn't have to supply my own i can't say they'll fit all ears equally well but they should provide a better fit to more ears than the original galaxy buds pro [Music] aside from the revamped design samsung is touting the bud's improved noise cancelling and support for 24-bit high-resolution audio the catch is that to get that 24-bit audio you need a galaxy device equipped with samsung's one ui 4.0 and a music streaming service like qoba's title or amazon music that streams high-res audio tracks on all other devices including android phones and iphones the buds default to the aac audio codec they use bluetooth 5.3 alas they don't support the more common aptx adaptive audio codec for android devices only the new samsung seamless hifi codec which samsung says delivers 256 times more sound data than 16-bit cd quality audio numbers like that are a bit deceptive because based on my experience you're really only going to notice a small difference when streaming higher bitrate tracks but more on that after i ran out the rest of the feature set these have touch controls they work well but don't offer much in the way of customization and galaxy device owners can activate hands-free bixby samsung's voice assistant samsung's 360 audio virtual surround feature with head tracking returns in an enhanced version and now works with a variety of galaxy devices out of the gate though it's not compatible with other android devices it works along the same lines as apple's spatial audio feature for airpods and can enhance your movie and tv watching experience though it doesn't seem to be as pronounced as apple spatial audio which i think is slightly better overall it also works with music or any audio you're listening to the buds 2 pro are ipx7 water resistant which means they can withstand being fully submerged in one meter deep water for up to 30 minutes i had no problem running with them and they didn't slip out of my ears like their predecessor battery life is rated at five hours with noise cancelling on and eight hours with it off at moderate volume levels and you get about three additional charges in the case which charges via usbc and wirelessly some people are complaining that five hours is pretty mediocre and yeah it is but it's hard to shrink buds while increasing battery life and there is a quick charge feature to get you an hour use when you drop the buzz in the case for five minutes or two hours with a 10 minute charge so those battery life numbers weren't a deal breaker for me sensors detect when the buds are in your ears and will pause your music when you take both buds out of your ears but what's a little weird is they won't resume playback when you put them back in your ears without you tapping on one of the butts you can use a single bud while leaving the other one in the case additionally you can opt to activate a voice detect mode in the galaxy wearable companion app that automatically turns off noise canceling and switches to ambient mode when you speak allowing you to hear the outside world and engage in a conversation with someone sony offers a similar feature with this wf-1000x mark iv and link buds s earbuds another new feature worth mentioning has nothing to do with audio you can toggle on the next stretch reminder setting that detects your head position alerts you when you bend your head downward for 10 minutes that's a good one for all of us who stare down at our phones all the time while these have a find my buds feature that samsung calls smartthings fine it doesn't offer the more precise tracking capabilities of apple's enhanced find my in its latest airpods it just tells you the location where the bus last connected to your device you don't get true multi-point bluetooth pairing that allows you to pair the butt simultaneously with any two bluetooth enabled devices such as a phone and a computer but they do offer auto switching between samsung devices logged into your samsung account including samsung tvs built in 2022 or later and samsung's galaxy books laptops built after 2020. i haven't thoroughly tested the auto switching feature with many samsung devices because i just don't own that many samsung devices so i can't confirm exactly how reliably it works but feel free to let me know about any experiences you've had with it in the comments section samsung says it's improved the noise cancelling on the galaxy buds 2 pro by 40 percent it calls it intelligent anc now i have found it an improvement on the original galaxy but pro but noise cancelling performance is affected by how tight a seal you get from the ear tips so your perception of how much is improved may vary by how good a seal you get i thought the noise cancelling was close but not quite there with that of the noise cancelling the sony wf1000x mach 4 buds but it did a good job muffling a variety of noise on the streets of new york and in the subway you can turn the noise canceling off or activate ambient mode the equivalent of apple's transparency mode which i thought sounded pretty natural but there's no setting to adjust noise canceling levels it automatically adapts to your environment i appreciate that the buds 2 pro are equipped with two-way drivers a 10 millimeter woofer and 5.3 millimeter tweeter along with three microphones two of which are being forming for voice calls i paired the buds with a galaxy z flip 3 iphone 13 pro and google pixel 4 xl and stream music using quobas i also stream some movies from google play and netflix according to samsung there's no way to check whether you're getting 24 bit audio nothing indicates whether you are or you aren't but if your audio setup meets the list of requirements be using the samsung seamless hifi codec which transmits in 24 bit assuming your audio files support it i found it irritating there's no way to tell what bit rate you're streaming at but i'll have to take samsung's word that i was getting 24 bit audio i did notice a small difference when streaming tracks from quobas with the galaxy z flip 3 however using the iphone 13 pro the sound quality was also very good with an amply wide sound stage i went back and forth with different tracks and the flip 3 sound came across slightly more accurately the touch more detailed depth and clarity the base is punchy and well defined and i didn't experience any noticeable distortion at higher volumes in short they're excellent sounding buds but i'm not sure they're superior to other top earbuds in their price range including the pixelbuds pro beatsfit pro and sennheiser momentum true wireless 3 but their sound is a noticeable step up from the sound of the standard galaxy buds 2 particularly in terms of clarity i mostly went with the default sound setting though you can tweak the signature profile in the galaxy wearable app with some preset equalizer settings including a bass boost setting the truth is a lot of these premium priced earbuds are starting to sound pretty similar and it's really the fit and how they fit your particular ears that's going to make you like one more than another once again samsung has delivered a set of galaxy buttons that work well as a headset for making calls they have good voice pick up from the beam forming microphones while providing good background noise reduction callers so they could hear me relatively clearly in the noisy streets of new york and the buds did a decent job reducing wind noise they're in the upper echelon in terms of voice calling performance i'm in the streets of new york city here and i'm talking to john falcone a fellow editor how do i sound john there's a little bit of wind in the background here and some traffic is going by well if you're on a fairly noisy city street i'd have to rate the experience on my end as very good to excellent just hear a very slight kind of hiss that we sometimes get with noise cancelling but your voice is coming over loud and clear no artifacts or distractions and just a really good experience for the listener on my end all right i'll talk a little bit more now there as the traffic goes by you can see there's a lot of traffic a little bit of wind here big truck going by so hopefully you can hear me for better or worse galaxy butts have always been an accessory for galaxy smartphones and as a result more geared toward the owners of galaxy devices the galaxy buds 2 pro are no exception they're excellent earbuds but you do lose some of their key features if you're not a galaxy device owner for that reason it's easy to see them as the samsung equivalent of the airpods pro which may very well get some sort of high resolution wireless streaming option with the arrival of the airpods pro 2 that will likely use proprietary apple technology that only works with its devices by comparison the pixel buds pro have fewer features geared exclusively toward pixel owners and such features as hands-free google assistant and true multi-point bluetooth pairing are available across all android devices however the pixelbuds pro have no enhanced audio codec support which may be important if you're convinced it makes a big difference i personally think it only makes a slight difference with this class of earbuds which may have a premium price tag but aren't really high end the bigger question will be whether it's worth upgrading to the galaxy buzz 2 pro if you already own a pair of galaxy buds particularly the original galaxy buds pro i think that will largely depend on what price you can get the galaxy butts 2 pro for while their list price is 230 samsung is currently offering trade-in deals of any galaxy buzz in any condition that bring their price down to around 155 and you can often get deals on them as part of a bundle with a new galaxy phone for me anyway while the galaxy buzz 2 pro offers some legitimate performance improvements over their predecessor their design is the biggest upgrade that makes them the best galaxy buds yet but let me know what you guys think if you're a current galaxy buds pro owner are you going to upgrade to the buds 2 pro and would you still consider getting them even if you're not a samsung device owner sound off in the comment section if you're interested in any of the products mentioned check out the description below for links on where to find them and you can get even more details in my text review on cnet lastly if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david carnoy thanks for watching [Music],Galaxy Buds2 Pro,These buds have an all-around better design than their predecessor.They weigh slightly less 5.5 grams per bud versus 6.3 grams and have a soft to the touch matte finish on both the buzz in case that gives them a nicer feel and makes them a bit more grippy and that finish also makes the compact case a little less likely to slip out of your hand.Battery life is rated at five hours with noise cancelling on and eight hours with it off at moderate volume levels and you get about three additional charges in the case. The wf-1000x mark and link buds s earbuds come in two sizes.The 2 buds are equipped with two-way drivers a 10 millimeter and 5.3 millimeter tweeter along with three microphones.The pixel pro beats true wireless pro and find my top feature that calls smartthings fine. A lot of these premium earbuds are starting to sound pretty similar.It's really the fit and how they fit your particular ears that's going to make you like one more than another.The buds did a decent job reducing wind noise they're in the upper echelon in terms of voice calling performance.
12,nNUHFn_hxsE,Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review | Great till they ain&#39;t,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNUHFn_hxsE,Digital Trends, so we're getting into the busy part of the year google has dropped new phones new earbuds new software all bunch of toys we're getting ready for the iphone 14 at apple's fall event and yes samsung is just off its latest unpacked event i was actually there at the first one 200 years ago we've got the new z-fold 4 in the new z flip 4 and on the phone side of things they're definitely pretty exciting today we're going to look at these the samsung galaxy buds 2 pro there's a lot to like here there's a lot here i'm not quite so crazy about i'm phil nickinson this is digital trends do me a favor go do all the things like subscribe hit the bells all the video stuff you know you need to do right all right let's go so first the basics of the galaxy buds 2 pro there's just not a lot going on in the box here you get the buds the case and the usbc cable even though these charge just fine on a wireless charger which is how i prefer to do it so the buds 2 pro retail for 229 we're already seeing discounts from samsung itself and chances are you'll see them cheaper from other retailers too but on paper that makes them more expensive than the google pixel buds pro but less expensive than the apple airpods pro the butts 2 pro are about 15 smaller than last year's version samsung says they've got active noise cancellation built in they've got spatial audio stuff we'll talk about in a minute they have this newfangled 24-bit audio codec stuff we'll also talk about in a minute and they're available in any color you want so long as it's black white or this sort of lilac-y purple that i actually kind of like a lot so what do i like here well first they fit and they feel great they're super light they fit almost flush with your ear because they're so small so if i'm looking at you straight on there's a good chance you won't even tell i've got them in all in all i say the fit is about the same as the google pixel beds pro more that than airpods pro it's just a really light feel in the ear it doesn't make you feel like you're in a vacuum at all so that's really nice and while it's a light fit i haven't had any problem with them popping out especially while i'm at the gym on the elliptical doing all that stuff grunting making weird weight faces they've stayed in just fine and as an added bonus these purple colors look like you have a little purple easter egg candy thing in your ear but please don't do that the point is it's a really good fit okay samsung has nailed it there love it [Music] so the next most important thing how do they sound well when you're doing normal things like listening to music or podcasts or whatever they sound really good uh there's enough bass in here to be enjoyable but not too much that it overpowers the rest of the music the highs come through nicely without thinning out or getting muddy way up there all in all i think samsung has done a nice job of just a really good overall balanced sound now the usual caveats apply here right these are going to fit in my ears a little differently than yours a lot of it depends on the environmental noise are you listening in a gym are you listening at home are you in a car on a plane whatever that affects everything right and speaking of noise so yes these have active noise cancellation and c on board samsung's done a pretty good job there again you have to take the totality of the earbuds into account here so the way they fit in your ears and then the tuning of the anc itself and it's pretty good it doesn't quite go as heavy i think as apple does it's really more along the lines of the pixel buds pro which i liked a lot so it blocks out most of the external sound a little bit still gets through and i'm okay with that i don't want to look and sound and feel like i'm in a vacuum that's just not a comfortable thing for me so again that's a plus on samsung here they did a good job and because it's still a thing people do phone calls sound fine too you sound like you're on earbuds okay it's not great it's not awful it works well enough i've gotten a little bit of wind noise coming through on my end uh you know on the other side i think we're all just used to it by now right it works as advertised so where things start to fall apart for me here is with the spatial audio if you've never used it instead of sound just coming from the left or from the right they sort of tune things so it's coming from above and behind and beside in 360 degrees that's where the term comes from 360 audio samsung's is just not as good as what we've experienced particularly on apples right so first the quality of the sound itself music just thins way out it's not good it sounds overly processed because it is because that's what's going on right and samsung also has head tracking in here don't even bother turning it on it's not good so as you turn your head the music follows you it's always kind of coming right at the center of you depending on which way you're facing it's odd a lot of people don't like it at all just in general but samsung's version of it sort of puts these invisible lines up in the air as i'm turning i can see exactly when it's shifting from one earbud to the other that's not great apple's experience with that is so much more fluid doesn't mean i necessarily like it but it is better and really all that's kind of a pity because other than that these buds sound just fine and then there's the whole 24-bit audio thing this is a big spec that samsung is pushing it has its own codec that will actually take lower quality 16-bit audio and upscale it to 24-bit there are some caveats here right first you're gonna have to be using a samsung device it's a samsung specific codec so that's that second there's no like toggle to turn it on and off so unless you know you're a real audiophile and you're often switching between different earbuds and different devices you're not going to notice this at all does it affect the overall sound of these earbuds sure if that's what makes them sound as good as they do on a day-to-day basis awesome is it a reason to buy these absolutely not it's just a marketing line for me so samsung says you will get five hours of continuous playback with these earbuds uh with noise cancellation turned on pop them back in the case and it's got enough battery in there for another 18 hours again you'll have to charge it a couple times right i don't use mine that way at all i don't know about you let me know in the comments but you know five hours at a clip is a long time for earbuds now samsung has a companion app that works across android devices which is great you're not locked into just samsung that's important it's how you get to things like all the different settings and options update the firmware on the earbuds that's always important so good on samsung for doing that you will get a slightly easier pairing experience on a samsung device to me that's not a huge deal especially when you have the app available so one of the features you definitely want to check out is voice detect i like that a lot so that's one where when it hears you talking it will turn noise cancellation off turn transparency on lower the volume all that stuff so you can actually have a conversation with somebody that's kind of cool i like that uh one thing i do recommend there though is flip the setting to go back to normal anc mode flip that to five seconds instead of ten tens just a really long time now there's also some quick switching that lets you connect them to multiple devices at once and hop back and forth you're going to need a samsung account for that so if you're not kind of in the samsung ecosystem chances are that's not going to be a big plus for you there's also a little fit test section and other settings you'd probably expect to find in earbuds these days that's pretty normal fair and then there's my favorite neck stretching there's a neck stretching reminder in here because who doesn't stretch their neck enough every day i certainly don't i'm sure you don't either it's the only knack we got you got to take care of it the point is if it detects that you've had your head down like this for 10 minutes it's going to remind you to stretch your neck so stretch your neck there's also a find my feature that will help you locate your missing buds there are some accessibility features that's always great to see thanks to samsung for that and you have some preset eq options i tell you i've tried them all i didn't find that any of them really made the music sound any better in fact i think they made them worse so i've just left it on normal the whole time so it's a lot on some little earbuds here's the bottom line for me on the galaxy buds 2 pro they're pretty good uh everyday music podcasts all that stuff they sound really good actually i would order them on great the fit and the feel is excellent samsung nailed that i have no notes noise cancellation pretty good uh maybe not the best but it's good enough for me and it does it in the way that i like it so i don't feel like i'm in an anechoic chamber like i'm in a vacuum it's comfortable it works and it does the job the way it's supposed to spatial audio stuff 360 audio that's where it falls apart it's not good i'm not going to use it on these buds i'm never going to turn the head tracking back on it was just not a good experience and you know this is another one of those times where i think ecosystem comes into play apple's got air pods for its phones and tablets google has the new pixel buds pro for its line and samsung of course has its own earbuds and these aren't the only earbuds from samsung right they've been doing this a long time they've gotten pretty good at it and the point is you're going to get a fuller experience with these earbuds on a samsung phone that's by design and it's not surprising right so if you're in the samsung ecosystem i would absolutely look at these if you're on some other android phone i'd probably go pixel and if you're on ios these work just fine with an iphone but i'd probably go earpods so in a nutshell look you can do better than these you can also do a lot worse okay i don't hate them by any stretch of the imagination and if you're a card-carrying member of the samsung knights and i know you are i think you're going to be plenty happy with the galaxy buds 2 pro that's it for the galaxy buds 2 pro be sure to like the video subscribe to the channel you know all the stuff that's it we'll see you next time,Galaxy Buds2 Pro,"The Galaxy buds 2 pro are Google's new earbuds for the iPhone 14.The buds come in black,

14,L8-5oPhPey4,Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 Review,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5oPhPey4,Mike O'Brien, hey everyone welcome to the channel my name is mike and in this video we're talking about a really exciting pair of earbuds or at least one that i've been waiting for for a really long time and this is the sequel to one of my all-time favorite pairs of earbuds which were the sennheiser momentum true wireless twos in this video we have the sennheiser momentum true wireless threes now before we get into the threes i want to talk very briefly about the twos for a while they were my favorite pair of earbuds because they had really the best sound in my opinion they ranked really high on the best premium earbuds video i made on the best earbuds to buy in 2020 2021 and now we finally have a sequel which is like i said long awaited because even though i really liked the momentum true wireless twos they had their drawbacks for one they used a kind of antiquated connection style where you couldn't use just one earbud you had to have both out of the case in order for them to work another thing is they didn't have wireless charging they didn't have some other features that a lot of earbuds had and so for those reasons they kind of felt antiquated but still had great sound and now with the momentum true wireless threes sennheiser came out with a pair of earbuds that is better in almost all regards making them a really strong candidate for my favorite pair of earbuds and they made them cheaper instead of the massive 300 price tag on the twos these are 250 which i know is still definitely expensive but we'll take any cut we can get on that price especially because over time they're likely to go on sale anyway all right and now if you're not convinced on the 250 price tag let's get into the sound now the sound is really going to be probably the main reason anybody's buying these earbuds in my opinion they're probably the best sounding earbuds on the market right now or at least bluetooth wireless earbuds on the market right now and i'm going to explain kind of why that is so sennheiser now has three different levels of earbuds they've got the cx the cx plus and then they've got these which definitely do sound better these have a clean analytical sound profile very detailed with honestly pretty amazing clarity when you're listening to more complex songs with a lot of instruments the depth into in the instrument separation of these in my opinion really makes you understand why sennheiser consistently ranks as one of the best sounding brands in wireless earbuds overall a really natural sound to these and listening these is pleasant and enjoyable regardless of the genre at least in my opinion and of course as always sennheiser has their unique sound signature and and for me personally it's always been my favorite among wireless earbuds as i said but of course everyone has their own preferences so if you love extremely bass heavy music these still do deliver if you turn on the bass the extra bass boost on the app but i will admit that some people who are looking for just like massive bass distortion like if that's what you want and you just go to the gym and you're listening to rap or edm these might not be like the best purchase for you but in my opinion these sound a lot more like what the artist would actually want the music to sound like and of course if you're listening to high fidelity audio files you can make great use of the aptx or aptx adaptive codecs on here especially if you're using like an android phone for example but they also have sbc and aac codecs that work well for iphones and smart tvs or whatever other devices that you might want to use but even if you're listening to something with a lower bitrate for example like spotify in my opinion these will still give you an amazing listening experience thanks to their natural balance and pretty responsive drivers so it makes the music sound really fun and lively while still giving you a lot of the high end details again great instrument separation but these do tend to have a slight de-emphasis on the treble frequencies you kind of have to listen hard for that so i do like to boost the the treble up by maybe a few decibels in the eq but like i said really an impressive pair of earbuds and as far as the sound goes these are really quite amazing now as far as the active noise cancellation goes you guys might remember when the sennheiser momentum true islands twos came out i said they had one of the best ancs in the industry now at the time the competition was a lot weaker and as these aged many other earbuds kind of passed these and became a lot stronger but the new momentum threes here actually are substantially better so i just did the classic test where i play some white noise on a speaker and i listen to at what level i can actually hear that it's an imperfect test but just for a relative idea of how strong the anc is on the old momentum true ls2s which when it came out i thought were among the best i was able to hear at about level 19 or level 20. and on these which have an adaptive anc i wasn't able to hear that same sound until about level 23 or 24 so substantially more powerful and also a really nice clean active noise cancellation but it is adaptive so you don't really have to change the level wherever you are it's going to kind of listen to what's around you and use basically less power if you're in a quieter environment the anti-wind mode is also really nice if you're outside a lot of the older models didn't have that so i really like having that but again the ansi does a pretty decent job the adjustable transparency mode is also really nice to have as well although the play with music and pause music feature was a little bit confusing but regardless it was nice that we did have transparency on here so with that being said let's get into what's different about these what the design the the sound everything that you need to know about these like i said there is a lot it's really better in every single regard but let's start off with just the basics right here the case itself doesn't really look that different and i'm going to point out that's actually one of the first subtle drawbacks here a lot of cases are smaller these days i don't really feel like it's a drawback for me uh being like a male i have larger pockets but i could see like some women might have smaller pockets and not want to carry this that's going to be a bit of a drawback but i love the aesthetic of this one they still have a nice premium fabric look all the way around the case and now they actually have a third color so i have a black one a white one and this is actually their gray one so it's kind of in between color personally i think all of them look really good the charging is now on the front and here's a big positive it now has wireless charging so you no longer have to plug this in and pick it up on your desk and it's so much nicer when i take it out of my pocket i get to my desk i just set it on the wireless charging pad and it feels like i'm never charging my earbuds and then opening up the case this is probably my favorite upgrade here the earbuds themselves are substantially smaller that was one of the big drawbacks of the original and the second generation sennheiser momentum true wireless earbuds they're just so massive but these not only are they physically smaller in just about every dimension but they also have more rounded edges so the overall aesthetic design gives you the illusion of being even smaller than they are so i think that that was a massive improvement there and plus although you don't have that shiny exterior that we're used to seeing i love how they kind of made it a little bit more subtle a little bit more modern looking so you know not everyone wants to have a shiny metal circle in their ear sometimes it's nice to have something really subtle like this and looking at it you'll notice that the exterior has a little bit of a little bit of a ring a little bit of a bump around that which is another really big benefit like i said the physical design of this really has been improved massively this now has a wingtip on there which is something that we haven't really seen in a lot of other earbuds since like the galaxy buds really a lot of them have getting been getting rid of that but it's something i love to have because holding them in your ear with just a silicone tip it works fine but if your ears are sweaty or if you just everybody has different shaped ears right having a wingtip is another fit in there another way to customize the fit so it stays in your ears even if you're working out even if your ears are sweaty now we do have four different silicone actual ear tips themselves and these have like a little foam piece on the inside so you will want to make sure you're cleaning these but it's kind of a nice way to get a solid seal in your ear so you get the best attenuation you also get great isolation so it's going to block a lot a lot of sound around you without even turning on the active noise cancellation of course we'll talk about the anc later but the physical design again lots and lots of positives these also have mono mode now so i can take out just one earbud at a time it doesn't matter the left or the right which is a great way to save battery or whatever you might be doing if you just want one maybe it's uncomfortable in your other ear great feature i love having that these do have of course auto play and auto pause when you put them in your ear or take them out the led is on the inside so no one else can see that but you can still see when it's pairing or whatever it might be doing the battery level for example and then really the last thing to mention on the physical design is that we still have the touch pads on the outside personally i think these are easier to touch now they're very very responsive and i haven't had any missed touches at all it's perfect right on the outside and of course they check a lot of the standard boxes as well with an ipx4 water resistance rating seven hours of battery in the earbuds 28 when you include the case and of course a 10 minute charge gives you one hour of listening but let's get into something a little bit more interesting the actual features that have been added to these earbuds if you get the sennheiser my sound app this actually has a lot of cool things in there it's been redesigned and so in here of course you have connections is the first thing but although these don't allow you to connect to multiple devices at the same time you can connect to them separately and then use the app to switch between them so it's not quite perfect you can't just seamlessly switch like you can with airpods or jabra earbuds but it's kind of a close-ish second on top of that the app also gives you this really cool thing called sound zones so sound zones it's kind of exactly what it sounds like you use the gps on your phone to detect where you are and change the sound settings accordingly so when you go to your office when you go to the gym when you're at home you're probably going to have different sound settings you want and you can automatically have those changed with your phone and the equalizer although it's a lot more intuitive now and they have the bass boost and the podcast mode as well you can actually instead just go and do the sound check which is going to kind of test you your hearing and your frequencies and let you know what the best eq is for you so you can really find a custom the custom sound for yourself of course going down we've got transparency and adaptive noise cancellation that i'm going to actually test out and talk about in just a second and really the last thing down here is customizing the touch control so i always really liked how sennheiser allows you to customize the touch controls really in depth so you can actually customize pretty much any one the single the double the the triple press or the press and hold to do one of many different many different functions including voice assistant change anc levels power it on and off play the previous track next track whatever it might be there's a lot of functionality there and again the touch controls were really responsive and did a great job these also have bluetooth 5.2 so like i said before that does allow you to use just one earbud at a time and so really a pretty good connection there and now let's get into a microphone test so this is what it sounds like if i were to be on a phone call with you using the sennheiser momentum true wireless threes i'm in a studio environment so this is going to sound probably as good as they can but of course the three microphones really the benefit of having more per earbud is that when you're outside it's windy and there's a louder noise around you more ambient noise they should be better at filtering out sound so let's go out there and actually test it out all right so this is a microphone test i'm outdoors i'm in a park right now there's a river right there that's flowing pretty loud um there's a bunch of traffic driving on a road right there so honestly it's hard for me to hear myself but we'll see how good these microphones actually block out the sound leave a comment and let me know what you think of these so are these my new favorite earbuds that i'm going to wear every day now i mean it's hard to say i've only been listening to these for about the past five days but as far as the sound quality goes i think without a doubt these are my favorite sounding earbuds at least right now and the active noise cancellation does a great job the new redesign was was really much needed so i think these have a really strong chance at being the best earbuds on the market for a more premium price tier but of course if you're looking for something a little bit cheaper i've made videos about all different price categories from a hundred dollars fifty dollars there's so many other earbuds out there and the good news is the cheaper earbuds are getting better and better so i'll link some of those videos down below if you guys are on a budget if you want these i'll have a link in the description as well and if you enjoyed the video consider liking and subscribing i'm mike o'brien thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music],Sennheiser MTW3,This is the sequel to one of my alltime favorite pairs of earbuds which were the sennheiser momentum true wireless twos.With the momentum true wireless threes sennheiser came out with a pair of earbuds that is better in almost all regards making them a really strong candidate for my favorite pair of earbuds. sennheiser consistently ranks as one of the best sounding brands in wireless earbuds overall. The old momentum true ls2s which when it came out i thought were among the best i was able to hear at about level 19 or level 20.The adaptive anc is adaptive so you don't really have to change the level wherever you are.The anti-wind mode is also really nice if you're outside a lot of the older models didn't have that. The sennheiser momentum true wireless threes are my favorite sounding earbuds at least right now.The three microphones really the benefit of having more per earbud is that when you're outside it's windy and there's a louder noise around you more ambient noise they should be better at filtering out sound.The app also gives you this really cool thing called sound zones so sound zones it's kind of exactly what it sounds like you use the gps on your phone to detect where you are and change the sound settings accordingly.
15,4g2TqWYn-cg,Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 (review): Sony Slayer?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g2TqWYn-cg,CNET, hey there i have sennheiser's momentum true wireless three earbuds here and i have to admit i was pretty excited to get my hands on these the previous model was really good but it did leave a little room for improvement so i was curious to see how sennheiser upgraded this third generation version and how it stacks up to other top noise cancelling earbuds like sony's wf-1000x mark iv let's talk about that [Music] okay for starters these cost a little less though they're still pretty pricey the momentum true wireless ii let's call them the mtw-2 for short listed for 300. they've been selling for 250 or less online the mtw 3 are 250 out of the gate and i suspect we'll see them for closer to 200 in the not so distant future they're also 16 smaller than the mtw-2 and come in three color options i have the graphite color here which i think is pretty slick but you can also pick them up in black or white there are links to all the products mentioned in this video in the description below the design has changed the mtw and mtw2 had a more rounded look and these are more rectangularly shaped and share some of the same design elements as the septon cx true wireless and cx2 wireless plus buds the sennheiser released at more affordable price points last year the charging case looks similar to this mtw-2's case but it is a bit more compact it does offer wireless charging for those who want that feature the other big design change is the addition of a rubberized fin to help keep the buzz in your ears more securely it's not a big wing like you'll find on sennheiser's new sport true wireless earbuds or the beats fit pro it's more subtle kind of a bump or ridge i started with the default medium-sized fin then moved on to the large fin the bud stayed my ears fine with both sizes but i got a little more secure fit with the largest fin and used that when i was running and had no problem keeping the buds in my ears they're ipx4 water resistant so they're splash proof and survive just fine after i left them out in the rain for 15 minutes needless to say you'll have to play around with the fins and tips to see what combination gets you the most comfortable fit with the tightest seal but by making the buds a little smaller they should fit a wider spectrum of ears and while i can't tell you if they'll be a perfect fit for your ears particularly if you have really small ears i do like what sennheiser has done with their design and they are more compact than the cx true wireless buzz and the sony wf-1000x mark 4 buds in fact for those of you who found that the otherwise excellent sony's cause some discomfort these might be a good alternative i'll get into how they sound and perform in a minute but first i'm going to give you a quick rundown of their key features as noted they have active noise cancelling it's the adaptive variety you can't adjust the levels and there's also a transparency mode that's an awareness note that lets sound in it sounds pretty natural but it isn't quite as natural sounding as what you get with the transparency mode on the airpods pro you give a quick tap on the left butt to toggle between noise cancelling and transparency the buds do have touch controls and they are quite responsive there's also an anti-wind mode that's part of the noise canceling settings however as far as i can tell you have to access that through the app along with the equalizer settings you can customize the touch controls a bit and it's worth mentioning the tap and hold gesture allows you to adjust volume up and down on the buds themselves also you can use either bud solo left to right and leave one charging in the case if you want additionally these have ear detection sensors so if you remove a bud from your ear your music pauses and it resumes when you put it back in you can also have the butts shut down automatically after set time interval if you leave them out of their case that helps preserve battery life which is fairly decent at around seven hours at moderate buying levels that's the same numbers what you got from the mtw twos battery so no changes there these use bluetooth 5.2 alas at launch anyway they don't have multi-point bluetooth pairing which will allow you to pair the buds with two devices at the same time say a computer and your smartphone but i was told that the feature will be added with a firmware upgrade in the future that means that the chipset supports multi-point bluetooth pairing but the engineers are still working on the software to enable and make it work reliably that can be tricky with true wireless earbuds the budsport both the aac and aptx adaptive audio codecs many android phones support aptx and with the right setup going with aptx for bluetooth streaming may improve audio quality slightly that said i didn't notice a major difference going back and forth between an iphone 13 pro and a couple of android phones using the qobuz streaming service that does offer higher resolution streaming over aptx adaptive so how exactly do these sound well slightly better than the previous model which was one of the best sounding true wireless earbuds when it was released in 2020 while this new version has seemingly similar seven millimeter drivers the buds sounded slightly clearer and more accurate to my ears and also played slightly louder out of the box these have a slightly more balanced audiophile sound profile compared to the sony wf-1000x4 which have a little more energy in the base and are slightly warmer both have a pretty wide sound stage with relatively open big sound the sennheisers offer a bit more clarity and i end up using the soundcheck feature in the app to come up with a custom preset equalizer setting based on my listening tastes my sound profile ended up looking a little bit like the popular happy face profile with the bass and treble boosted a bit and the mids tone down a tad with that profile the earbuds sounded a little more like the sony's the bass came across as powerful yet well-defined the long and short of it is the mtw3 are totally really pleasant to listen to with smooth yet lively sound and nice detail they work well with a variety of music genres and i didn't experience any listening fatigue even over longer listening sessions i'll finish by talking about the noise cancelling and voice calling performance sennheiser has made some improvements with the noise cancelling and from my test standing in front of a noisy hvac unit in my apartment the noise cancelling appears to be right there with sonys and boses how well the noise cancelling muffles sound does depend on how tight a seal you get with the included ear tips but sennheiser does appear to have upped his game in the noise canceling department the same is true for voice calls these have three microphones on each butt and caller said they did a decent job reducing background noise when i was talking to them from the noisy streets of new york city there's a little bit of a white noise generated but they said they could hear my voice clearly when i spoke so voice calling performance has improved significantly from the previous model yeah so there's a lot of cars going by a fire truck just went by i don't know if you can hear my voice clearly yes i'm not really hearing very many um noises in the background i do hear a little bit of kind of a static or white noise but i feel like the the buds are doing a decent job of blocking out that distant noise still hear a couple of people chatting but um overall not too bad all in all except for the lack of multi-point bluetooth pairing at launch i don't really have anything major to complain about i don't think you get a huge bump in sound quality from the cx-2 wireless plus buds that cost less but the mtw3's design is sleeker and more compact and should fit more ears comfortably these buds also work better as a headset for making calls and the noise canceling is seemingly superior as i said they're pretty pricey but they're an excellent set of earbuds for both ios and android users it will hopefully improve a bit with firmware upgrades i do think they face a lot of competition there are now several premium buzz in this price range including the 200 beats fit pro that sound impressive and perform well and we could get new airpods pro with upgraded sound later this year but as of this moment they're definitely among my favorite new earbuds and are worthy of strong consideration especially if you see their price tip a bit but let me know what you think sound off in the comment section and if you found this video informative

16,8n2RRK6JhCA,Apple has MORE competition! - Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 Earbuds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n2RRK6JhCA,ShortCircuit," - This is one of the most generic looking boxes I've ever seen, look at it compared to the Momentum True Wireless 2s. It's almost the exact same. If these were on the shelf beside each other, you could easily grab the wrong one. What we wanna talk about is the Momentum True Wireless 3 from Sennheiser. Are they even Sennheiser anymore? Turn great sound into your sound. We'll talk about why they wrote that later. Oh, look at, they got the German right there, (speaks foreign language) Here's the actual charging case. It has a fabric look, kinda like the cases that Google was making for their pixel phones for a while there. And inside, ah, there it is. There's the earphones. Inside the box, looks like we were gonna get some ear tips. And what is this? Might just have to, ugh. (laughs). This looks like they go around the earphone on the outside. We'll try those in a bit. They're like wing tips to go into your, what is that called? Pinna, concha. I think that's a swear word in Spanish. Okay, here we go, a USB A to C Cable for charging that plugs into the front of the charge case. This also can charge wirelessly. They say seven hours on the earbuds themselves, which can be extended to a total of 28, so an extra 21 hours with the charging case. French. (paper thuds) Plug this in for 30 seconds. What is this trying to say? I'm not doing it anyway. I'm a hardheaded man-child. Tips, none of these are foam, they're all silicone. There's three sizes, extra small, small and large. Screw you if you're medium. - [Jono] No, I think there's medium installed. (speaking foreign language) - Let's get a look at them. Maybe I'll open up the box from the 2s so we can see how they're different. But first I wanna try putting this little ring on this side. Okay, it does come with one already. And so you can see there's this little bulge in it. Can you see that? Right there, there's a little bulge. And then this one's bulgeless. This one's, little bulge here. So that's just gonna extend further and further into your concha. I usually just keep the stock ones on. You know what I should do though, is I should probably put a different size on each one, because I feel like I always have a different fit on my left ear. All right, let's see what the 2s look like. Very similar case. Although I would say this new case... Ah, the new case is definitely smaller. It's like a millimeter or less taller, maybe a centimeter shorter, and the width seems the same. How many bananas diff... Oh my goodness. - [Jono] (laughs) Oh no, banana down! - So yeah, the case is definitely way more compact now. Just look at all the dead space they had between earphones before. So that's a nice improvement. And then they, for some reason, changed the position of the port. On the earphones, oh man, I don't wanna mix up who's who here. (both laughing) So they were a little shinier, brighter before. Now, these do come in three colors, there's basic black, white and graphite. I'm assuming this is graphite, but they're less silvery. They're still very shiny. I can see that there are three mics on this thing. There's one on the inside, and then there's two external ones. I'm gonna put on one of each and you guys can tell me which ones better. What do you think? Huh or nah? - [Jono] That one - Looks better? - [Jono] Yeah, definitely. - Hell yeah, that's what you want. The new one's the good one, cool. Get this crap out of my face. All right, let's practice with my phone and check with the app. I hate when apps have little flaws like this at the beginning. Just let me in. I'll allow the permissions this one time. No device found, so clearly I need to do something to start pairing them. There's no button in here, which is actually my preference. I like when there's a pairing button in the case. I find that's more intuitive than... ""Touch and hold both ear buds ""for three seconds and start Bluetooth pairing."" Put 'em both in, touch and hold both. I hear nothing. I think I need to wake 'em up. I think I need to do this. I need a power source. Can I get a battery bank please? Pairing, cool. Let's get back in the action. Pairing successful, with a slight British accent, nice. It's weird that it has to look for the device when it's already connected to my phone. There we go. Okay, cool little interface here. Connections, just the Pixel 4. ""The Momentum True Wireless so you can connect to, ""can only connect to one device at once."" Okay, so this whole... There's no reason for this page to exist. Oh, firmware update. ""The update will take 21 minutes!"" All right, I'll do this damn firmware update, 'cause that gives me a great opportunity to talk about iSponsor, Joby. Joby is known for the unique GorillaPod, but they now have a brand new lineup of creator focused audio gear. There's the Wavo PRO a flagship on camera shotgun microphone with active noise reduction the Wavo POD, a podcast or gaming microphone ready to plug and play with USBC, the Wavo AIR a high quality wireless mic kit that's modular and designed for the creator on the go, and the Wavo Lav PRO an ultra small lavalier microphone that pairs perfectly with the Wavo PRO. So take your content creation to the next level with Joby, using the link below. Wow, that update took a long time but we're back and we're into the app. Let's check out the equalizer options we start with here. So it ships with it all flat, which is cool. You can adjust the base mid and travel. And what are the steps kind of one DB steps up to plus or minus six DB. I'm gonna leave it flat for now. I doesn't look like there's any presets you can just save and name. Let's call this one too. Your own. Oh, there are pre other ones too. There's rock, pop, dance, hip hop, classical movie. And then my custom ones are down there. All right. All I'm gonna keep it like that. 'Cause that's the best way to evaluate something like this right off the bat. There's also base boost special EQ preset for more intense base. Podcast mode special EQ preset for enhanced speech clarity. So that's just gonna boost up the frequency range where the human voices. What, this thing just spoke to me. It said volume max. And I don't know why. I guess I tapped on it. That's gonna bring us to what the interface is like which I am excited to hear about. Transparency mode is off, adaptive noise cancellation off for now. Let's play some tunes. This is loud enough for me already at 60%. So that's a good sign. Yeah, max is pretty loud, it's not super loud, but it's pretty loud. (fingers snaping) I can't really hear my snapping right now. Let's see what happens when I turn on the active noise cancellation (Jono lapping) didn't really seem to change much. All right. Now I'm gonna turn that off. Keep lapping. Okay, no real change. But what I don't understand is am I turning off adaptive noise cancellation or am I turning off all active noise canceling. - [Jono] Oh right. And I don't know. They do sound a little bright but not really that impressed, honestly. I wanna do the hearing test now and see if the EQ that this app shoots out for me makes these songs that I love sound better. Oh, I need an account. I gotta play my own tracks. Oh, weird. Select the option that sounds best for you. I honestly cannot tell like, if you were pressing the button and I wasn't looking, I wouldn't even know you pressed the button. (Jono laughing) This is not what I was expecting for this flow. Oh wait, I can tell the difference on this. A and B are similar, but C is like way different. It's like this one guitar is getting put under water when I hit C. I think I like B. All right. It just boosted the crap out of the trouble. But the trouble was the thing I thought was too bright at the beginning, too harsh. So now like, I'm gonna save this. I'm on that preset now, I'm gonna go back to the song. I was playing a few minutes ago and see if I still think it's too harsh. I don't know. Am I just used to it now? This isn't a review, whatever. Let's see what the features are. Tap on the right, pause. Tap on the left did not unpause. Oh, that's transparency mode. Hey, what's up guys. - [Jono] Hey. - Hello. Can you hear me now? (Jono laughing) - Good. - [Jono] Banana phone. And now do, do, do, do do it's either A and C or not. Also what the hell's going on. Sometimes it's playing and changing transparency mode. Why is the music playing and pausing? Is there two functions bound to this one button? What kind of... I guess I'm just turning transparency on and off. And when you're on transparency, mode pauses 'cause you're trying to listen to somebody and then you put it back to A and C and it thinks, well you probably wanna also play music. Then I can pause it over here and A and C is still on. Okay, so it's making an assumption there. They made a design decision there, I guess it's defensible. Double tap. Next song. Triple tap. I gotta say, oh, what the hell? Google assistant on triple tap. Get outta here. I have to say the hapics are good every time I tap it seems to register a tap. There's also these little feedback sounds when I triple tap it goes, it doesn't just go. poo, poo, poo, it goes poo, poo, poo. Like the second and third hits have different sounds. Okay, so how do I go back a song? Is it double tap on the left? Yes, what if I triple tap this one? It goes poodook, but I'm not talking. I don't know what that is. I'm gonna look in the app, it'll tell me. Also, is there a long press volume max? Okay, so you hold and it goes ramps down. Can you see that on here? That's really weird. It's like the headphone has its own volume range that's decoupled from the phone. 'Cause I'm not seeing the volume meter go up and down here. And when I turn this up to follow your max, I'm still here. So it's like you have two volume knobs to adjust. It's like on your TV, you might have a stereo and you set your knob and you just leave that knob, and then you use your TV remote to like turn up and down. Might get annoying in the headphones. Kind of use case though. Touch control. Or you can just say able to touch controls completely too. That's that's gonna be handy. All right. So you get left and right. 1, 2, 3 taps and a hold. Sometimes what you see in these apps is with a certain interaction, like say one tap you only are allowed certain actions. You can't just do all the actions coupled with any of the interactions they limit you for some like artificial reason which is super annoying, here with one tap. I get a lot of options. It looks like I'm not limited in any way. You can make anything go from no function, plane, pause, next track, previous track the voice assistant and that's what this is bound to. And that's why it's highlighted volume up and down power on and off. So the triple tap is noise installation and the single tap is transparency mode. So that's what it was when it was going do-do but I couldn't tell I'm really impressed with the interface here. Can we get that fan going? I'm gonna try some, A and C on and off and I'm gonna try this wind anti-wind mode. I can feel this. I can barely hear it. It doesn't seem to be affecting the sound of the sound of music, but let's do a call. Hey, what's up buddy? I'm just doing a test call on short circuit. Really, I sound terrible. I have a fan pointed at me and I have the anti-wind feature on. I'm gonna turn it off and you tell me if I sound even more terrible, right? I'm gonna say one consistent note and then you tell me if it's how it gets better. - I'm gonna go. (hauling) Did it get better or worse throughout that, you couldn't tell. Okay, all right, thanks. I'm satisfied with that. See you later. Cold ended. I really like the voice. Oh, transparency mode with music. So I think that's the toggle. So what was the command before? It was single tap. Okay, so if I hit that off with music. We got there guys, we figured it out. Closed the loop on that one. It's a setting. Well, okay, it's cool. You seem to get a lot of settings with this. Oh man, I have such disgusting wet ear wax especially on the left, like the right's okay. But danm! Sound zones allow you to automatically apply your sound settings when entering or leaving a sound zone. That's dope actually, 'cause you could be like, all right, whenever I walk into this part of the office, I want transparency on. Like if I leave my desk, I want transparency on. If I walk into the gym, I want A and C on. Or if I walk into my home I want the volume maxed. (both laugh) Get away from me. Continue without our location permissions. Oh, whoa, sweet, okay. So I just zoom in. You can only go down to a hundred meters. Okay, you're definitely not doing rooms in your house and maybe if you have a big office this'll work, but okay. So the actions when entering the noise zone, noise control is the term for active noise canceling or transparency are off. You can choose a different EQ. That's kind of interesting. It's like pretty basic, but it's pretty cool. Great excuse to give away your location data. There are pretty good headphone the sound didn't blow me away. But one thing that's really nice is that somehow throwout a global pandemic, a chip shortage inflation hitting record numbers. These went down in price 50 bucks. The first and second models of this headphone were $300 Us dollars. Now they're 250, that's crazy. Were they making too much money before they just had an acquisition or they got sold? So maybe they got some synergies, I don't know, but they cut the price. They're competing in a different bracket now. I guess they're the same price as their pros pros. Now this case is definitely bigger and lamer or I'd like the experience of them a lot more than the sound necessarily but the sound is definitely good enough. This is my new rating system actually. I'm not giving recommendations or don't buy I'm not giving ratings outta 10, like we do on they're just movies, the movie podcast that you should subscribe. Instead I'm giving facial expressions.

17,2Oo3d4FdK9U,(1 Year of HEAVY USE) Sennheiser Momentum TWS 3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oo3d4FdK9U,Picky Audio, hey everyone it's been just over a year since my momentum three review and since then I've used these earbuds a lot so today we're going to be going through all the nitty-gritty details The Good The Bad what I'd like to see improved for the momentum for and if they're still worth buying today because they have been updated a lot through firmware in the last year now keep in mind going off previous Sennheiser true Wireless releases they're releasing new bud every two years it's only been a year so we probably won't see a momentum before for another year but now let's get into it the reason I've used these earbuds so much is because these are my go-to training earbud and I usually train four days a week for two hours so do the math there that's a lot of hours of Total use I've also dropped the case and the earbuds countless times I'm a very clumsy person the earbuds have been covered in sweat and chalk and you can tell by looking at them they've got some marks on them they've been used quite a bit apart from that they're completely fine now usually I choose a training earbud mainly based off how well the blood steamer is but that's something a case for the momentums they do fit me quite well there's no way they're going to fall out but I do find myself having to readjust quite a bit throughout my sessions I use the second largest ear tip and the largest wing tip I do have pretty large ears so the wingtip doesn't really do too much for me it would be nice to see some larger wing tips on the next version getting a good seal with the ear tips is also a bit tricky but with practice I have found it a lot easier for me I just need to take the earbuds in and out a couple of times until I feel an even seal this is only a slight annoyance and honestly something I have gotten used to but most earbuds that I test don't really have this issue there are plenty of other earbuds out there that give me an easy seal and better security such as the airpods Pro 2 nothing E2 JBL live Pro 2 and there's plenty more and every earbud that I review I test thoroughly in the gym but I keep finding myself going back to the momentum three for their Dynamic sound quality they just can't be beaten when you want a nice full Dynamic Sound and I will talk about the sound a little bit later or you to skip to it there are timestamps down there for your ease but back to the fit I did mention I use these when training and that is mainly when weight training doing some static cardio or walking these are not a bud I would recommend when running since a lot of body-borne noise is created I hear my own breathing quite a lot as well as the footsteps I make on the ground they're quite loud and this takes away from the sound it mainly takes away from the bass and when running you probably want to use a transparency mode to hear your surroundings the issue there is that the microphones pick up a lot of wind noise and it's just kind of annoying running with transparency mode on so I wouldn't recommend these when running some of my go-to earbuds when running at the airpods Pro 2 airpods three because they don't have an ear tip JBL live Pro 2 are also quite good and the Sennheiser sport are also a decent one they're actually designed for sports and running in mind they don't sound as good as a momentum three they do come pretty close but they fix the body-borne noise issues that the momentum 3 have check out the video up here for a detailed comparison between the sport and the momentums now let's talk about the battery life and mainly how well the battery is held up in the last year and it's just the harsh truth that battery issues battery drain issues are quite common even with premium earbuds talking bows Sony Apple I've had issues with my airpods Pro 2. had to get a new case and I have seen some comments of people's issues with the momentum three luckily for me I've had no issues at all from day one the battery life was incredibly solid I did get over eight hours at 70 volume with noise canceling on in my test and here's what I got in my test at 70 volume today so you can see how it Compares and the total battery life with the case and the earbuds is 28 hours so I find it only really have to charge the earbuds every three to four weeks so still great battery life today but let me know in the comments your experience with sennheiser's earbuds one clear issue with the case though is still its size for today's standards it's just a bit too chunky the total battery life is great and for me personally the size doesn't really matter since I just leave it in my gym bag but the size of it definitely holds me back from chucking it in my pocket this is where I'll just go for my airpods Pro 2 instead but I still love the design of the case and I just chucked this thing in my bag throw that bag around usually I have like five other earbuds I'm testing at the time in there and a whole bunch of random things which really does test the durability of the case and how easily it gets scratched and you can see my case still looks great today the durability is very solid now let's talk about controls this is where the nitpicks start to come in because the controls work great you can control everything including volume up and down you can customize almost everything I say almost everything since you can only add volume control on the long hold on the left and right earbud also transparency and noise canceling are separate functions so you need to set either one to a different control rather than having it all on like the single tap for example I also find it pretty frustrating when turning transparency mode on because you don't get any beep feedback to know whether or not you've actually turned it on or off this is mainly an issue if music is playing because you can't hear the transparency mode but if you have music paused then of course you can easily hear the transparency mode turn on unless you're in a quiet environment and it's just a little strange because the noise canceling gives you a different beat feedback whether it's on or off so I don't know why it's not on the transparency mode another issue with the transparency mode is related to the any detection that the earbuds use to automatically pause and play your music so when you have transparency mode on and you take one or both earbuds out of your ear transparency mode will turn off so if you put the earbuds back in your ear transparency mode will stay turned off so you manually have to turn it back on again I honestly don't know why this happens because we're noise canceling on if you take your earbuds out noise canceling stays on put them back in your ears noise canceling is still on a small thing but it's pretty annoying there's also no mute button when you're on a phone call another small thing but we can start to see a few small things start to stack up and I feel like they can all easily be fixed because like I said Sennheiser have updated their earbuds quite a bit over the last year and that shows with connectivity so there have been two big updates the first one is the addition of multi-point connection so that came out about six months ago which allows you to connect two devices to the earbuds at the same time and in my testing it works really well all you need to do is just pause media on one device before you resume it on your other device and I've tested it on my iPhone 12 Pro Samsung Galaxy s10e and my MacBook Pro M1 the only issue with it is whenever I open it up in the app to change the settings the app just crashes and that's always happened but I don't really have to adjust the settings but if you want to on an iPhone it doesn't work for me now the second big update is the addition of high-res audio because these earbuds use aptx adaptive which is actually high-res audio capable now what does that mean well it's very similar to what you get with ldac high resolution audio codec and there was nothing too clear online to say whether ldac is better than aptx adaptive even though the total kilobits per second on ldac is almost double what you get on aptx adaptive but then it's not just about how big the number is but anyway all the earbuds that have El Zac are always tested to see how much better the quality improves normally it's a couple of percent if you don't use high quality streaming if you use high quality streaming you get another couple of percent above that now I don't have a phone compatible with appdx adaptive but CEO in the making did a video on the high-res audio update he kind of explained it similar to what I noticed with ldoc a very subtle Improvement a couple of percent in audio quality so I feel like it's pretty close not a massive feature but if you use an updex Adaptive phone it's there if you need now call Quality is usually a feature on a lot of earbuds that do get updated over time so what I'm going to do now is is compare my audio recording from my original review to the latest firmware of what it sounds like today it's not going to be exactly in the same setting but I'll try and get it as close as possible alright so here we are in the outside world with the Sennheiser momentum 3 through wireless earbuds alright so here we are with the Sennheiser momentum three two RC mods all right and here's the core quality of generation three so hopefully you can hear my voice well and all the noise around me is getting blocked out all right if you're enjoying the video as usual please Chuck a like down there because it does help the video out now we're going to talk about noise canceling this is where the niggles kind of continue and some of them drive me a little bit crazy at times first the noise canceling is great here's my overall noise canceling ranking with all the earbuds that I have tested you can see Sunny is in the top five it's not the best noise canceling out there but it is very very solid the only issue with it is how easily the microphones pick up wind noise when you do have noise canceling on to the point where sometimes I'll just go for a walk outside it doesn't even have to be very windy it's just like me walking slowly creates a bit of wind and the microphones pick it up and if it is a windy day I can be listening above 60 70 volume and the wind is still very audible there is a wind noise reduction mode in the app which you can turn on manually and this completely cuts out the microphones picking up the wind noise but do keep in mind this is going to reduce your noise canceling strength by just over half so if I'm outside sometimes I just fine turning noise canceling off completely is the best way to go because the transparency mode like I said before it also does the exact same thing it picks up wind incredibly easily and of course this is inevitable with any True Value that has noise canceling and a transparency mode but the momentum three are up there with the worst that I've tested and looking at the design of the earbuds and where the microphones are placed it kind of makes sense why this does happen because a microphone is kind of on the bottom corner of the earbud there that microphone is facing straight ahead of whatever way you're going to be walking so when the wind hits it's going straight into the microphones those mics are picking it all up incredibly easily so I'm really hoping Sennheiser sourced this out with their next release also the transparency mode itself needs some improvement it's not too bad it's pretty natural but there is a lot of white noise here when using the transparency mode in a more quiet environment and you can adjust the strength in the up but anything above 50 which is what it's on by default there's just way too much white noise even at the default setting a decent amount of white noise if you tone it down it reduces but then it's pretty hard to hear things to the point even with earbuds in I could have a conversation with someone but if it's a slightly noisy environment with a bit of noise going on around I find just taking the earbuds out is a bit easier we repair like the airpods Pro 2 I can happily wear those if I'm talking to someone now throughout the whole video you've probably noticed these buds have a lot of little flaws but despite all the flaws what keeps me coming back to these earbuds is their sound quality it isn't the most balanced the cleanest or most well refined tuning out there but it does have the most dynamic and versatile sound out of any earbud I've ever tested now what do I mean by Dynamic and versatile and the reason I explain it like this is because of the amount of Freedom you get to customize the sound to your liking whether you want a nice balanced and clean sound or an over-the-top bass boosted sound because without customizing the sound at all right out of the box they sound pretty decent it is a balanced tuning but with nice deep sub Bass nice crisp trouble and a smooth mid-range but to be honest if you're looking for a more balanced tuning you're better off going for a pair like the airpods Pro 2 or the nothing E2 but if you're like me you want a little extra thump in the low end but want to retain as much clarity as possible the momentum 3 are my number one bud and if you're also looking for a Bud where you can just push the base at times to some over-the-top bass boosted subwoofer levels the momentum 3 are also number one when it comes to this so if I'm in the mood just to really intricately listen to my music I think they sound the best with no EQ customization on most of the time when using the earbuds mainly when training of course I do a subtle bass boost in the sub bass and the mid bass and a little boost in the treble and I have this on most of the time and I find that this brings out a little bit of extra bass it keeps the crisp trouble it does dial down the mids ever so slightly which I don't mind but they just work with all kind of genres with that tuning on and then if I'm feeling really crazy I Chuck on the bass boost EQ along with this bass boost EQ and that's what I'm going to use if I'm going for like a really heavy lift and I'll just need to crank some hard Style some nice bass Heavy Music and the buzz has become a little bit over the top boomy and they're great for that and if I want to take it even further this is my ultimate base EQ where I bring the mids down heaps and it's really just bass and treble and this does sound pretty crazy but it's more of a fun thing to play around with and you can really push the bass to levels where most earbuds I've tested will start to distort sound pretty weird but the momentum still sound okay when you're pushing out this much bass now I also need to add what the recent firmware update has done to the sound quality I wasn't going to add this in the video I kind of played around with it and I didn't think it was that good I tried it again and it's pretty game changing so this is firmware 2.12.33 and this now gives you even more sound customization first is the extra bands in the EQ so now you get five bands compared to three so this gives you more freedom to play around with the mid bass and the upper mid-range but out of all the updates I've talked about here today that's not the massive change obviously it's going to be with the sound personalization so you just go in the up down to the my sound section then choose sound personalization and this feature can drastically change how the buds sound well past how you can tailor them with the five band EQ and a lot of buds that have sound personalization nowadays most of them do and this is definitely the strangest that I've tried as you run through the test you kind of just adjust the volume of certain instruments then you get your tailored sound and once I ran through the test and adjusted all the volumes to what I thought was best it didn't really change the sound too much which is why I dismissed this feature in the first place it's not until you fine-tune the sound where you can really start to get these sounding good and they should really explain in the app how this works but roughly the further to the right you go this is going to increase treble the further to the left this will increase the mids higher up is less bass and lower down is more bass so for me I like leaving the dot here close to the bottom right corner and with it there it increases the bass increases the mids and treble creates a much more direct sound to the point where I couldn't really recreate it in the EQ and also fun it increases the Sound Stage slightly as well as opening up the base so the bass doesn't really sound too centered it becomes a bit wider as well now I tried to play around with the EQ but I just couldn't match what the sound personalization did here because in the regular 5 band EQ you can push out some decent bass but it's very challenging to increase the treble to the point where the sound personalization does if you start increasing the trouble even the mids the bass automatically starts to decrease where with the sound personalization you get that nice full bass but the treble and mids don't fall behind somehow it's pretty insane and when I was filming some footage for this video I just did a quick screen recording I just did some random volumes in the test I actually think it sounded the best when I did that so if you want to copy that it's playing right now you can just look back copy that exactly and see if it sounds good for you but again I feel like they've got some algorithm going on so it does work with the kind of sound that you like to hear the only issue with it is that you can't EQ the buds further when you have the sound personalization saved and when you are doing the fine tuning you can't play your own music it's just the one default song that plays so it is kind of hard to hear the changes that you are making until you go back into your own song and you kind of you'll probably notice you might have to go back and forth a little bit but still this is definitely worth playing around with especially if you're a bit of a bass head like me and you want to get as much clarity as possible the momentum three were already the best at this with this sound personalization it just takes it to new levels so that's Dynamic and versatile if you want the buzz to sound balanced you're all good slightly bass boosted great over the top bass boosted Sandy's got your back and you get all this Freedom better than any earbud I've tested and that's why despite all the flaws I keep coming back to these earbuds and why I still think these are 100 worth it today if it's a dynamic and versatile sound you're looking for as long as the flaws don't freak you out but I've mentioned them but now if you want to see how the momentum 3 stack up against the best true wireless earbuds check out this video here where I compared scored and ranked the top six earbuds so check that out in the meantime stay key I'll see you in the next one bye now,Sennheiser MTW3,The momentum three earbuds are my go-to training earbud and I usually train four days a week for two hours.I use the second largest ear tip and the largest wing tip I do have pretty large ears so the wingtip doesn't really do too much for me.The microphones pick up a lot of wind noise and it's just kind of annoying running with transparency mode on. The controls work great you can control everything including volume up and down.There have been two big updates the first one is the addition of multi-point connection.The only issue with it is whenever I open it up in the app to change the settings the app just crashes. Sunny is in the top five it's not the best noise canceling out there but it is very very solid.The momentum 3 are also number one when it comes to this.Despite all the flaws what keeps me coming back to these earbuds is their sound quality. This is my ultimate base EQ where I bring the mids down heaps and it's really just bass and treble.The momentum 3 were already the best at this with this sound personalization it just takes it to new levels.Despite all the flaws I still think these are 100 worth it today if it's a dynamic and versatile sound you're looking for.
20,1qQ4a6Kzra4,Bose Quiet Comfort II Earbuds Review - 6 Months Later,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qQ4a6Kzra4,6 Months Later," The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are a  frustrating product. They have a great,   comfortable design and some of the best noise  cancellation I've ever experienced in a set   of earbuds. Unfortunately, though, they do  come with quite a few downsides. But first,   let's talk about the good things about these buds. These buds are extremely comfortable. Bose gives  you a bunch of what they call stability bands to   place around the earbuds. This allows you  to get the most comfortable and stable fit.   There's a bit of a learning curve to getting them  placed correctly on the buds. But once you figure   it out and put them in your ears, you'll  likely find them to be quite comfortable. Now, before switching to these buds for  six months, the buds I had been wearing   were the Sony WF-1000XM4s, which I've  also reviewed. And in terms of comfort,   especially when you're wearing buds for hours on  end, I found that the Bose buds are considerably   more comfortable. The Bose buds go less  deep into your ear than the Sony ones. I can wear these Bose buds for hours on end.  When I do, I find that they sound pretty good.   They're not as good as the Sony WF-1000XM4s,  but I think you get a little bit more detail   in the music you listen to. And when I first  got these, I did think their bass was a bit   much. But thankfully, they give you an EQ  setting in the Bose app to make adjustments. With my adjustments, I was able to more  closely match the sound profile I'm used   to with my Sony buds. Now, part of what makes  any modern-day buds sound good to me is noise   cancellation. It's canceling out all of the  ambient noise around you, allowing you to hear   a wider range of frequencies that aren't  being drowned out by some external noise. And let me tell you, if you want the best noise  cancellation, put in a set of buds today. I   think these buds are probably it. Their noise  cancellation is very impressive. Especially if   you just go out for a walk in a city where there's  a lot of noise, it just cuts everything out. Unfortunately, there are some annoyances that  I've found with these buds. During exercise,   I'll find my buds will rotate slightly, just  enough for them to let in more outside noise.   So every once in a while, I have to rotate them  back in, so they slide a little bit more into my   ears. I know that when they're in there a little  bit more, the noise cancellation gets better. Now, this could just be because I picked the wrong  stability bands for these buds. But these were the   ones that seemed like they would fit the best.  Now, another annoyance I've found with the noise   cancellation on these buds is that they don't  do a great job of masking either high-pitched   noises or just really loud noises. Especially when  I'm doing something like pounding out chicken. I've got to take these buds out because  they'll just let in this clipping noise   or something every time the mallet hits  the chicken. And this is not something   I've experienced with other audio devices  like the AirPods Max or my Sony WF-1000XM4   buds. Another thing that's pretty good  with these buds is transparency mode. I've actually got it enabled  right now, and overall,   my voice sounds clear. I think this is  one of the better transparency modes. It sounds a little distant, and it doesn't  sound like I'm wearing earbuds. The AirPods Max   still have the best transparency mode, where it  doesn't even sound like you're wearing headphones. Another great feature of these buds  is their touch controls. Overall,   they've worked great. They not only  let you play, pause, skip forward,   and skip back like you would expect with a pair  of earbuds, but they also let you adjust their   volume by just swiping up and swiping down,  which is a rarity in the world of earbuds. Another standout feature that Bose did a good job  with is the setup experience with the Bose app.   Bose gives you clear instructions with animations  to walk you through the product. Apart from the   initial setup and the EQ adjustments, I don't  really go into the Bose app all that often,   except for making sure that the firmware on the  buds has been updated and troubleshooting issues. Next, let's talk about battery life. Overall,  it's been great. The buds are rated for six   hours of playback on a charge, and the case holds  a further four charges, for a total of 24 hours   of playback. Just 20 minutes of charging  will net you up to two hours of playback. So that's everything I've liked about  these buds over the past six months. Now, let's talk about downsides.  Unfortunately, with these buds,   there are quite a few. I guess that is the benefit  of having a six-month review period. And if you   like the fact that we do reviews only after six  months, make sure you subscribe to the channel. The first and most annoying downside I've  run into with these buds is that sometimes   they'll just refuse to connect to my phone.  To remedy this issue, I'll have to go back   into the Bluetooth settings on my iPhone, or in  the Bose app, and manually connect to the buds. Another annoying issue I've run into  with these buds are audio cutouts. This   typically happens when I'm out on a walk  and I've got my phone in my pants pocket   with the case in my other pocket. I'll just  get cutouts with whatever I'm listening to. Another annoyance I've had with  these buds is that when I first   put them in and I'm getting ready  to listen to a podcast or something,   I'm unable to trigger it by just long pressing  the left earbud. The only way I've been able   to solve this issue is to take the buds  back out and then put them back in again. Another downside I've encountered  is that when I'm wearing the buds   and pick up a call on my phone, my  iPhone won't automatically switch   the call over to my buds. I have to  do it manually almost every time,   which is incredibly annoying. And it's something  I haven't experienced as much with other buds. Another downside I've found with the buds is  the microphone quality. It's just okay. Here's a   comparison of the microphone quality of the  Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (QC2s) to the standard   second-generation AirPods, the Sony WF-1000XM4,  the Pixel Buds Pro, and the Galaxy Buds Pro. As you can hear, the microphone quality of the   QC2s is just okay. It's not terrible, but  it's not great either. I get the feedback   that people can't hear me very well, especially  when there's traffic or other background noise. Oddly, Bose doesn't seem to use the tips  of these earbuds for microphone placement,   like Apple does with their iconic stem design. I  think this is certainly an odd choice. Typically,   the closer you can get a microphone to somebody's  mouth, the better the overall vocal quality is   going to be. So I'm not exactly sure why Bose  didn't take advantage of that in their design. Now, before we get to recommendations,  there are a few more slides. One downside I need to cover first is the case.  It's a bit big for my taste, and I think Bose   could do some work here to try and slim it down  for their next-gen buds. Also, the case doesn't   support wireless charging, which for buds that  cost close to $300 USD is a bit of a letdown. Given the high cost of these buds and the amount  of downsides and issues I've had with them over   the past six months, unfortunately, I just  can't recommend spending the money on them. which really sucks because the noise cancellation  solution on these is pretty much best in class. I'll continue to check in on these buds  after this review. If anything changes,   I'll leave that in a review follow-up in  our free monthly newsletter, and if you   haven't done so already, I'll leave a link to  sign up for it in the description below. If   you're in the market for a premium set of true  wireless earbuds, Sony is rumored to be coming   out with their next generation of earbuds  that will be comparable to this Bose set. And from the leaks I've seen, they should improve  on their comfort. Or if you're an Apple user,   of course, looking at the AirPods Pro  makes sense. And right now you can get   these Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds on sale for a  hundred dollars off at the time of recording,   which I pointed out in our free monthly newsletter  where I'll sometimes post deal alerts as well.

21,3Q4ni8AXw4A,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 Review: Noise-Canceling King,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q4ni8AXw4A,CNET, hey folks these are the bose quietcomfort earbuds too in case you missed it they were announced on the same day that apple introduced the airpods pro 2 and iphone 14 and they kind of got a bit lost in the shuffle they cost 299 so definitely pricey but now that i got my hands on a pair i got to say they're really good they fit my ears really well have great noise cancelling excellent sound and improved voice calling performance we can debate at the end whether they're too expensive but before we do that let me go over what i think makes them among the top few earbuds and what i think some people may find a little lacking here we go [Music] okay so for starters you can only get them in black at launch triple black is what bose calls the color but to you and me it's black sandstone is coming later in the year personally i like the lighter color a little better but black's just fine and a lot of people prefer it more importantly not only are the earbuds about 30 smaller than their predecessors but their case is about 40 smaller and truly pocketable while the original quietcomfort earbuds featured excellent noise canceling and very good sound quality they were pretty hefty and protruded from your ears the new buds each weigh a little less than .25 ounces or seven grams according to bows still not spelt but significantly smaller the other big changes to the ear tips bose has ditched its one piece state ear wing tips for a two-piece fit kit system that features separate ear tips and stability bands in three different size options that's supposed to give users more flexibility to get a secure fit and tight seal i did like the state ear wing tips but after trying the new two-piece system i'm sold on it i ended up going with the large tips in medium stability band and that really locked the buds in my ears i can't tell you that these will fit everyone's ears equally well if you're someone who can't get a secure fit with the air pods pro 2 which are lighter and quite comfortable wear this new two-piece fit kit system may be a reason to give the bose a go over the new airpods pro a handful of new premium earbuds feature a kind of auto custom tube feature that takes into account the shape of your ears and ear canal and bose has also developed a new custom tuned sound calibration system to not only optimize noise canceling but the sound quality for your particular ears every time you place the buzz in your ears a proprietary tone is played and a microphone measures your ear canals acoustic response it takes about half a second or so but you definitely notice that the noise cancelling has undergone some optimization it's really impressive just how much the sound around you was muffled bose says it's targeted frequencies that were previously difficult to reduce in the mid and high range like the voices of nearby co-workers screaming babies and family distractions in your home office i used this in my home next to a relatively loud hvac unit and the noise cancelling basically completely silenced it was more impressed with how much sound it reduced when i walked in the streets of new york and rode the subway you can still hear people's voices but they seem to be muffled by about 60 percent it's a little startling when you take the buds out of your ears or put them into transparency mode just how much sound is being filtered out and yes that transparency mode bose calls it in aware mode it's also improved it does sound more natural and lifelike the best transparency modes like on the airpods pro make it seem as if you're not wearing earbuds and can hear the world as it would sound without earbuds in your ears these do a good job of getting you close to that sensation while the drivers appear to be the same or very similar to those found in the original quietcomfort earbuds those reps told me that thanks to the custom tune technology the sound is noticeably improved with more nuanced clarity depth and better accuracy and that's pretty much what you'll hear if you were to compare these to the originals everything is a little bit more clear and natural sounding their predecessors also had relatively big sound and by that i mean they have a pretty wide sound stage but the bass has a bit more definition and punch now and is a bit more detail and separation between instruments so you can hear them more distinctly i also thought they had just the right amount of warmth particularly with male and female vocals their tonal balance is overall very good while software and advanced algorithms play a big part in the quietcomfort earbuds performance they do feature four microphones in each but two of which are beam forming microphones to focus on picking up your voice voice calling performance was a weak point in the regional quiet comfort earbuds and boses clearly made an effort to improve it with better noise reduction and voice pick up during calls i think it's significantly better now but have a listen for yourself all right i'm in the streets of new york city i'm doing a test call right now with the earbuds i'll be blocked out by and large you sound very good to excellent when you're talking it sounds more like you're inside a big room not outside here's a tiny bit of background noise but when you're not talking you pretty much don't hear any background noise at all it's like the microphone goes dead as it should when you're not talking all right um there's a fair amount of street noise here there's a couple cars going by um i'm just talking a little bit more so that uh see what it sounds like when i'm talking okay on to battery life it's rated at six hours with noise cancelling on that's the same as the new airpods pro 2 and you get about three extra charges from the new trim down charging case which features usb-c charging but not wireless charging that seems a bit unfortunate since most earbuds in this price range including the airpods pro 2 feature wireless charging like their predecessors the quietcomfort earbuds 2 are splash proof with an ipx4 rating they also have similar touch controls with a swipe gesture for volume control that i like i thought the touch controls worked well and they are slightly customizable as for bluetooth flavors these are equipped with bluetooth 5.3 they use the aac and spc audio codecs but currently have no support for qualcomm's aptx audio codec or multi-point bluetooth pairing i was disappointed by that particularly by the lack of multi-point bluetooth pairing but there's some hope that that may change in the future that's because a bose rep told me that these earbuds are equipped with a 5 series qualcomm chip that chip supports multi-point bluetooth pairing and has app deck support so i think there's a good chance we'll see at least multi-point bluetooth pairing added in the future and perhaps other features it's worth noting that while the noise canceling is of the adaptive variety you can adjust its levels between three settings the earbuds also have adjustable equalizer settings so you can tweak the sound profile i'll finish by saying that i did compare these to some other top earbuds including sony's wf-1000x mark iv which were released in june of 2021 and lists for 20 less these bose buds have surpassed those sony buds not only in terms of sound quality noise canceling but also voice calling and fit we'll have a full comparison of the airpods pro 2 in a separate video i can't get into all the details on apple's new buds just yet but like i said if you're someone who can't get a really secure fit from the airpods pro these are a compelling alternative for a little bit more but the performance improvements to the airpods pro 2 make them a pretty safe and enticing choice for iphone users for 50 less than these that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider these if you're an ios user but the airpods pro have their own set of advantages for ios users the same can be said for samsung's excellent galaxy but 2 pro earbuds and samsung galaxy device owners those buds have certain features that only galaxy owners can take advantage of including high resolution audio over bluetooth if you have the right setup but again the quietcomfort earbuds 2 may offer a better fit for you and i do think they sound slightly better than both the galaxy butts 2 and the pixel buds pro and have better noise cancelling as i said if you can get a tight seal with these buds the noise cancelling is really impressive probably the best out there right now as always feel free to post your views in the comments section and let me know what you think about their new design and whether you think they're worth 299 dollars after what i've told you about them if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david carnoy thanks for

22,hQfT2mFbg7E,These are OBJECTIVELY great! - Bose QuietComfort Buds 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQfT2mFbg7E,ShortCircuit, ow my little finger got caught in there what are the two best truly wireless earbuds on the market airpods Pro Gen 2 probably and the second one the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds 2. we tested them we're going to show you some graphs about how they sound objectively and we're also going to open this box up and see how they work start here at this QR code not doing that case is kind of weird shaped it's like a badge like a sheriff's badge and here are the buds themselves a cable USB a to c and some extra tips and fins small and large mediums already equipped and then you've got large and large I guess they're not small medium large they're just different bigger bump on these ones a lot of time they're Fitness oriented to try to you know keep them in your ears better but these fins are really low profile especially the ones that are presently equipped so I probably would just keep these on and actually I wonder if yeah they kind of look incomplete without them I peel that back and there's just like a little missing empty track now so how do they look pretty normal oh it just made a noise and that noise is actually a sort of calibration for your ear canal it's called Bo's custom tune and when that noise is being played it's kind of like you can think of echolocation it's measuring how long it takes the source signals that it sends out there to bounce back and return and making like a map of your ear and then tuning the sound based on that I like that there's no user interaction it's not like a part of the app where you have to go to and say like test my hearing it's just part of using them and it sounds pretty cool not a great lid sound not a really satisfying hinge or snap open either for the fidgeters among you but it's a pocketable case I'd say not as Tiny or smooth as this apple just kills it but this isn't a Bose versus airpods video there's an app and I'm going to try to add these earphones to it little button there they are connect the magic experience okay battery levels on the left and right are exposed here but what about uh the case itself it doesn't tell me there's an EQ which is nice I don't believe the airpods have that at all but other than presets this gives you the actual control up to what do they call plus and minus 10. it's only three different levels so you get your mid lows mids and highs not as nice as having like a full Matrix where you can do it in different like discrete jumps of frequency range left shortcut touch and hold the left earbud to use your shortcut so that's the only button that you can adjust hey play and pause the thing with these is it's always either on or transparency is odd on you can't just turn it off which you can with the airpods you go ANC on ANC off transparency on I want to find out what it feels like to adjust the ANC and the transparency levels but before that I gotta just listen to these things thanks to pataka for sponsoring today's video if you talk it makes magsafe compatible armored fiber phone cases and accessories their light and thin design comes in black gray or a fusion weave design for those that want a little more personality they offer a whole ecosystem of magsafe products from their four in one mag easy slider the mag easy car mount Pro use their slider to charge your iPhone Apple watch and airpods all at the same time and with the strength of pitaka's magnets there's no need to worry about your phone slipping from the car mount even if you're driving over bumps they didn't say that part I I put that part in don't run people over though so check out pitaka in the links in the video description alright the music's playing and I tap to pause I kind of missed it pause play doesn't matter which one you use next track oh that's registered volume volume is is swipe but that double top registered as volume next I just next it right into an ad oh now I'm in aware mode okay so this is transparency is on but I can obviously still hear the music I'm in relax mode it's like the closest thing to off maybe Focus that's uh really similar to relax I don't know it's very ambiguous that's the default interface you can change the press and hold to to not cycle through modes but instead hail the assistant and I believe that's just on the left but here's an explanation of what the modes are quiet has a little information guy beside it mutes the world around you so you can better hear and feel it okay so it's ANC on but aware it doesn't have that little info thing it has a settings button here are your surroundings and your music at the same time it has active sense if things get too loud Bose automatically adjust the amount of noise cancellation so that you can enjoy music comfortably that's the same thing that airpods have so basically there's like a decibel like limit I believe it's 85 decibels on the airpods and anything that's louder than that just gets brought down uh you can turn that on and off on here obviously you don't have a choice on airpods everything is just the way that Apple thinks you want it you can like set anything in relax there's no verbal explanation or written explanation of what it is but you can switch up the noise cancellation aggressiveness my voice is very isolated all the hissing that was around me went away now it's like there's like a a distant highway or like white noise generator somewhere as far as like whether or not turning this up and down makes it more like cabin pressure feeling e not really I kind of feel like it when it's Max but it might be just an illusion because of the other things that change now what happens when I look at Focus mode same deal different starting point maybe so for both Focus and relax where you have the ability to change this if you go below middle that's like amplifying the transparency mode and if you go above the middle that's like amplifying the active noise canceling if you're in the middle I guess you get a bit of both you can kind of hear the world around you but engine noise and air conditioning are kind of blocked out that's cool and you can save these presets too you can actually rename them oh they give you some things um to choose from like walk and work out I don't see how I can type my own that's why not you guys whatever but that's nice you know you could go from the preset I like when I'm in the office versus the preset I like to have when I'm walking to the office kind of annoying that there's four I wish I could disable some of them so that when I'm cycling through it's just two or three oh it's so annoying if I tap here it should turn it up to that point you shouldn't have to swipe what you can see here is how the headphones measured which is the green line versus the Harman Kardon Target line so why isn't it just zero zero being a flat frequency response where nothing is above or below the artist's intent basically well the reason is your ears are imperfect your ears are actually more sensitive to different frequency ranges than others so for example you can see that the Harman Kardon curve says that you should probably crank up the bass and the high because we're less good at hearing those sounds we're better at hearing mid-range because that's where human voices and lots of other sounds in nature that are relevant to us like those boxes falling ah I love you so much so as you can see this follows that Target curve really nicely almost the whole way except for around 2.5 k there's a little bump so to some people by default these might sound a little bright you can use the EQ that we saw on the app to turn that down a little bit so on this chart what you're looking at is what we call purse of equal loudness so because your ears are less sensitive to Bass when you turn your music to a low volume A lot of times we just can't hear the bass anymore so on your stereo AVR or on either of these pairs of earphones they'll actually compensate for that so you can see in this chart they base the Boost quite a bit and when you turn up the volume Green's a little louder and orange is louder than that this stuff mostly happens on the low end the base which is the left side now dynamic range compression is not something that's happening on purpose on on the earphones this is basically you turn up your music really loud and the load that you're putting on the headphones starts to exceed their capabilities like they just requires too much power or they're going to clip or something they will actually play certain frequencies more quietly because they just can't deliver so you can see on the right side of this graph if you turn them up really loud which is the red line under 2K it starts to drop off and then above 12 or 13k it like hits a cliff and so if you're listening to like a really high delicate violin it'll be quieter so like that as you turn up the music the the prominence of that violin may be sounding like it's in the foreground and nice and clear and Loud it'll just start to kind of back away and be and quieter and quieter and you can see the Orange is uh lower volume than red and green and blue are lower still so it's really only when you crank it pretty loud here if you're looking at the left side of the graph don't pay attention to that it's not that you're getting less bass as you crank these loud this is actually just a Vestige of the curves of equal loudness so it's just kind of like a measurement problem another interesting thing is if you turn it up really loud and the headphones can't deliver it you might actually hear this as like pumping like the music is kind of surging and getting quieter and the reason for that is that music isn't of equal loudness as a song plays like every bar there could be a kick drum and then that could be more load than the quieter parts of the bar in between kick drums so that means that the load imposed onto the headphones every bar varies and when it's a lot of load that's when the headphones kind of hack it anymore and that's where you're gonna see drops on the graph because when those impedances hit they just can't deliver all the power that they need to but then an instant later in the song There's not as much music happening and they can deliver and the volume kind of picks up again so you get this surging effect in in volume the next graph is a comparison between the bows and the airpods for noise cancellations so lower is better here you can see that in general the airpods have better cancellation especially in the mid-range but there is a one spot where the bows do a lot better it's around five kilohertz there's like a 10 DB difference all sounds that you hear have a mix of frequencies it's not just like engine noises all all low even engine noise is going to have some High bands in it as well so it's hard to say like that five kilohertz spot is where you're gonna hear this instrument or something like that it's all kind of like in general but you can see that both of these things don't really do much until you get around 60 hertz and that's kind of where you're going into the from sub bass to base because the sub bass stuff is stuff you're not going to hear it's stuff you're going to feel and obviously the noise cancellation isn't going to really affect that but in terms of uh noise you're going to hear on a plane it looks like the Bose does just as well but the airpods appear to do better with voice voices that's where you can see that mid-range people talking babies crying uh airpods might be a little bit better but these are both doing pretty well for battery life they're advertising six hours that's on the buds they actually don't tell you what they expect to get out of the case they do tell you that you can charge the case in three hours and you can charge the buds in one hour and 20 minutes after charge gets you two hours of playback so oh they're okay pretty standard the price though they are 300 which is fifty dollars more than the airpods so if you're an iPhone person I I Feel Like These are pretty neck and neck in a lot of ways but that price and that Apple Magic you're gonna get is you might want the airpods for everybody else you're not gonna get any Apple Magic on your Android device and these are very good so um maybe that extra 50 bucks would be worth it for you they definitely sound great and both of these are great earbuds Christmas is coming I don't think anyone can be really be mad if they get either of these so thanks for watching short circuit if you like this video hit like and hit subscribe and hit up our back catalog where we review other earbuds

23,Wkjm07Z6Xmg,Still a Rip off?! 🤨 Bose QC II Earbuds Review after 300 Days...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkjm07Z6Xmg,Aaron X Loud and Wireless, one of the most popular videos on this channel is when I reviewed the Bose qc2 earbuds many of you subscribed to my channel because of that video and some of you might be wondering I've had the bows for almost a year now and in that time there have been several firmware updates and even some new features that were added later on like the ability to use the left and right earbud alone adaptive transparency so in all of that time have I changed my mind at all about the Bose qc2 buckle up because I'm going to talk about its pros and cons after 300 days of using these earbuds and are they worth buying if you want to check its latest price I've included a link to it in the description below first let's talk about the pros as a reviewer I have so many buds in my collection but I just keep coming back back to the Bose qc2 for several reasons and reason number one is the fit these offer one of the best stability and comfort and the wings keep them in place very well I myself do use them a lot for running half an hour on the treadmill with these earbuds and no matter how sweaty my ears get these remain stable second the controls it has big touch pads which allow for a wider range of controls on each earbud music playback ANC and transparency toggles and it's also possible to swipe and control the volume on both ears so if you want to use just one earbud alone and leave the other in the case you still have full access to all of the controls that's worth mentioning because of how rare it is now off the top of my head the only other one that lets you do that full range of controls on one earbud is the airpods pro 2. but if I'm wrong and there are others in the market that can also do that let me know in the comments third the sound now this is going to be a pretty controversial take because the qc2s were never really meant to appeal to audio files and what audio files are looking for is mostly that golden hi-res Wireless label which is the next best thing to pull high-res but I find that it's audio quality is good enough to please most people and not bad enough to piss anyone off avoiding many of the mistakes that other brands make like overly aggressive mids boomi bass or sibilance now I won't go so far as to say that this sounds amazing but for me its track separation is clean enough it's detailed enough Bassy enough and it's sound staging is open enough to enjoy if you want to compare its sound quality to buds from other brands visit Loudoun wireless.com sound samples page Link in the description and the last point of why I keep coming back to the Bose is its active noise canceling out of everything I've tested it cancels the most noise the it rumbling noises dumping down the sound of human speech it's really the only reason why I take these with me whenever I go on flights because crying babies yeah it's become indispensable really and if you do take it to the gym like me the ANC on these do not stutter when you run it may not be the most portable but for that kind of noise canceling end the way it maintains ANC Power by locking into my ears properly while being comfortable to wear that's a trade-off that I'm willing to make actually this is a nice segue to the first cons of the qc2 which is its size it's gotten a lot smaller compared to the first version which was a dinosaur but still bulky compared to my other daily driver the Sony link Birds s which is really a cute little thing compared to the Bose qc2 now I don't mind just bringing these buds with me put them in my ears and leave the case at home because it's battery life is not bad but if I do need to bring the case with me because I'm meeting friends or going to events and usually just bring something else with a case that's more convenient and less bulging the second con is it's called quality this is something that many Brands can get quite right because of how difficult it is after all these things are so far away from your mouth but they're expected to pick up your voice while ignoring every other ambient noise now this stuff is hard but right now it's getting better the nothing here to use call Quality is quite impressive as are some other products but I can't say the same for the qc2 it's usable in quiet scenarios but if you do need to take a call in a noisy place your voice is either gonna sound very far away or a lot of the noise is gonna leak in it won't really block wind noise either so the person on the line with you is gonna hear flapping noises the third con is that you can't turn off active noise canceling it's either different levels of noise canceling or transparency now the reason why somebody might want to turn off ANC is to conserve battery but you don't even have that option at all on the Bose qc2 con number four is that it still does not have multi-point pairing which is the ability to connect up to two devices at once and seamlessly switch between them most premium buds already have that but the Bose still doesn't so even if some things have improved over the past year which makes these better value today compared to you when it first came out like single earbud use and active sense transparency the fact that it still lacks multi-point does mean that it's still lacking in terms of features compared to competitors from Sony Sennheiser and others but keeping in mind the pros and cons and the updates that have improved it I'm more comfortable now recommending these compared to when it first launched if you need insanely good and reliable noise canceling fit and comfort I mean it's noise canceling still mind-blowingly good industry leading in fact if you

24,Jqn6xt_YP_c,Huge DISAPPOINTMENT: Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II Review!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqn6xt_YP_c,CEONTHEMAKING, all right so since the release of the original bose quietcomfort true wireless earbuds these have been my number one recommendation as far as the best active noise cancelling earbuds that you can buy so whenever someone asks me which earbuds have the best anc i always tell them the bose quietcomfort now they're not my personal favorite as far as like sound quality and just everything across the board but in my opinion there's no question that they cancel out the most amount of noise out of any pair of earbuds that i've ever tried so when they announced the second generation of the quietcomfort earbuds i was super excited because i figured that they would address some of the areas that you know needed addressing with the original version but sadly that's not the case so we're going to talk about everything you need to know about these earbuds but first let's start off with something that they actually did get right which is the redesign of the case as well as the earbuds so a big gripe for a lot of people including myself is that the charging case on the first generation is super large and just overly bulky so i was definitely happy to see that they reduced the size and just made the case much more pocketable this time around there's still other options out there that have even smaller cases but you can clearly see this is a definite improvement over the first generation the earbuds are also noticeably smaller and more compact and this time around instead of using one solid ear tip with an ear wing attached they chose to use a combination of ear tips and what they call stability bands which are basically you know ear fins but the fact that they're separate from each other means that you can try a number of different combinations to get the best fit for your specific ears and speaking of the fit these work extremely well for me so we'll talk more about that here shortly another thing that they got right this time around are the controls because now you can control everything directly from the earbuds whereas before we didn't get access to everything so now you're able to play and pause you're able to track forward as well as track backward you can adjust your volume you can change your ambient mode as well as activate your voice assistant so that means fewer times that you'll have to actually reach for your phone these also have in-ear detection so anytime you remove one of the earbuds from your ear your music will automatically pause so let's go back and talk about the fit obviously everybody's ears are different but for me the fit on these is incredible the smaller size along with the ear fins and the ear tips give me a very secure fit so i can absolutely wear these to the gym or go for a run or do any sort of physical activity and they're also really comfortable the first time i tried them on i ended up leaving them in my ears for about two hours which honestly never happens but again it's going to depend heavily on the size and shape of your ears so these are running bluetooth 5.3 and as far as codecs they're giving us the standard sbc and aac so no aptx no ldac or any of the more advanced options so that brings us to one of the elephants in the room and that is the fact that there's no single usage mode so i just knew for sure that they would fix this with the second generation because it was the same thing on the first generation but anytime you take the right earbud and place it into the case the left earbud disconnects and now i know before a lot of people will say oh it works as long as you don't close the charging case well to me that doesn't count yeah if you're you know using the earbuds on your computer and you're at a desk or something like that you could put the earbud in the case and just leave it open okay but to me that doesn't count what if you're outside and you want to use the left earbud independently you can't really put the case in your pocket and leave it open i mean i guess you could try but you shouldn't really have to do that with a pair of earbuds at this price point so the fact that in 2022 going into 2023 bose has released a pair of earbuds that don't give you the option to use them independent of each other it's kind of mind-blowing to me because i can get on amazon right now and find a pair of 20 earbuds 30 earbuds that give me that option so that's one of the features or aspects that has me kind of frustrated with these earbuds as far as battery life we're looking close to the same numbers as the first generation so we're going to get about six hours on a single charge with a total of around 24 including the case so the per charge use is the exact same as before but we are getting about six additional hours from the case and they also support fast charging so just 20 minutes will give you around two hours of listening time now this brings us to the second elephant in the room and that's the fact that they took away wireless charging so they upped the price and then took away a feature as significant as wireless charging that's another decision that i don't quite understand now i'm not a you know wireless charging exclusive type of person like i can live without wireless charging but on a pair of flagship earbuds at this price point that is a feature that i pretty much expect so the fact that they took it away has me very frustrated as well another feature that i don't necessarily expect but would have been nice is multi-point connection so with these you're not able to connect the two devices and switch back and forth between the two however the earbuds can remember multiple devices and then you can switch the connection using the bose music app so as far as water resistance these have an ipx4 rating which means they'll have no problem with standing sweat and light splashes of water so that's going to be useful if you're a very active person just make sure you don't completely submerge them in water so let's go ahead and talk active noise cancellation these are still giving you top tier performance so they're going to be great at blocking out lower frequency sounds but not only that these are also surprisingly good at blocking out higher frequency sounds like voices which is usually pretty tough when it comes to anc earbuds so if your number one goal is to block out as much noise as possible there's nothing that's going to give you better performance than the bose quiet comfort 2. as far as the aware mode or ambient mode it does a great job of allowing you to hear your surroundings so it's going to be useful if you need to have a conversation or just be more in tune with your surroundings i do think there's other options out there that have more effective ambient modes overall but you can certainly get by with the performance on these the ambient mode also has an option called smartsense which will reduce sudden loud noises so this is going to help prevent the earbuds from blasting your eardrums if you're in a quiet environment and then all of a sudden there's a really loud noise and it actually works really well but i feel like sometimes it reacts to sounds that aren't really that loud so it can become a little distracting at times so as far as sound quality bose always gives us some very well balanced sound especially in terms of treble and clarity and that's still the case with the quiet comfort 2. except this time around i feel like there's slightly more emphasis on the bass it comes off a little bit more pronounced compared to the first generation which is great if you prefer a little bit more punch in terms of bass otherwise you can tone the bass down using the in-app eq so while these earbuds are definitely delivering some very enjoyable sound quality i think more than anything you're paying for the performance of the active noise cancellation so really quick let's go ahead and do a quick microphone test all right so this is a microphone test of the new bose quiet comfort 2 true wireless earbuds so right now we have quiet conditions so this should give you an idea as to how you would sound in a quiet environment now let's see how they sound once we add some background noise all right so now we got some crowd noise being played on a speaker so this should give you a rough idea as to how you would sound if you choose to take calls in a more noisy environment testing testing one two three testing testing one two three so overall these still hold the number one spot as far as active noise cancelling ability the sound quality is also slightly improved and they're much smaller and much more compact but the fact that there's still no single usage mode along with the fact that they took away wireless charging both of those things are very hard for me to look past especially at this price point so i'm curious to know what you guys think make sure you let me know down in the comment section below and aside from that that's going to cover it for today's video do me a favor if you found it to be helpful go ahead and give it a thumbs up as well as consider subscribing to the channel and as always i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] you,Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2,Since the release of the original

25,9iBvAP2BCRM,Best ANC Earbuds 2022? (Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iBvAP2BCRM,Mike O'Brien, what you're looking at right here is a brand new pair of earbuds from bose that claims to have the best active noise cancellation in the industry these are the new bose quietcomfort earbuds too and these i would venture as far as to say are the most improved earbuds compared to their previous model which by no means was a bad model the original bose quiet comfort earbuds were for a while among the kings of active noise cancellation they sounded amazing they blocked everything out around you but these are just substantially better not only do we have a much better design with a smaller case smaller more comfortable earbuds but also a new suite of features on here and a lot we'll talk about throughout this video so i want to start off with the physical design with these for the case like i said i'm not going to make this video these versus the old quiet comforts because there's a lot different but i'm going to highlight some of the big things i really like about these you'll figure out from there which ones are the improvements but the case is so much smaller than the older version it's still by no means a tiny case so you can see like right here so this is what it looks like next to the galaxy buds 2 pro case which is a relatively small case and you can see bose still has a chunkier case but with that you're getting a pretty long battery life with active noise cancellation on you're getting six hours in the earbuds and 30 hours when you include the case on the back we have a button for pairing we've got wireless charging on these we have usb type-c on the bottom and if we open them up the earbuds themselves again have a massive redesign i was very happy to see this i'm so happy bose did this and the earbuds have let's go through them one at a time so we have the silicone ear tip on there there are three different sizes so it should fit very comfortably in your ear it's kind of an oval design some people love that some people don't like that but you can't deny that you're getting great active noise cancellation out of these so it's making a really good seal on the top then we're actually getting instead of a constant wing tip that you have to get one size for we can separately and independently choose a wing tip out of three different sizes that come in the box so it can hold differently on either ear differently from the silicone tip the ear tip so you can really customize these to fit perfectly and stay in your ears now these do have of course microphones on the inside as well as on the outside not only for calls but also for that active noise cancellation and that transparency mode there's a lot of new stuff with that that i'm going to talk about in a minute because bose was really excited about a lot of new features related to that but before we get to that one more thing i want to point out with the physical design here is that on the outside we do have not only touch pads but also swipe capabilities as well so on that stem right there we can swipe up and down and that's a great way to control the volume in a very easy and intuitive way now although these are very customizable from my experience in all honesty they're very comfortable i wear them but if i try to go for a run with them they do tend to work their way out of my left ear which for me has always been a challenge with most earbuds airpods pro included most other earbuds included it's very rare that they'll stay in my left ear and it's no exception with these unfortunately so like i said while it is very comfortable it's not perfect at staying in my ears personally now these also have ipx4 water resistance so if these do stay in your ears while you're running the good news is that sweat or a light drizzle should not damage them now let's get into the bread and butter of these earbuds the active noise cancellation and the aware mode so the transparency mode so to speak these never turn that off so you can change between 11 different levels but at no point will you turn it off the system is always running and what bose is so excited about what these do is essentially you put them in your ears they play a tone and that tone is listening with the microphones to kind of map out your ear geometry and figure out the best profile for your ears with regards to the sound but also with regards to the active noise cancellation to give you the best possible not only anc but also transparency mode and honestly it does a fantastic job when i'm using these and i have aware mode on i can hear everything around me very well it sounds very natural it's in real time doesn't sound robotic it really is a fantastic experience i find that i can easily hold a conversation with somebody or if i'm working at my desk listen to music and hear everything around me as i need to i think that's really important if you're outside and it is windy these do a decent job of kind of bringing the wind down but you do still pick up some of that wind in the microphones from my testing at least when it's at full maximum transparency mode now they do have something really cool in here that's called active sense and this allows you to essentially block out the higher decibel sound so if you're walking on the sidewalk and you have transparency mode on and then somebody drops something really loud next to you or there's a jackhammer it'll tone that back a little bit so you don't blow your ears out and that's a feature i love to see it's also something coming out on a lot of other earbuds these days like the new airpods so it's a really great future proof feature there but speaking of future proof these also do have bluetooth 5.3 i don't know why i wanted to mention that now but it seems like something that i'm very happy to see on a newer pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation then once again these do a fantastic job i will actually will test these side by side with some of the best ones out there like sony sennheiser the new airpods if you guys want to see that definitely go down and click that subscribe button but as far as these as a standalone device they're doing a fantastic job you're blocking out everything around you and while a lot of people like to only focus on the power like the raw volume of the anc i would say that there's a lot more to it there's many layers to active noise cancellation like how they interact with wind how smooth it is how much white noise you have and what different frequencies they block out and i would say that in general these are giving me among the best experiences out there where if i go outside on a windy day it doesn't pick up the wind it does a fantastic job of not picking up the wind and giving me a nice quiet experience similarly people talking are usually a tricky thing for earbuds usually earbuds do a great job of blocking out you know for example like a rumbly fridge or an air conditioner but these obviously do that as well but for voices again they're able to block a lot of voices even higher frequency voices like female voices tend to be an especially difficult thing for earbuds and these once again do a fantastic job there now a lot of that is thanks to the drivers and the microphones on here so let's actually get into a microphone test and see how it sounds when you're on a phone call by a busy road on a windy day all right so i'm out here by a really busy road it's also really breezy but as somebody talking on the phone right now i would say that i can hear my voice really well but this is doing a great job of not letting in too much sound around me like not too much wind not too much of the traffic i feel like being on a phone call with this is pretty comfortable but leave a comment and let me know how this sounds to you and how these microphones actually perform and as far as the sound quality goes with these earbuds they're being made by bose so it's no surprise they sound really good on paper the specs might not look the most promising they don't have aptx or aptx hd or ldac or any higher end codec on there they're limited to just spc and aac but all things considered when you're actually using the earbuds you wouldn't necessarily know it they really do a great job they have a very nice balance to them you're getting very powerful bass and sub bass as well that delivers clean bass lines you're able to hear all those lower frequencies and of course it doesn't get muddy or eclipse any kind of mids on there as well so vocals are crisp and detailed and very easy to hear and then the highs again you can really have some pretty decent instrument separation on here as well i do have to say i wish there was a little bit more detail in there that's something that if you listen to other premium pairs of earbuds around this price generally you're getting just a tad more detail and clarity on those but listening to these like i said a great balance and overall a nice warm profile that sounds good with most genres of music out there in addition to that i usually add a disclaimer when i talk about sound that everybody has different ear geometry but with these the goal is to get rid of that variable so that everybody puts these in their ear and it calibrates to them and you should be getting the same experience no matter who you are which of course you can still have different preferences and different genres but hopefully the ear geometry is no longer a big variable so far in this video i've been talking about a lot of positives about these earbuds right great active noise cancellation great microphones great customizable fit great sound quality but not everything's perfect with these there are some compromises that you need to be aware of and going through those the first one is that surprisingly they don't have mono mode or at least not from my experience connecting to a samsung galaxy device if i put only the right earbud in my ear while the left one is in the case it is not able to connect it actually disconnects and it turns the earbud off similarly you do not have multi-point connectivity so you can't connect to a laptop and a phone simultaneously uh you can have up to like seven different devices remembered by this so as soon as you click connect on the new device it'll switch over to that but it's not a seamless automatic connection like for example if you have music on your laptop and then you get a phone call it's not going to automatically switch over to your phone as i mentioned a few times throughout this video these are not able to turn off that engine that runs the active noise cancellation you always have either ambient mode or active noise cancellation or one of the 11 levels between them and so most people most of the time will not care about that at all so it's really not a negative but for me personally maybe i'm just kind of weird with this when i go for a run i don't want to hear like nothing i don't want full active noise cancellation but if you start going over to the ambient modes it will pick up a little bit more wind and so for me with most earbuds i'll just turn it off that's what i really like to do so it blocks out some passive stuff around me but i can hear cars i can hear things that i need to hear while i'm running and so that's really important to me and with these you're not able to do that again maybe i'm the weird one you can leave a comment below and let me know if you do anything similar to that but for me personally that's a bit of a drawback but it doesn't really matter because as i mentioned for me personally these aren't really the best earbuds for running the ear tips don't or the wing tips don't really hold it in my left ear well enough everybody has weird ears maybe mine are just weird by these standards but the good news is if you're sitting indoors or any kind of studio type you know office environment these are very comfortable great sound quality great active noise cancellation overall a really solid pair of earbuds so that's my take on the bose quietcomfort earbuds 2. not the best name but a really solid pair of earbuds and i'm really excited to compare these to other earbuds on the market if you enjoyed the video consider liking and subscribing i'm mike

little bit later you have your ear tips and you have a USBC to USB a cable oh it has a nice soft touch finish to it there's an LED here the nice Bose logo right there a USBC at the bottom oh and very nice they have a button on the back so it's easy to pair I love that and then the motor truth open it up there they are check that out they're nice and small have a nice black glossy finish to it you can see over here we have the microphones you have a little sensor here that you might be able to see and another microphone and charging points there so it looks very nice has nice little wing tips here that I really like and it oval shaped ear tip and it looks like a little microphone over here on the back as well oh no designed to fit you and just everything that you do I especially like using earbuds when I'm working out or traveling because they're small light and don't take up a lot of space now my first impressions of these are that they are definitely very comfortable they have an extremely firm fit in there but doesn't actually feel overbearing or tight in your ear those wing tips are really a game changer especially when running I have like no hesitation or concerns or anxieties about them falling out at all these are perfect for any sort of working out so if you're if you're really looking for that this is definitely the one to go for they do have an ipx4 rating so you don't have to worry about sweating too much when you're working out or from some light rain and water they're also rated for six hours of battery life or 24 hours with the charging case you can charge over USBC but there's no wireless charging capability and there are even little sensors on here that can detect when it's in your ear or not so it'll stop playing sound if you take it out of your arrow and resume playback once you're back in here not having that is really annoying so it's a must-have on an earbud and of course there are microphones on here that are supposed to give you crystal clear and natural sounding phone calls we'll hear how that sounds later on in the video you also have the Bose fit kit which includes different sizes of soft silicone ear tips and stability bands to get the perfect fit and comfort for your specific gear I really like that they have stability bands in here they're super helpful if you're especially active as they help you maintain a more secure fit one of the most important things for having the best sound is having the correct ear tips in your ears if they're too small or too big for your specific ear it can make them not sound as full or can impact the quality of the ANC you really need to make sure that you pick the right ones and put it in properly for the best experience you could use a mirror to help out with that alright let's connect it to a phone this does have the latest Bluetooth 5.3 capability so that should help with having a more reliable high quality connection at longer distances than older versions okay yeah the Bose music app open here and we're just going to click on add that headphones and frames and I think it should be able to find it here now yep I already opened it up and there it is and there you are we're already connected now one of the features that Bose has to help with making sure that you have the right ear tips is their ear tip fit test this is a neat custom tune calibration technology feature built into the Bose music app that allows you to check to make sure that you have the the correct ear tips and that it's seated correctly in your ear it also provides personalized noise cancellation and Sound Performance just for your specific gears I think this is pretty handy and a great feature I really stress the correct fit so anything that makes it easier for people to get that is a win in my book now interesting thing you may actually have different size ears so you may need different ear tips on your earbuds so that's kind of crazy that no ear is the same and strangely my right ear is bigger than my left one I don't know okay let's try them out and see if I have a good fit all right in order to use the earbud fit test hit the gear icon in the top right hit that right there hit run test oh I already heard the classic bow sound go between both of the ears okay looks like we have a good seal do the headphone Shake does it feel stable I'd say so now I know Bose designed these to have a deep immersive sound with powerful bass and High Fidelity audio I'm actually gonna play some music because I actually haven't listened to these alright so these have that classic Bose sound that so many of you love and tell me about in the comments has a really solid deep bass a little bit elevated there and very clean shimmering highs so it's not going to sound muffled and dull it's going to have that really high in air to it that sounds really clear without being harsh the Bose music app is also how you install updates and personalize the audio in the active noise cancellation to your taste there's a lot in here you have the source button over here so if you have this connected to multiple devices you can adjust that here the modes button right here allows you to adjust between quiet which is active noise cancellation aware which is transparency mode and you can choose between some custom options so if you click create mode you can see all the options here and when you've added one you can see it over here you can tap on it and then you can adjust the level of noise cancellation or transparency mode you can also adjust the shortcut options and here's a good customization option you can adjust EQ which I really like as an audio engineer I always like having as many bands as possible no surprise but we do have the bass mid and treble sliders here if you want to Tinker a little bit and there are some presets here if you just want a quick adjustment now many know that Bose has some industry-leading actors noise cancellation or ANC and I agree they're one of the best out there this is great if you need to tune out a bunch of noise and distractions so you can have a bit more quiet hear your music better ANSI has been really helpful for me as my roommate works from home along with me and he can be a little noisy and with all the traveling I'm doing now it's really great on a plane so let's turn it on we're next to a road right here so we have a whole bunch of cars driving by uh so I'm just gonna turn on the active noise cancellation right now from off to White and see how it turns out cutting out a lot of that high-end the hissing from all of the tires and things like that so it's definitely bringing down the volume but we have some samples for you to listen to yourself so let me know what you think and how it performs over there now the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too also have a transparency mode with active sense so you can hear your surroundings clearly without having to take your earbuds out of your ears this is super important to me so I don't always feel closed off one thing that they added that is pretty neat is the ability to lower the volume of any sudden loud sound so it doesn't hurt your ears this is really great if you're working out and either you or someone else sets down weights and it makes a loud clanking noise I imagine what's technically going on here is that they have a limiter that detects a loud noise it limits how loud it can go or activates the active noise cancellation so it doesn't harm your ears or at least make it hurt to hear I'm a big fan of that and when I test it out over here it's crazy it hits immediately it works extremely well here's my first impressions of transparency mode Let's enable it and oh my gosh this is extremely natural sounding I actually can't this is weird like I actually don't hear much of a difference at all in terms of what it sounds like around me and with them in there might be like a little bit of that electronic like hiss there a little bit that I can tell but honestly I can't really can you say something real quick testing one two three how's it going it's yeah it's it sounds it like real this is the most real life thing I've ever heard it's astonishing quiet now you can actually control a lot of settings with the tension controls on the earbuds you can adjust between quiet and aware mode or ANC or transparency mode you can also do the usual play pause answer calls change tracks and activate the assistant on your phone now let's see how the microphone and call Quality sounds and here is a microphone test using the Bose QuietComfort earbuds too next to this little water feature here a little little Fountain thing how do you think it sounds and here the microphone sounds like next to a busy road here is a microphone test with the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too in a very quiet controlled Studio environment where I have a whole bunch of Sound Treatment and this is what it would sound like if you were to receive an HD phone call while wearing the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds too how do you think it sounds so my first impressions and thoughts of the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds too are that they're a great option for those of you who really love that Bose sound so this is going to be a great option for those of you who love that and I know that they talk a lot about their active noise cancellation which is definitely very good but I really wish they would have emphasized how good the transparency mode is on these I've never heard something that sounds as good as this on earbuds so that's quite commendable we have the holidays coming up so maybe this will be a good gift for someone else or yourself maybe treat yourself if you'd like to find out more or purchase the Bose QuietComfort earbuds too there are links Down Below in the description and thank you so much to boost for sponsoring this showcase thanks so much for watching this is Tech today until next

27,1adxs49qIqA,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds review: Best noise canceling,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1adxs49qIqA,CNET, finally bose's new 280 dollar noise canceling quietcomfort earbuds arguably the best true wireless earbuds out there for muffling sound around you i also have the new 180 sport earbuds both sound really good so let's get right into how they stack up against the competition well it's worth spending the extra hundred dollars on the quietcomfort earbuds [Music] i'm gonna mainly focus on the choir comfort earbuds because they're the flagship after all and bose is known for its noise canceling and they don't disappoint in that department as far as noise cancelling goes these are top notch you can toggle through three customizable noise canceling settings including a transparency mode that lets sound in by tapping the left earbud using the touch controls at their top setting these did a better job at muffling sound than the airpods pro and sony wf 1000x mark iii i didn't take them on a plane but i do have an air conditioning system in my apartment that's fairly loud and the bose almost completely eliminated the fan sound although sony and the airpods pro did a good job tamping down the sound the bose was better i also used them on the streets of new york city to impressive effect the quietcomfort earbuds also sound better than the airpods pro they're just richer sounding with better detail and more powerful bass that's also well defined the bose are right up there with the best sounding two wireless earbuds and go toe to toe the sennheiser momentum true wireless 2 which retails for 300 work well for a variety of music genres but fans of hip hop and edm will find they have plenty of kick to their base they're also good for making calls but maybe not quite as good as the airpods pro still they're a big improvement over boza's earlier soundsport free which only had mono sound in one bud for calls the quietcomfort earbuds effectively reduced ambient sound in the streets of new york during calls and callers so they could hear me well my voice was clear and i could hear collars really well i just wouldn't call the noise reduction stellar it isn't on the level for instance of bose's full-size noise-canceling 700 headphones a lot of people ask about this and you can use a single bud either left or right for calls or listening to music and when you pull one bud the other one automatically goes into a transparency mode so you don't have any weirdness of listening to one bud with noise cancelling on you get up to six hours of battery life on a single charge or about an hour more than the airpods pro the buds are sweat and weather resistant with a splash resistance rating of ipx4 and that's the same as the airpods [Music] pro quadcopter earbuds do have some downsides the airpods pro and popular android oriented butts like samsung's galaxy buts plus and galaxy buds live are significantly smaller and lighter and have really compact charging cases you gotta love that i did find the choir comfort earbuds comfortable to wear they use bose's new state ear max tips that have an integrated wing with the largest tip i got a tight seal and really secure fit and while they're smaller than bose's earlier sound sport free the quietcomfort buds do stick out a fair amount from your ears and if you tuck the case into the front pocket of a tight pair of jeans let's just say it leaves a noticeable bulge that said the case is smaller than the case for the beats powerbeats pro so it's not gigantic it has wireless charging capabilities and gives you an extra two charges there's also a quick charge feature that gives you two hours of battery life with a 15 minute charge i can't compare the bose to everything that's out there and some people will get on my case for talking so much about the airpods pro but they are the best selling true wireless noise cancelling earbuds and apple just added a new spatial audio virtual surround sound feature to them so they remain an attractive option for a little less than what the quietcomfort earbuds cost i do think it comes down to whether you're going to live with the bose's larger size and overall design for a lot of people the answer will be no the fact is design is important fit is important and the airpods pro are just lighter a little bit more comfortable and that means that more people are going to be willing to give up some sound quality and a little bit of noise canceling for that design but if great sound and noise cancelling is your priority the quiet comforter earbuds clearly have it it's no contest there now the other alternative is bose's cheaper sport earbuds which have the same ipx4 water resistance rating but an hour or less of battery life we've got links of where to buy both models down in the description sport earbuds don't sound quite as dynamic and their base doesn't go quite as deep as the base on the choir comfort earbuds but they're well balanced with nice detail and punchy bass overall they sound very good and also are good for making calls though maybe not quite as good as the quiet comfort earbuds well they do stick out from your ears they're smaller and lighter than quadcopter earbuds and their case is about 30 to 40 smaller though it doesn't have wireless charging [Music] i found them slightly more comfortable to wear and what you can use the quiet comfort earbuds for sporting activities i didn't have a problem running with them the sport earbuds will be better for runners simply because they are lighter if you don't need active noise cancer don't like it sensation the sport earbuds are probably the better value that said i do think a lot of people are going to be willing to spend that extra 100 simply because of the flexibility of having that noise cancelling and that little bit of extra bit of performance but the sporty buds do compete well against other earbuds in their price class and they do sound slightly better than less expensive models like the galaxy butts plus of course the butts plus are more discreet looking if you are in the market for a noise cancelling headphone i recently reviewed sony's new what mark iv a top over ear model so check out that video too it's a great headphone i'm david carney for cnet thanks for watching and let me know what you think in the comment section,Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds,bose's 280 dollar noise canceling quietcomfort earbuds arguably the best true wireless earbuds out there for muffling sound around you i also have the new 180 sport earbuds both sound really good.You can use a single bud either left or right for calls or listening to music and when you pull one bud the other one automatically goes into a transparency mode so you don't have any weirdness of listening to one with noise cancelling on you get up to six hours of battery life on a single charge or about an hour more than the airpods pro. While they're smaller than bose's earlier sound sport free the quietcomfort buds do stick out a fair amount from your ears.The sport earbuds have the same ipx4 water resistance rating but an hour or less of battery life.They sound slightly better than less expensive models like the galaxy iv headphone noise cancelling model.
28,3Q4ni8AXw4A,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 Review: Noise-Canceling King,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q4ni8AXw4A,CNET, hey folks these are the bose quietcomfort earbuds too in case you missed it they were announced on the same day that apple introduced the airpods pro 2 and iphone 14 and they kind of got a bit lost in the shuffle they cost 299 so definitely pricey but now that i got my hands on a pair i got to say they're really good they fit my ears really well have great noise cancelling excellent sound and improved voice calling performance we can debate at the end whether they're too expensive but before we do that let me go over what i think makes them among the top few earbuds and what i think some people may find a little lacking here we go [Music] okay so for starters you can only get them in black at launch triple black is what bose calls the color but to you and me it's black sandstone is coming later in the year personally i like the lighter color a little better but black's just fine and a lot of people prefer it more importantly not only are the earbuds about 30 smaller than their predecessors but their case is about 40 smaller and truly pocketable while the original quietcomfort earbuds featured excellent noise canceling and very good sound quality they were pretty hefty and protruded from your ears the new buds each weigh a little less than .25 ounces or seven grams according to bows still not spelt but significantly smaller the other big changes to the ear tips bose has ditched its one piece state ear wing tips for a two-piece fit kit system that features separate ear tips and stability bands in three different size options that's supposed to give users more flexibility to get a secure fit and tight seal i did like the state ear wing tips but after trying the new two-piece system i'm sold on it i ended up going with the large tips in medium stability band and that really locked the buds in my ears i can't tell you that these will fit everyone's ears equally well if you're someone who can't get a secure fit with the air pods pro 2 which are lighter and quite comfortable wear this new two-piece fit kit system may be a reason to give the bose a go over the new airpods pro a handful of new premium earbuds feature a kind of auto custom tube feature that takes into account the shape of your ears and ear canal and bose has also developed a new custom tuned sound calibration system to not only optimize noise canceling but the sound quality for your particular ears every time you place the buzz in your ears a proprietary tone is played and a microphone measures your ear canals acoustic response it takes about half a second or so but you definitely notice that the noise cancelling has undergone some optimization it's really impressive just how much the sound around you was muffled bose says it's targeted frequencies that were previously difficult to reduce in the mid and high range like the voices of nearby co-workers screaming babies and family distractions in your home office i used this in my home next to a relatively loud hvac unit and the noise cancelling basically completely silenced it was more impressed with how much sound it reduced when i walked in the streets of new york and rode the subway you can still hear people's voices but they seem to be muffled by about 60 percent it's a little startling when you take the buds out of your ears or put them into transparency mode just how much sound is being filtered out and yes that transparency mode bose calls it in aware mode it's also improved it does sound more natural and lifelike the best transparency modes like on the airpods pro make it seem as if you're not wearing earbuds and can hear the world as it would sound without earbuds in your ears these do a good job of getting you close to that sensation while the drivers appear to be the same or very similar to those found in the original quietcomfort earbuds those reps told me that thanks to the custom tune technology the sound is noticeably improved with more nuanced clarity depth and better accuracy and that's pretty much what you'll hear if you were to compare these to the originals everything is a little bit more clear and natural sounding their predecessors also had relatively big sound and by that i mean they have a pretty wide sound stage but the bass has a bit more definition and punch now and is a bit more detail and separation between instruments so you can hear them more distinctly i also thought they had just the right amount of warmth particularly with male and female vocals their tonal balance is overall very good while software and advanced algorithms play a big part in the quietcomfort earbuds performance they do feature four microphones in each but two of which are beam forming microphones to focus on picking up your voice voice calling performance was a weak point in the regional quiet comfort earbuds and boses clearly made an effort to improve it with better noise reduction and voice pick up during calls i think it's significantly better now but have a listen for yourself all right i'm in the streets of new york city i'm doing a test call right now with the earbuds i'll be blocked out by and large you sound very good to excellent when you're talking it sounds more like you're inside a big room not outside here's a tiny bit of background noise but when you're not talking you pretty much don't hear any background noise at all it's like the microphone goes dead as it should when you're not talking all right um there's a fair amount of street noise here there's a couple cars going by um i'm just talking a little bit more so that uh see what it sounds like when i'm talking okay on to battery life it's rated at six hours with noise cancelling on that's the same as the new airpods pro 2 and you get about three extra charges from the new trim down charging case which features usb-c charging but not wireless charging that seems a bit unfortunate since most earbuds in this price range including the airpods pro 2 feature wireless charging like their predecessors the quietcomfort earbuds 2 are splash proof with an ipx4 rating they also have similar touch controls with a swipe gesture for volume control that i like i thought the touch controls worked well and they are slightly customizable as for bluetooth flavors these are equipped with bluetooth 5.3 they use the aac and spc audio codecs but currently have no support for qualcomm's aptx audio codec or multi-point bluetooth pairing i was disappointed by that particularly by the lack of multi-point bluetooth pairing but there's some hope that that may change in the future that's because a bose rep told me that these earbuds are equipped with a 5 series qualcomm chip that chip supports multi-point bluetooth pairing and has app deck support so i think there's a good chance we'll see at least multi-point bluetooth pairing added in the future and perhaps other features it's worth noting that while the noise canceling is of the adaptive variety you can adjust its levels between three settings the earbuds also have adjustable equalizer settings so you can tweak the sound profile i'll finish by saying that i did compare these to some other top earbuds including sony's wf-1000x mark iv which were released in june of 2021 and lists for 20 less these bose buds have surpassed those sony buds not only in terms of sound quality noise canceling but also voice calling and fit we'll have a full comparison of the airpods pro 2 in a separate video i can't get into all the details on apple's new buds just yet but like i said if you're someone who can't get a really secure fit from the airpods pro these are a compelling alternative for a little bit more but the performance improvements to the airpods pro 2 make them a pretty safe and enticing choice for iphone users for 50 less than these that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider these if you're an ios user but the airpods pro have their own set of advantages for ios users the same can be said for samsung's excellent galaxy but 2 pro earbuds and samsung galaxy device owners those buds have certain features that only galaxy owners can take advantage of including high resolution audio over bluetooth if you have the right setup but again the quietcomfort earbuds 2 may offer a better fit for you and i do think they sound slightly better than both the galaxy butts 2 and the pixel buds pro and have better noise cancelling as i said if you can get a tight seal with these buds the noise cancelling is really impressive probably the best out there right now as always feel free to post your views in the comments section and let me know what you think about their new design and whether you think they're worth 299 dollars after what i've told you about them if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david carnoy thanks for

30,x-vuhyaiBkU,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (1st Gen) Review: 1 Year Later,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-vuhyaiBkU,2-Minute Tech Reviews, as a food delivery driver I've been a power user of the original Bose quiet Comfort earbuds for over a year and although they debuted roughly two years ago I'm gonna go through why they're still worth it even in 2022. this review isn't going to go over Spec's Northern nitty-gritty details of the earbuds rather this is going to be more of my real world experience what I like and don't like about these so without further Ado let's get into it the earbuds itself is housed in a thick case I don't mind the chunky case because normally it just sits in the front storage area of my car you can also throw them in a backpack or purse without much fuss however if you want something pocketable these aren't the best option I mean you can have the case in your pocket if you often wear more loose fitting clothes like gym shorts or sweatpants but if you're a skinny jeans type person it'll definitely be noticeable as for the material the case and earbuds are made up of a hard plastic I actually like the material because it seems to be more durable and less prone to scuffs and scratches even when it's getting tossed around in a bag the ear tip are made up of a soft silicone and they feel surprisingly nice speaking of comfort the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds are aesthetically not the most attractive they look like very large pills my grandma used to take every morning and since they do protrude out of your ears a considerable amount you'd assume they'd hurt like hell after a short while right well you'd be wrong I believe the combination of the soft silicone and wingtip design the earbuds feel secure and I can wear them an entire battery cycle without my ears fatiguing which can range anywhere between five to six hours now are these the most comfortable Bluetooth wireless earbuds I've ever tried I'd say the airpods pro takes the championship Comfort belt to the point where I often forget they're in my ear holes however the comfortability of these both earbuds certainly isn't a negative now let's touch on battery life when the earbuds are fully charged they can last up to six hours and I can attest to this even in my use case even after using it practically day in and day out for over a year battery life has remained consistent between have five to six hour mark depending on how long I've had active noise cancellation turned on the case itself can provide an additional two full charges of extra battery life and if you slap the earbuds in the case for just 15 minutes you get two hours of play time the thick case can be charged via USBC or a Qi wireless charging pad which are both convenient options to have okay I need to preface this part by stating I'm not a psycho audio file this opinion is coming from a dude with novice ears also I admittedly haven't tried every Bluetooth wireless earbuds out there especially the Sony watchma college or the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds too but these are the best sounding Bluetooth wireless earbuds I've ever tried the active noise cancellation alone is the sole reason why they're still worth it even in 2022. for instance if I'm on the road doing deliveries for eight plus hours I'm forced to switch between either the Beats fit Pro or the airpods pro while I'm giving juice to the Bose earbuds the QuietComfort earbuds has a much richer sound and the active noise cancellation is far superior in comparison they eliminate a lot of the external noise where I don't have to max out the volume when I'm jamming out to a Spotify playlist I should also mention that I've been testing out the brand new airpods Pro 2 for the past few days and though they sound way better than the original version the active noise cancellation on the airpods Pro 2 isn't noticeably better than these that's pretty amazing considering these came out more than two years ago as for traveling I do prefer over ear headphones like my airpods Max to really drown out that crying baby sitting next to me on the plane but the quiet Comforts are a solid alternative if you prefer to travel light while still experiencing world-class active noise cancellation lastly the transparency mode they're not as good as the airpods pro where the sound coming from the outside sounds so freaking natural but at least the Bose earbuds doesn't sound like you're stuck in a Campbell's Soup can it honestly sounds like if you had a small piece of Kleenex tissue stuck in your ear when I first bought the earbuds they were crippled by the Bose app there just wasn't a lot of customizations you could do here are a few notable software improvements that were made since I purchased it though you can now adjust volume up and down by swiping on the right earbud why this wasn't a built-in feature I have no clue I also love you can refine your equalizer settings based on your listening preferences Bose also added modes where you can adjust the level of noise cancellation whether you're at the gym office or on your commute and the last thing worth mentioning is that Bose has added active sense according to Bulls the purpose of active sense is that if things get too loud the earbuds automatically adjust the amount of noise cancellation so you can enjoy your music comfortably I tried this feature out for a few days while doing food deliveries and it's not for me I mean I get why they added it you want to save your ear holes from Extremely Loud Noises in your surroundings like construction or an ambulance risen by you my biggest gripe with active sense is when I'm in transparency mode and I'm having a conversation with another human being active sense picks up voices and increases the noise cancellation level making it really difficult to hear what the other person is saying I might be a dumb dumb but doesn't this defeat the purpose of transparency mode I hope in a future software update both corrects this until then I'll just leave active sense off other than me having no use for active sense I do appreciate all of the other software updates Bose has added to make these earbuds way more versatile okay I do have to mention another nitpick touch controls call me old school but for Bluetooth wireless earbuds I prefer having some form of button I'll love the Beats fit Pro or airpods Pro unfortunately there are no buttons on the Bose quiet Comforts and it's all controlled via touch you double tap the right earbud to play Slash pause to toggle through your various noise cancellation modes you have to double tap the left earbud and lastly I customize holding down the left earbud to skip to the next track I may be in the minority but constantly tap tap tapping on my eardrum does get old after a while these earbuds are bigger than most so why couldn't Bulls add a teeny tiny button somewhere on here that would have been amazing now are these earbuds good for working out or going to the gym personally I'd say yes and no the earbuds have an ipx4 rating for water resistance this means the earbuds should be fine during sweaty workouts or in light rain however though you can use them on long runs they're a bit too big and bulky for my liking plus I don't need Superior noise cancellation on runs as I like to be more aware of my surroundings anyway I would lean more towards something smaller like the Beats fit Pro if you're going to use it primarily for extensive runs if you're just at the gym on the other hand these would be great you can have a more immersive gym going experience blocking out all the grunts and heavy breathing from the folks around you so finally are these still worth it in 2022 I mean I already spoiled the answer in the intro but at the original 279 dollar price point I don't think it is at the time of filming this however you can cop them at a reduced price from either Best Buy or Amazon for 199 at 199 I can wholeheartedly recommend them over the past year the Bull's quiet Comfort earbuds was my most used electronic device other than my iPhone although the case is chunkier than I'd like and the giant pill-shaped earbuds are admittedly not the most attractive or comfortable compared to some of the other bluetooth earbuds I've tried these minor issues are overcome by how great they sound and the fact that Bose has improved the earbuds immensely making them more usable via upgraded software so if you're in the market for a great sounding pair of Bluetooth wireless earbuds but aren't willing to Shell out the cash for the latest and greatest you certainly won't be disappointed in these well that's it for me thanks for watching like comment subscribe and I'll see you then foreign [Music],Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds,I've been a power user of the original Bose quiet Comfort earbuds for over a year.Battery life has remained consistent between have five to six hour mark depending on how long I've had active noise cancellation turned on the case itself can provide an additional two full charges of extra battery life.These are the best sounding Bluetooth wireless earbuds I've ever tried the active noise cancellation alone is the sole reason why they're still worth it even in 2022. The Bull's quiet Comfort earbuds were my most used electronic device other than my iPhone.There are no buttons on the Bose quiet Comforts and it's all controlled via touch you double tap the right earbud to play Slash pause to toggle through your various noise cancellation modes.The earbuds should be fine during sweaty workouts or in light rain however you can use them on long runs they're a bit too big and bulky for my liking.
31,jcpb_Pr0XHE,Bose QuietComfort Earbuds Review - Should you buy them?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcpb_Pr0XHE,RTINGS com, hi i'm daigo from rainies.com today we'll be doing a review of the bose quiet comfort earbuds we'll be evaluating it on our standardized test bench to see how it performs and if you should buy it the bosque comfort earbuds are both first foray into truly wireless noise cancelling earbuds they offer a solid alternative to both this well-known over-ears qc45 with a lighter more portable design their noise canceling is great too and they come in a few sleek colors to suit your style the bose qc earbuds have a great build quality they're mostly made of plastic with silicone ear tips and fins they're also certified ipx4 for resistance against splashes of water so they can handle a walk in the park without an issue they come with three differently sized silicone ear tips to help you get the best fit the ear tips don't go too deeply in your ear which makes them comfy enough if you wear them for a long period of time the tips also have stability fins integrated into their design they're very flexible and help keep them from falling out of your ear when you're on the go however for in-ear headphones they have a bulky plastic body that sticks out of your ear each bud has a touch sensitive surface it's somewhat easy to use but it can be tricky to register a slight touch if you want to adjust the volume alongside basic calls and music controls you can also cycle between up to four different anc modes you can also select which anc mode you can access via their companion app on the downside they lack track skipping controls these headphones also come with a carrying case although it's a bit bulky it has a lock to keep the buds from falling out of it there's also a row of lights to indicate the case's battery life and a usbc port for recharging the case now let's take a look at the tests we'll start with sound for our test we use their default sound profile and smoke silicone ear tips and turn the anc to high our raw frequency response graph measures how accurately the headphones reproduce each frequency in terms of amplitude to measure frequency response we use five different measurements to account for different fits and positionings across users for in-ears earbuds like the bose qc earbuds these measurements are only done on our dummy head their design also means that there isn't much deviation in frequency response either so long as you get a good fit in comparison the sum profile curve shows the differences between the measured frequency response and our target this makes it easier to see characteristics like over emphasize space or travel this target is chosen based on research by harman to be one that most people prefer the bose have a flat sound profile that follows our target response very well mixes have a touch of extra thump rumble and boom but it doesn't overwhelm the rest of your audio their sound is suitable for a variety of audio content although some users may find vocals and lead instruments a bit bright luckily their companion app has a three band graphic eq plus presets to help you adjust their sound when you're listening to audio at high volumes there's a chance you may encounter unwanted distortion which can affect the fidelity of your sound luckily the bose have a great performance at high volumes so your audio sounds clear and pure as we come to expect from other bose headphones like the qc35 or 45 they have great noise isolation performance thanks to their active noise cancelling system each mode delivers a different amount of noise isolation their highest setting is quiet mode whether you're commuting to work or traveling by jet they do an excellent job at cutting down bass range noise such as engine rumbles they're also able to reduce ambient chatter well so you can focus on your audio rather than the office chatter they do a great job at isolating you from high pitched noise like the hum of an ac unit if you like to listen to audio at high volumes you may not want others around you to hear it luckily most of the leakage is concentrated in the treble range and escaping audio sound is thin it also falls below the noise floor of an average office so you don't need to worry about bothering co-workers or passengers if you are cranking up your favorite tunes the bose qc earbuds have an integrated mic since it sits far away from your mouth the mic has just an okay recording quality your voice sounds bright but it's a little staticky and unnatural noise handling is how well the mic separates your voice from background noises the mic has an always on noise gate which automatically cuts down ambient noise when you're not talking while you should have no problem being heard clearly if you're calling from a quiet space the mic has a lot of trouble separating your voice from moderate ambient noise if you're making a call from a busy street your voice may be drowned out the bose qc earbuds have a decent battery performance they're advertised to last roughly six hours continuously and we measured slightly over than that while it may not be enough to get you through your nine to five working day without pausing or recharging them again their carrying case holds two additional charges this brings their total battery life to just under 22 hours you can also just use one bud while the other one charges but the procedure is a little bit tricky at first if you're charging the left bud the case lid needs to be closed if you're charging the right bud the lid must be open however battery life can vary depending on your usage these buds are compatible with the bose music app on ios and android devices this app is a successor to the bose connect app and it offers new features like the 3-band graphic eq plus presets that you can use to customize their sound you can check the battery life adjust the volume level and remap controls there's also a self-voice feedback feature it allows you to hear your voice during a call unlike the bose qc35 the qc earbuds don't support multi-device pairing so you won't be able to connect to your laptop and smartphone at the same time they also don't support nfc pairing for quick pairing with nfc enabled devices if you like to stream videos or game via bluetooth you'll want to take latency into account its measured of delay and high value can indicate that your audio and visuals will be out of sync they have somewhat of a high latency on pc resulting in delay between your audio and visuals however their latency on ios and android devices is much slower so audio lag shouldn't be an issue if you're streaming videos keep in mind that some apps and devices compensate for latency differently though so this brings us to the main question should you buy these earbuds if you commute a lot to work and if you travel a lot these earbuds can be a great choice their anc helps cut down background noise while their portable design makes it easy to store away when not in use that said if you're looking for even more noise isolation the bose quiet comfort 45s and sony wh-1000xm4s are a solid choice if you don't mind an over ear fit while both headphones are much bulkier than the bose qc earbuds by design they have significantly better noise isolation performance they also have a longer continuous battery life so you don't need to charge them to make it through a long flight you may also prefer the sony's over the bose qc45s if you want customization features unlike the sony the qc45s don't have graphic eqs or presets to adjust their sound if you prefer an in-ear fit and you're a diehard apple fan check out the apple airpods pro their design offer a unique benefit to ios users such as the h1 chip for seamless pairing with your apple devices they also support spatial audio a feature which can help improve the immersiveness of your audio if the price of the bose or the apple is too steep then you should check out the anker soundcore live p3 truly wireless these wallet-friendly in-ears have an anc system with modes that you can select to best suit the noise around you they're also less bulky than the bose and have more comfortable fit however their continuous battery life is much shorter so you may need to recharge them to last through a long flight

32,XdpfyVXgUWo,NEW Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds [Best ANC I Ever Tested!],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdpfyVXgUWo,Mike O'Brien, this is the latest Flagship pair of earbuds from Bose and the name says it all these are the quiet Comfort Ultra earbud which is a pretty bold claim I know but honestly I would love to have a pair of ultra comfortable earbuds with ultra quiet AMC when I travel when I work or really whatever so let's unpack that starting off with the Quiet part spoiler ultra quiet is not an exaggeration but before we get into the test I'm actually filming this before these earbuds hit the shelves so I want to thank Bose for sending these over early and for partnering in this video of course all opinions are my own and we'll keep things objective and factual with real testing throughout this video so starting off with the active noise cancellation test the way I do this is by playing the sound of a jet at a set distance away and I turn that volume up until the earbuds are no longer able to block that out so higher number means quieter earbuds and as you can see in this chart these are the quietest earbuds I've ever tested blocking up to 65.2 decibels which was absolutely incredible I've also tried this in real world so situations flying with this other loud Ambient sound and it blocks everything so so well but of course noise cancellation is not one dimensional we also need to think about higher pitch sounds and crowd sounds and and different noises and so I ran those tests I'll show them on screen right here as well in general across the board very very impressive but without a doubt the bread and butter of these earbuds is going to be those constant loud noises like a jet a train an air conditioner whatever it's going to be very quiet from that aspect with these earbuds the second test I did was with regards to the wind a lot of earbuds struggle when you're outside and it's windy the microphones kind of feed that back in the ANC but with these I mean I was actually very impressed now you can't turn the ANC off it's always on on some spectrum between a and c and transparency and I'll show you that in the app in a second but the mic overall did a really impressive job of really shutting down the wind and I think the microphone test in just a few minutes will demonstrate that as well so as I I said I like to use these when I'm traveling and ANC is fantastic but all of that is completely worthless if they aren't comfortable so being that these are called The Quiet Comfort we better hope they are comfortable and let's unpack that a little bit so everybody has different ears but Bose understands that we have three pairs of ear tips and three pairs of wing tips giving you nine different like a permutation of nine I believe nine different setups you could have there so for me I was actually of a full disclosure last time we had the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds too the Second Generation generation from last year they were comfortable but they didn't stay in my ears well like I really couldn't wear them for a long period of time and I don't know exactly what bows changed here but these are definitely a lot better they feel more comfortable than the twos they stay in my ears for a longer period of time without falling out without getting uncomfortable um and so I was happy to see that so so far quiet Comfort is is a pretty fitting name but of course we have a few more things we have to test you can't just have quiet and comfortable earbuds obviously the sound is going to matter a lot and so these once again took it a step further than the previous generation these are Snapdragon sound certified which means one of my biggest complaints from the twos was that they only had SBC and AAC codecs this now has Qualcomm appdx adaptive which means you're getting lower latency so like less lag in the earbuds and you're getting higher resolution sound no not every phone has aptx adaptive my pixel fold didn't but my nothing phone 2 did so I was using that and the sound quality especially when you have aptx adaptive on was actually really nice like I really was impressed by the sound profile on these there was plenty capable bass and sub bass having pretty large drivers in here it's also a warm and pleasant sound it's a definitely a lot more detailed than the previous generation it can be a bit boomy by default so I use the EQ in the app which definitely helped with that and for many genres like the boomy sound would be ideal anyway but for what I was listening to I wanted to dial that back and the EQ really allowed me to do that so for example I listened to the War on Drugs just to kind of test it out it's they have a lot of music that has a lot of layers and just tons of stuff going on and the Ultras kept up they made it feel like I was pretty much there as Dynamic it was Lively so following that thread of traveling you obviously need a better battery life to last the whole flight like here in the US any flight across the country is is probably about six hours or less so I think that's really a threshold of what I would need and these hit that Target with up to six hours in the earbuds and 24 hours when you include the case and that is with active noise cancellation on a lot of earbuds present their numbers with ANC off but that's not the case with Bose but they do actually have a shorter battery life if you turn on immersion you get four hours in the earbuds and 16 when you include the case when you have immersion on which I realize I haven't actually introduced that that's one of the big new features this could really be useful in like a workday so if we're shifting gears out of travel mode into like how well do these perform when you're like working at your desk so immersion is going to be better for like videos or music and it kind of gives you like a spatial 3D surround sound so the music's gonna play like right in front of you and as you turn like it'll sound like it stays right there it's something that is new to Bose and it's actually very impressive they did a great job with this it's a feature that I don't personally use all that often but I know a lot of people really like this especially for watching videos and things like that you can actually set up different modes for different situations by the way in the Bose app so the defaults include quiet which is just plain block everything out don't turn on immersion that's the one I usually use especially when I'm traveling gives you a decent battery life of six hours and you're blocking out a lot of sound around you the second mode is immersive which by default they have it as ANC and they have like the the immersion mode where you can track your head and the third one is where when you can just hear things around you some people call it transparency some people call it here through pass-through whatever and again I was actually genuinely really impressed by this so I don't know of a good way to quantify this but when you're wearing these it really feels and sounds like you don't have anything in your ears which is really tough to do besides these the airpods are the only one that can do anything like this most other earbuds on the market just sound kind of robotic or further away or quieter these like I could walk around I could talk to people I can do daily tasks and it sounds like I'm not wearing earbuds at all and let's be honest when you're working at home like I'll wear whatever I don't care what I look like but when I'm in the office you need earbuds that look good so you can leave a comment and let me know what you think of these earbuds but in general they're a similar size and shape and overall design to the the previous generation the twos but we do have two colors available and we have a new metallic finish on the outside that looks really clean and and honestly pretty premium so let me know what you think of the Aesthetics of these overall I think look pretty good we have a very familiar case here charging by USB type-c or wireless charging it's very open design on the inside so it's easy to clean which I found beneficial and getting back to kind of the workday setup another thing is is getting on phone calls so let's actually get into a microphone test all right so the first microphone test for indoors obviously in my studio I always like to do one in acquired environment to simulate maybe where you'd be on a work call so this is what it would sound like leave a comment and let me know how this sounds to you and now let's go outside to a louder environment we can test out the wind like I said as well as some other more Ambient sound all right so here's a microphone class near a road it's pretty Breezy out here there's definitely some traffic behind me so leave a comment and let me know how these sound to you so as you can tell these are pretty ideal for a workday and they check basically every box I had except one but Bose thought about this and they have their own work around here so these don't have a true multi-point connectivity I mean meaning you can connect to multiple devices but not simultaneously and the work around here is in the Bose app you can actually go to source and you can switch between many different devices by toggling them on and off and just switching between which devices are connected to the earbuds and while we're actually in the Apple I'll show you the other things Bose has here so one the volume controls of course are available in the app we also have source as I showed you we have immersive audio you can choose if you want that to be off if you want it to be a single point in front of you or if you want motion meaning like as you turn if you're facing this way it'll kind of slowly come over there and it's always feeling like it's kind of in front of you we also have a shortcut so you can choose what the the touch and hold on either side is so it can cycle through the modes it can change immersive on and off or you could access your voice assistant of course we have a three band equalizer and then we have modes now let's actually make a new mode right now this is a really cool feature probably the one that I use the most in the app so if we go to modes there's a lot of different suggested titles you can make a custom on if you wanted but let's just say we wanted a run so if we tap on run you can choose the noise cancellation so right now it's in the middle that's equivalent to having ANC off although the engine never really turns off so that's what's cool about Bose it's always running no matter what so we can go all the way down on noise cancellation and it's just like full transparency I hear my surroundings or you can turn it all the way up and it's like I feel like I'm yelling now I really can't hear anything let's go back down and then you can also choose what the immersive audio thing is so maybe when I'm working out I want to block out a little bit of sound but I want to be able to hear like if a car beeps at me or something so maybe I'll keep it around like level two or level three that might be ideal and we can save that we could say done and now we have that mode ready to go whenever we go for a run we just tap that and those settings are ready to go now speaking of working out these also have ipx4 water resistance they also have Bluetooth 5.3 so if you're in a gym the range should be relay deal it also means they work independently without the classic Master Slave connection that we used to have in the previous generation so I could listen to Just One earbud while the other one is in the case in addition these have in-ear detection so if you take an earbud out it'll automatically pause and the touch controls as I said before work really well you have a nice large surface area not only the tap but also to swipe so you can control the volume now these are starting at 299 dollars I'll have a link down below so you can check the latest price and on that link you can actually find some other accessories which I think is really cool that Bose sells these you can buy just the case so if you lost the case or if you wanted a second case uh whatever you can buy just the case you can also buy other sizes for the ear tips so if these three for the wingtip and three for the ear tip don't fit you for some reason I think they should fit I think they should fit like 95 percent of people but if you're a like an extreme outlier you could buy some of the other sizes or you can actually buy a case cover as well so again thanks to Bose for partnering on this video I'm really stoked about these earbuds and I'm definitely going to be comparing them to the Sony xm5s the latest airpods Pro and all the other Flagship earbuds out there to see which one is really the best of the best if you want to see that video be sure to go down and click that subscribe button and if the video is already out I'll link that I'll link that right here so you can watch that now,Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds,This is the latest Flagship pair of earbuds from Bose and the name says it all these are the quiet Comfort Ultra earbud. honestly I would love to have a pair of ultra comfortable earbuds with ultra quiet AMC when I travel when I work or really whatever.The active noise cancellation test the way I do this is by playing the sound of a jet at a set distance away and I turn that volume up until the earbuds are no longer able to block that out.The microphone test in just a few minutes will demonstrate that as well. Bose's new earbuds come in two colors and come with a case.The earbuds come with ANC noise cancellation and immersion mode. immersion mode lets you track your head and hear things around you.The case comes with USB type-c or wireless charging. The Bose earbuds come in three sizes for the ear tips and three sizes for the wingtip.They also have in-ear detection so if you take an earbud out it'll automatically pause and the touch controls.They also have Bluetooth 5.3 so if you're in a gym the range should be relay deal.
33,1hGg-fHIzGM,NEW BOSE QUIET-COMFORT Earbuds With ANC - (A BIG Product),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hGg-fHIzGM,Mike O'Brien, welcome back to the channel right here we have some brand new wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation these are the bose quiet comforts and these are especially exciting because for quite a few years now bose has been making one of the best pairs of active noise cancelling headphones so for example just go on any plane ever if you're flying somewhere and you sit down on a jet and you look around i can almost guarantee that you'll see at least a couple people on the plane wearing bows over ear headphones because honestly they've had some of the best active noise cancellation and so now that they're bringing it down to a pair of earbuds here i'm really excited to test this out for you guys in this video and show you just how good or bad these earbuds actually are now i've been using these earbuds for probably about two weeks now and we have a lot to talk about i found some really good things as well as some not so good things i want to talk about in this video but let's start off with the physical design of these earbuds now starting off with the good things of the physical design i really like the way these charge these have qi wireless charging on the bottom which means when you're traveling or whatever you can just have the same wireless charger that charges your phone and you can set these on there and they charge it's a great feature to have on top of that on the back we have usb type-c so if you prefer cable charging you have that just as well now the battery life on these when you're talking about charging like the battery life is pretty good actually you're getting six hours per earbud in 18 total hours including the case it's definitely not leading the pack but that's more than enough for most use for my experience now the next thing to talk about is actually kind of a pro and a con here the way these open is something that i'm not really fond of it doesn't give you a great user experience but i understand why they did this and this is the button on the front so a lot of other earbuds have just a magnet there and you just kind of flip it open it's really satisfying really easy to do and for the most part it's secure and it works but the problem with that is when you drop it they always fling open and the earbuds fly all over the floor and in some situations that's a good way to lose your earbuds so now let's take a look at what's inside the case here first of all when you're pushing the button you want to make sure you push it in the middle and far enough in because otherwise it doesn't open and i find that again this is why i like magnets better but looking at the earbuds they're going to blink blue at first when they're trying to pair with your phone and then once they're connected they will both have the white led showing it's a very good indicator and i like having that there in the middle we have a button that button is going to allow you to pair with other devices so if you press and hold that you can connect to your laptop or your phone or whatever you're trying to set up then when we take the earbuds out they're clearly pretty large earbuds and we're going to talk more about the size of everything here in a second but the earbuds are similar in size to the sony earbuds which i found were really uncomfortable which gave me the concern here that i thought maybe these were going to fall out when i'm running maybe they wouldn't be comfortable but to my surprise they're actually they fit really well and they're really comfortable so we have three different silicone tips here and each one has a different size silicone tip that goes in your ear and a different size silicone wing tip that holds it in your ear and i find that that combination as long as you find the right size it fits really well and it doesn't fall out so i've gone for runs with these and they don't fall out so you can see if i stick it in and i twist like that you can shake your head as much as you want [Music] and and and they don't fall out now with that being said if you're running and you're on mild like five or six and your ears are your whole head's really sweaty like it's going to be harder for it to stay in and it might slide out a little bit but there's not really a pair of earbuds that wouldn't do that now speaking of sweat however the good thing about these earbuds is they are ipx4 water resistant which means that if you're sweating or if it's rainy you shouldn't have to worry about these taking on damage the only difference in really what you'll notice from getting them wet is that the touch pads on the outside don't really work well if your hands are sweaty or if it's if it's wet on the outside and i love having touch pads on earbuds if it's done correctly but i found that bose for some reason didn't give me all the controls that i was really looking for and so i'll talk about first what these can do and then i'll talk about what they can't do so see if you can identify them here what they can do first of all is on the left side if you double tap it'll cycle through different levels of active noise cancellation including a transparency mode which is really nice and then you can tap and hold and that is going to skip to the next song now on the right earbud you can double tap and that's going to play or pause and that'll do something else like it'll answer calls as well and then if you tap and hold that it'll also it'll summon your voice assistant but unfortunately that's it and if you guys noticed from those four commands i said right there one of them is actually customizable but it doesn't really get it only gives you one other option none of them allow you to change your volume and none of them allow you to skip to the previous song all right so now i think it's time we talk about the elephant in the room the size of these earbuds i mean this case is absolutely humongous i've seen so many other earbud cases out there and honestly i gave the sennheiser momentum true wireless twos i gave them a hard time about the case size because compared to the air pods and the galaxy buds and like the jabra elite active 75 ts like they all have really really tiny cases the sennheiser's was much larger and i said hey it doesn't even fit in your tiny pocket that's not good the bose case here is absolutely massive it's almost double the size of the sennheiser case and so i mean with that considered i was hoping that you'd have a longer battery life on here or or something that give you know i hope i really wanted them to do something with a large case to justify that massive size but honestly i'm not really seeing anything that makes that size worthwhile it's housing some pretty large earbuds but again i wish the earbuds would just be maybe smaller as well so that's certainly a drawback i don't like the size of this i think it kind of hinders the aesthetic a lot the earbuds themselves i'm a little bit less upset about the size because i mean they fit well and as far as aesthetic goes that's really going to be the only downside of having these large earbuds and the aesthetics of them i mean they have a white pair and a black pair and they both look pretty subtle they're a nice little matte finish on there so i don't think the aesthetics look that bad they're just i mean the size it would be nice if they were smaller actually speaking of what these earbuds have if we look at the inside besides the silicone piece there you also have a proximity sensor which is a really nice feature to have it'll detect when it's in or out of your ear which is great for automatically answering phone calls or playing and pausing music automatically on top of that we have microphones but the microphones are really only used on the right earbud because these are using a master slave connection which means you can never just listen to the left earbud actually with that being said we have a couple microphones on there so let's jump into a microphone test now to see how good these actually sound all right so guys this is a microphone test to see what they sound like indoors again with the bose quietcomfort earbuds so let me know how these sound and we're gonna head outside and see what they sound like there and now for reference these are the galaxy buds plus just to see what the microphone sounds like in comparison here generally the galaxy buds plus are considered to have a really good microphone for earbuds all right now this is what these earbuds sound like when i'm in a loud environment so there's obviously a road behind me plenty of traffic plenty of noise there so comment down below and let me know if you can hear what i'm saying all right so now getting into an analysis of the sound quality and the anc starting off the anc i think it actually does exceptionally well when it's windy outside which is surprising i know a lot of other earbuds if it's windy they start kind of feeding back and giving us like a really loud hissing sound on the inside and that's definitely a drawback but these i think did an excellent job they blocked out the wind and they blocked out everything else around you so in every environment i was very impressed with the anc for these now it is actually very powerful and has a really clean cut and i think the anc overall it didn't seem to hinder the audio quality from my testing and i think it just was really comfortable it didn't give you too much pressure feeling inside your ear and with 10 different levels it was easy to adapt to whatever environment you're in so if you're on a really loud jet i crank that all the way up at level 10 i mean it cuts out just about everything the other thing that these do that i wish every other pair of anc earbuds did and so far the only other pair i know that does it is the air pods and that's when you put one earbud in it has transparency mode on because honestly when you take one out you're probably listening to somebody and when you put both in it starts with transparency mode and then it kicks in with anc so having that little that the difference right there gives people the perceived like relief from the outside world and i think it's just a really nice thing to have so you put them both in you hear transparency and then within like a second or half a second it just crushes everything around you it just makes it so much more obvious how much the anc is actually doing so i think that's a cool feature to have good job for bose to do that now let's actually get into some testing and i'll show you side by side it's by no means a perfect test but side by side should give you a relative idea of how powerful the anc is compared to some other competitors all right so what i'm going to do is just play some sound on my laptop it's the sound of a jet i'm going to turn the volume up until i can hear it starting off with the airpods pro so if we turn this up it looks like i start to hear it around volume 26. now with the sennheiser momentum true wireless twos i can turn it up and we don't hear the jet until probably around so it looks like about 28 to 30 somewhere between 28 and 30. and now here with the bose quiet comfort buds we turn it up until around volume 25 or 26. now keep in mind we only tested one frequency here the sound of a jet which is really where i would be using anc and in this situation they're still doing an excellent job about on par with the airpods maybe the airpods were slightly better but regardless they're doing a great job with anc and then talking about the actual sound quality itself the first thing i want to mention is that there actually is no eq in the app now i thought this was going to be a big drawback and for some people it may be but i found that listening to a bunch of different types of music these were naturally very well balanced and i was very happy with the overall eq that's already built in on these earbuds so i had no need to really change that i know some people if you listen to some really bass heavy stuff maybe you would want to crank up the bass and make it more of an unnatural profile there and you can't do that with these but for just about anybody else i think you're going to be pretty happy with the profile on these but i mean given the price point i wish they would give you an eq in the app now talking about the sound quality itself i found that overall like i said clean and balanced overall a really pleasant experience when you're listening to just about every genre out there it was able to hit bass lines like very smooth and accurate it's not the most powerful seismic bass out there but like i said it's going to be sounding pretty accurate and pretty realistic when you're listening to a lot of different studio recordings if you're listening to something like the bass line on on yonkers from from tyler the creator then you might notice that it's still hitting the low notes it's not going to be shaking your head as much so i mean that's just kind of a preference thing right there for what you're listening to now because these are kind of expensive they're like 280 dollars we have to compare them at the highest level with a lot of the other best earbuds out there and so i kind of had to compare these to the sennheiser momentum true wireless twos which in my opinion have kind of been something of the gold standard for sound quality and in comparison i noticed that even though the bose earbuds sounded really good i noticed that they were lacking a little bit of low level detail so on songs i mean i have a playlist on spotify i'll link it below the first song on there is by the fleet foxes and i chose it because it's a very acoustic song it's kind of like a little bit it's easy to get really mushy together with without perfect earbuds and i found that these kind of start to mush things together a little bit so i found that the high hats are a little bit less sharp and on top of that the guitar strings sometimes start to blend together a little bit so the clarity is definitely not perfect on these and i really noticed that because i have a tendency to start turning the volume up when i have earbuds with slightly less clarity because i'm looking for those details and i found that with these i end up turning the volume up a lot so it's definitely something i noticed with these also in comparison to the sennheiser buds i found that these are slightly less warm and full and slightly less vibrant and so i think the the combination of the clarity and the warmth gives you that vibrant tone in a lot of the music and so while these still sound really good and pretty vibrant i think in comparison directly to the sennheiser buds i still prefer the sennheiser buds for sound quality but these are definitely up there and overall the sound quality was still very impressive i think a lot of people especially non-audiophiles are going to absolutely love these earbuds they get really loud and like i said the balance on them is pretty natural and it sounds it sounds good so the last thing i want to show you guys in this video is actually the app you'll be using with these earbuds it's the bose music app and you can see right here you just tap on your earbuds and it's honestly pretty nice i like this app so you can go and adjust the volume right here with the slider you can adjust the noise cancellation the active noise cancellation and if you go to favorites that's what i was saying before how you can save three different favorite levels that if you double tap the left earbud it'll kind of toggle between them so we have favorite three is going to be absolutely no noise cancellation and it goes up to favorite one which is going to be a 10. so i think that's really nice that it has that other than that there's not a whole lot you're going to do on here you can go and change things like your shortcut like i said you either hear the battery level which i think is useless or you can skip forward that's the only thing you can customize with touch controls and other than that there's not a whole lot you'll be doing in the app all right guys so that's been it for the bose quietcomfort earbuds overall i mean i'm going to keep things real to you guys if you buy these you're going to be very happy with them they have excellent active noise cancellation they have qi wireless charging really comfortable and those 10 different levels of anc is really nice to have but other than that are these the best premium wireless earbuds out there well i made a comparison before these came out and in that comparison these sennheiser momentum true wireless twos were among the top in that list and i think when you're looking at these head to head i think the sennheisers are still my favorite pair of premium true wireless earbuds so i mean with that being said guys like i mean like i said if you buy them you're gonna love these earbuds but i'm trying to keep things real i would maybe buy the sennheisers instead they're a little more expensive but you're getting a smaller case and you're getting in my opinion better sound quality but let me know in the comments down below which one you guys think is better and why let me know what you liked about either of these earbuds and if you liked this video consider going down and liking and subscribing thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] [Music] foreign,Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds,"Bose has been making one of the best pairs of active noise cancelling headphones for quite a few years now.The battery life on these is six hours per earbud in 18 total hours including the case.The way these open is something that i'm not really fond of it doesn't give you a great user experience. ipx4 water resistant which means that if you're sweating or if it's rainy you shouldn't have to worry about these taking on damage. touch pads on the outside don't really work well if your hands are sweaty or if it's if it's wet on the outside.Bose for some reason didn't give me all the controls that i was really looking for. The anc is actually very powerful and has a really clean cut and i think the anc overall it didn't seem to hinder the audio quality from my testing.With 10 different levels it was easy to adapt to whatever environment you're in.The overall eq that's already built in on these earbuds are naturally very well balanced. In comparison to the sennheiser momentum true wireless twos, the bose earbuds are lacking a little bit of low level detail.The high hats are a little bit less sharp and on top of that the guitar strings sometimes start to blend together.The sennheisers are still my favorite pair of premium true wireless earbuds."
34,G5Gc3UiFsyM,"Beats Fit Pro review: Goodnight, AirPods Pro?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5Gc3UiFsyM,CNET, hey there so we got the airpods third generation last week but it turns out apple wasn't done for this year it owns beats and these are the new beats fit pro noise cancelling earbuds they're 200 come in four color options and they might just be better than the airpods pro and the sports airpods you've always wanted let's talk about that [Music] [Music] now the concept behind the fitzpro is pretty simple take beats iconic powerbeats pro sports buzz with its big ear hook and shrink it the hell down i can't say i ever love the powerbeats pro's design but a lot of people do because the earhook gives you a feeling of security that your buds aren't going to fall off your head i personally prefer my sports buds to have a wingtip that fits into the inside of the ear not around the outside of it and that's what we have here most of the time those wingtips or sports fins as they're sometimes called are removable and sometimes come in different sizes but what's interesting with the fit pro is that the wing tip has been integrated into the design it's one size fits all you can't replace it as far as i can tell but it does seem durable and it's made of firm but pliable silicone rubber it's soft to the touch the buds fit comfortably and securely in my ears i much prefer this design to the powerbeats pros beats earbuds have always had a physical control button which i do like and the fit pros also have one what's nice about it is that because it's an extension of the sport fin it is a soft to the touch finish and a little bit of a grip to it use it to control music playback answer and end calls and a long press switches between noise canceling and transparency modes you can also program the long press to be volume controls on the buds themselves that's a feature a lot of people have been asking for on the airpods and i do suspect it is coming very soon to the new airpods 3 and airpods pro these also have always on hey siri so you can raise and lower volume by just asking apple's voice assistant to do it and issuing other voice commands without touching a button anyway they're lightweight weighing 5.6 grams each and they fit my ears really well as i said they come in four colors and you'll see everything but the white version of this video i wore the lavender one around more because it shows up better in shots but i'd personally probably go with the gray color because i'm not a flashy guy and it kind of blends with your ears the best i'm a little surprised beats didn't go with red for launch but i'm sure you'll see more colors next year before i get into features and performance i just have a few more comments about the design the one big complaint about the powerbeats pro is their huge case the case for the fit pro isn't as small as the airpods pro case or even the beats studio buds case but it's still pretty compact and much smaller in the powerbeats pros case in a bit of a nod to android users the case charges via usbc not lightning however it's missing the wireless charging found in the airpods pro and airpods 3 cases [Music] battery life is rated at up to six hours with noise canceling on and seven hours with it off at moderate volume levels that's compared to around 4.5 hours for the airpods pro with noise canceling on and five hours with it off you can get an extra 21 hours of juice when the case is fully charged aside from the lack of wireless charging in all other respects the fit pro have the same features as the airpods pro one of the big downsides of the beats studio buds is that they don't have apple's h1 chip so they're missing things like adaptive eq that detects how the earbuds are sitting in your ears and optimizes sound on the fly along with those extra features for apple users like spatial audio and auto switching between devices on your icloud account but these have the h1 chip so you're getting an airpods pro-like experience with better sound and noise cancelling than the beats studio buds as well as a top-notch transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world in a natural way as far as i can tell the noise cancelling and transparency are at the same level as the airpods pro noise canceling isn't quite as good as sony's or boses but it's pretty close and quite effective at muffling external noise i will say this these actually sound slightly better than the airpods pro beats says they have custom 9.5 millimeter drivers and i think they have a touch more clarity and the base packs a little more punching goes a little deeper they have a pretty wide sound stage but they don't offer quite as expansive or refined sound as the more expensive sony wf-1000x mark iv buds i'm not talking about a big difference in sound quality sony just sounds slightly more natural has a touch more detail that can bring out a little bit more nuance in music tracks but i think the beats sound will impress you a lot it's good and these avoid distorting at higher volumes which probably has as much to do with the adaptive eq as the drivers themselves of course just how good a noise ice clinging earbud sounds is depending on how good a fit you get i'll just point out that i got a decent seal with the largest size of the included tips but i ended up switching them out for my go-to sennheiser tips that tend to fit my ears best with a lot of earbuds including the sony's now starting to get a little wonkier but some companies include tips with a slightly recessed tube that's the part that attaches to the earbuds post but the sennheiser's tube is flush with the outer rim of the tip so once you put it on the post the tip extends out from the bud a few millimeters more those few millimeters and the shape of the sennheiser tips created a perfect seal in my ears with these earbuds to be clear the beats tips fit my ears well and they should fit most people's ears well but i'm looking for the perfect fit when i test bud so i can get the optimal performance for sound quality as well as noise cancelling which can suffer if you don't get a tight seal i can't tell you how boring your tips are they can make or break an earbud and i just wanted to put in a video how subtle design difference can make an impact but it's nice that unlike with the airpods pro which have a custom tip design that you can basically swap in any tips with these like the airpods pro these beats have ear detection sensors and enhanced find my feature with proximity view that helps locate your buds in all those places they like to hide i'm not going to talk much about apple's new spatial audio feature with head tracking other than to say that it's a nice bonus feature it allows you to get virtual surround sound when you're watching movies and tv shows on various apple devices like i said in my airpods 3 review it's a neat effect with video watching but a bit more hit or miss with apple music tracks with dolby atmos it also now works with group facetime calls which is kind of cool the beats fit pro will pair with most other bluetooth audio devices but you'll lose all the extra features like spatial audio and always on hey siri and audio sharing with other people who have airpods however unlike the airpods beats has an app for android devices that makes their buds slightly more friendly to android users at least it's making some effort to appeal to android users from an android perspective the good thing about the beats studio buzz not having an h1 chip was that except for always on hey siri it didn't have those extra apple only features so you didn't feel like you were missing out on anything in this case you are but android users still might consider these thanks to their design strong sound good noise canceling and excellent transparency mode and also good voice calling performance how much backup can't really hear a whole lot of background noise but it seems like when you have a conversation or when you start to speak your the microphones are not picking up your voice that well so you kind of seem faint in the kind of your voice is very low yes they are better than the studio buds and powerbeats pro for making calls but not quite as good as the airpods third generation or airpods pro at least not right now according to beats they have six microphones up to five of which that are used during calls there's a voice accelerometer that helps isolate your voice and a wind mitigation system in my torture tests in the streets of new york they did a decent job reducing background noise but there were some subtle differences between these and the airpods pro the airpods third generation some people said they heard slightly more background noise with the beats and didn't think my voice came across quite as clearly with the noise cancelling on i could hear everyone quite well so no complaints on my end it's quite possible we get some improvements with firmware upgrades but for now i'd have to say these are good for voice calling but a slight step behind both the airpods third generation and airpods pro that said for me the beats fit pro came out as the winner over the airpods pro and are the sporty airpods i've always wanted i like the airpods pro a lot and have no problem keeping them in my ears you can also see how some people like the familiar pipe design of the airpods pro with their now shorter stems and not everybody likes having the beats be splashed across their earbuds but the fit pro really do lock in your ears if you get a tight seal they sound slightly better and have equally good noise canceling their battery life is also a little better it will be interesting to see how much these hurt sales of the beats studio buzz in airpods pro they're hard to compare to the airpods third generation because if you're getting those you're getting them for their open design but i do think you'll see the hundred fifty dollar studio buds on sale more frequently selling for twenty to thirty dollars off and maybe even approaching a hundred dollars while the airpods pro lists for 250 they sell for around 200 and sometimes less online so they're basically the same price as the beats fit pro i guess apple wins either way if you buy one or the other but it's funny to see two models from the same company competing directly with each other maybe it will bring out the best in apple and the airpods pro 2 will be that much better when they arrive perhaps as soon as next year but let me know what you guys think sound off in

35,tQPLL3eE2e8,NEW Beats Fit Pro Buds Unboxing &amp; Review!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQPLL3eE2e8,UrAvgConsumer, what's going on guys drivers consumer and today we've got a new pair of beats let me introduce you to the beats fit pro so these are new earbuds by beets it feels like they just came out with the beats studio buds right it wasn't that long ago but either way we got new beats over here and these i really like but first let's talk about what you get in the box when you pick it up so of course everything comes in a tiny black box around the box you get a little bit of information about what you get inside as well as some of the new features coming to the earbuds but we want to see what's inside and once you pop it open you'll immediately be greeted by the earbuds themselves inside of their case of course but once you pop that case out you'll see it gives you a little tip on how to go ahead and pair it but once you get past that you get some of the accessories in the back of this package you'll see some of the paperwork that it comes with you even get a three month trial of apple music included as well as a beat sticker and some other stuff but back to the accessories you get a pretty short usbc cable and to the left of that you'll get your ear tips so you've got small and large here in case the medium ones that are included on the earbuds don't work out for you but going back to the case it actually reminds me of the powerbeats pro but it's actually a lot thinner and when you open them up you got the earbuds and here you have it you guys these are the beats fit pro but first let's talk about the design let's talk about how these actually look how they fit like i said that case it's actually pretty flat carl you got your powerbeats pro case on you on me no it's too big that's why i don't carry it with me okay fair uh but these are a lot smaller than the powerbeats pro case you might like this car i'll feel that okay felt like i just passed anywho we're talking about the beats bit pro right now these look very similar to the beat studio buds you've got the small bud over here and you've got that b on this like oval shape so that it's very easy to grab pop it in and out this is a good design and now obviously it has that new wing tip and this is supposed to allow the earbuds to of course stay in a lot better than without it so as you guys can see these wing tips kind of rest inside of the ear so when you're doing activities and movement you're jumping all around doing whatever you do it's not going to leave your ears it's going to do a really good job staying in place and from what i've seen it is really nice sometimes my air pods pro they might start to wiggle a little bit but with these i don't have to worry about that they do a really good job staying in place now i'm not the most active guy in the world i you know might do lift little weights here and there but jay come on man up here uh but from what i've noticed so far you know i could shake my head all of this earbuds would have been slipping out by now these they don't budge one thing i will say it does take some getting used to having that wingtip just kind of chill in there not gonna lie used to tickle at first so it's weird to say but it it it just it's a little sensitive you know i'm a grown med your mother tickling my ears but it's true but for me personally i'm okay with that as long as they stay in place because it is so important to have a really good seal so you get the best audio quality out of your earbuds and without having to worry about these i know i'm getting the best that i can so in terms of looks guys what are we what are we saying clean clean i like it now these actually come in four different colors they come in black sage gray stone purple and white i'm not gonna lie after seeing the white one i was like did i make the right choice i mean black goes with everything but that white looks super clean i kind of kind of feel like i missed out but you can't have them all right now beyond the wingtip what else did beets add what other features are there well first and probably the most important thing is these have apple's h1 chip so if you're familiar with like air pods like the airpods 3 airpods pro that's the chip that powers those and allows all kinds of cool features like being able to speak to the earbuds by saying hey siri it also allows it to connect to your icloud account whatever your apple devices may be it'll automatically switch between them without you having to press pretty much anything so if i'm playing a song right here and then i pause it and i start playing something on that imac is automatically going to send the audio straight to the earbuds without touching anything so if you're in the apple ecosystem these are going to fit right in unlike the beats studio buds that had a different kind of chip this is going to work perfectly now even though this is fully integrated with the apple ecosystem the android operating system isn't being left out there's an android app that you can download that'll give you pretty much all of the features except a few like you won't be able to use the find my feature so you can find the earbuds through the find my app because that doesn't exist on android and you'll also lose out on of course the hey siri the icloud account that kind of stuff you won't get any of that but that makes sense but if you have an android device and you still want to get the beats fits pro you'll have the app that works so you can get all the features that come with it and still have a good time now these also have a feature that we just saw come to the airpods 3 and that is that skin detecting optical sensor now that's huge talked about it in our airpods 3 review if you haven't seen that i'll have it linked down below in the description but basically it has that optical sensor so it knows when it's actually in your ear now the reason why that's cool is sometimes you know you take out your earbuds and you know when you take them off your ear they automatically pause with the optical sensors it'll know when it's in your pocket or against a surface that isn't actual skin it'll work in your hand interestingly enough because it's skin but most importantly it'll only really work in your ears so that should also save on battery because it's not just playing music while in your pocket or your backpack or something and these also have active noise cancelling as well as the transparency mode that we like to see with apple's earbuds and they work very very well here transparency mode active noise cancelling very good now let's say you don't have active noise cancelling or transparency mode on you get adaptive eq it'll detect the audio that you're hearing from your ears with microphones it'll adjust the medium to low frequencies to basically give you the best audio quality to fit your ears so that mode is only going to be available when active noise cancelling and transparency mode are off but when it's in this mode it'll actually give you about seven hours of battery life and when you have the active noise canceling or transparency it'll drop it down to six so i'll just throw up the numbers so you guys can see make life easier but battery life is decent now of course these also have spatial audio i feel like we've talked about spatial audio a lot on the channel so basically what this does is with the device that you're listening to let's say it's an iphone it can detect the placement of the phone it uses the gyroscope and the accelerometer to understand your head position and the device position and you can move your head around and the audio will pretty much stay fixed so kind of like if you were speaking to someone in person it's gonna be the same sensation it's pretty wild at first you guys but it's it's really cool now there's also another side of spatial audio when it comes to music it basically creates like the spear of audio is actually pretty interesting it definitely feels more immersive so it's there you should give it a try see if you like it it's definitely going to be something a lot of people will enjoy but i'm just a fan of normal audio i do like spatial audio though for watching content i think that's really cool i can't even believe we didn't talk about this yet but of course this has a built-in button so the b is an actual button you can control all of your audio right from here like we see with any other earbuds i know a lot of you asked me judd what about the mic quality so we'll start talking about mic quality a little bit more i'll be sure to try to remember to tell you guys about that uh but the mic quality here is great uh i just got off the phone with arie and i was asking her like how does this sound she's like oh did you change like she didn't even realize that i changed to ear but she said it sounds exactly the same as speaking on the phone so that is always a good thing so while we're on the topic of like how things sound let's talk about the audio quality now these sound great to me i personally really like these they get surprisingly loud you guys uh i was crank i was just ready to crank up the volume when i first tried these on and i just kept going i was just like oh i actually got to bring it down it's not something i typically experience with truly wireless earbuds but i did feel the need to like bring the volume down kind of have it sit around like the 80 mark 80 to 90 i felt pretty comfortable with that i was very happy with the bass response that i got out of these vocals were very clear this is some really rich audio you guys i can't imagine a specific genre of music that wouldn't work well with these i've tried to throw a bunch of stuff at it and i have a wide range of music tastes you know this carl and it worked out very nicely for pretty much everything i've been doing a lot of switching i went from the airpods pro to the beats studio buds back to no to the sony wf-1000x mark fours back to the airpods pro and now i think these will really truly dethrone the airpods because i love the way they sound and the fit the fit is what's so important to me and i don't have to worry about that here so i'm very happy to have what feels like an upgrade and with these i'm not missing out any of the features that i had with the airpods pro and they come in at 200 bucks you guys cheaper than the airpods pro by 50 bucks a little bit more than the airpods three those are 179 these are 199. so 20 bucks more but i am super happy with these because you get all of those extra features like active noise canceling all that good stuff that about wraps up this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy go like give this video a thumbs up and catch you guys in the next one until then it's your average consumer peace you need to upgrade to these cars halloween what is this trick or treat for earbuds get out of here carl you gotta go,Beats Fit Pro Earbuds,The beats fit pro is a new pair of earbuds from beets.They come with a three month trial of apple music as well as a beat sticker and some other stuff.The earbuds look very similar to the beats studio buds you've got the small bud over here and you've got that b on this like oval shape so that it's very easy to grab pop it in and out.They do take some getting used to having that wingtip just kind of chill in there not gonna lie used to tickle at first. These have apple's h1 chip so if you're familiar with like air pods like the airpods 3 airpods pro that's the chip that powers those and allows all kinds of cool features like being able to speak to the earbuds.They also have an android app that you can download that'll give you pretty much all of the features except a few like you won't be able to use the find my feature.When it's in this mode it'll give you about seven hours of battery life and when it's in this mode it'll drop it down to six This earbuds come in at 200 bucks.They come in at a wide range of music tastes.The fit is what's so important to me and i don't have to worry about that here.
36,c1OoVcoahsY,The Beats Fit Pro Review - Looking for Earbuds That Won&#39;t Fall Out of Your Ears,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1OoVcoahsY,ListedFit," So i finally got my hands on a pair of beats  fit pro earbuds I'm of course going to try   them out and give you the lowdown, but the main  thing I'm going to focus on is whether the Beats   Fit Pro stay put, because I'm sick and tired  of my current earbuds the Apple Airpods Pro   falling out of my ears, so I'm going to try  them out and see how I get on with them.   If you've watched some of my other videos  on earbuds, you will know that for me   finding the right earbuds for working out isn't  always as simple as picking up the first pair that   I like to look of, they have to perform well in  the situations that I'm going to be in when I wear   them, otherwise they're useless to me. These Beats  Fit Pro will be mainly used for the gym, so I need   them to have noise-cancelling that actually works  well, to not fall out of my ears whatever I'm doing,   and to also not run out of battery halfway through  my workout. My current workout earbuds are the   Apple AirPods Pro, these are great at giving me  nice clear sound quality, I also like the noise   cancelling feature which helps to drown out some  of the noises of the other people and other things   happening around the gym when I'm trying to focus  on my workout, no other earbuds that I've tried   have been as good at drowning out outside noises  without me having to turn the volume all the way   up to a ridiculous level which of course would  be harmful to my ears over time. Now the problem   with these is that they sometimes fall out of  my ears when I do certain things such as when   I lay horizontally during bench presses or if I'm  laid out flat doing stretches or something of that   nature. To say the least, it gets annoying having  to constantly pick them up and adjust them so   I'm looking for earbuds that offer me the sound  quality that I currently have with the AirPods Pro   and to combine them with the ability to actually  stay put when I do things like bench skipping   stretching whatever it may be. In steps the Beats  Fit Pro! I actually reviewed the previous earbuds   from Beats, they were called the Beats Studio  and to be honest they were a bit of a letdown   I'll put a link in the description so you can see  that video after this one, my main gripe about the   Studio Pros was that the noise-cancelling on them  just wasn't anywhere near the level as the AirPods   Pros, so I'm really excited to see what the noise  cancelling on these Beats Fit Pro will be like.   The first thing you'll probably notice about the  Beats Fit Pro is the price, at the time of making   this video they're nearly double the price of the  Beats Studio Pros which could mean that they offer   higher quality and they have features that work  better, or that possibly they've gone back and fixed   some of the little annoyances that made the Beats  Studio a bit of a letdown, let's see now let's look   at the features that actually matter to me, the  main features that I care about is whether they   fall out of my ears when I'm working out and  I'll tell you how they fared a little later on   so the main features that set these apart from  other earbuds in the same category are the sweat   proof and water resistance, they will resist a  little bit of sweat and a little bit of water   so if you're a heavy sweater during your workout  or if you work out in light rain it shouldn't   affect the functionality of these earbuds. active  noise-cancelling to block out outside noises and   the flexible wing tips to give you more of a  secure fit and of course stop them from falling   out. There are of course other features such as  spatial audio and battery life offering you   six hours of listening time and the case acting as  a charger also. Normally when earbuds of this type   have a case it's normally a charging case as well  so I expected that from these sorts of earbuds   anyway. Now, when it came to working out with them  the Beats Fit Pro offer similar noise-cancelling   to the Apple AirPods Pro to be fair these did  a pretty good job of cancelling out the outside   sounds around me. It wasn't so strong that i wasn't  able to hear anything else, someone shouting in the   distance could still be heard, but I'd say 70%  of the sound around me was cancelled out which   is pretty effective I felt like I was in my own  little sound bubble and nobody could distract me   now the sweatproof and water-resistant ability i  do tend to get really sweaty when I train cardio   days and leg days especially my head does get a  little sweaty when i work out but not so sweaty   that my headphones will be drenched and the sound  will cut out, however when I did sweat, I didn't   notice any difference in the operation of  these earbuds. How did the battery hold up?   The battery held up fine in three weeks I only  had to charge them maybe three times and they   never completely fully lost their charge which  is really good. The thing is, when it comes to   reviewing things that run off batteries is that  batteries over the years do lose their strength   but I can say over the three weeks that i  used these the battery held up brilliantly.   Now, did they fall out of my ears? Now, the  burning question for me is whether they   fell out of my ears or not and the answer  is no they didn't fall out of my ears once   which is very impressive. Working out with these  was interesting I did everything I normally do   skipping workouts bench press stretching olympic  ring work and i didn't have to adjust them at all   once they were in they were in very impressed  that's a big improvement from the Studio Pros   that I reviewed earlier now there were a couple  of minor annoyances with these, the only couple   of minor annoyances that I would note is that  like the studio pros before them, it's very   easy to accidentally press the button on them  and pause your music but this wasn't really   much of a deal-breaker for me because they did  everything else really well. If I've helped you   in any way please leave a like on this video,  that was my review of the Beats Fit Pro earbuds   definitely an improvement on the previous pair  with a little minor annoyance that wasn't really   a deal-breaker for me. So thank you for watching  my review and I'll see you in the next one :)  ",Beats Fit Pro Earbuds,"I'm sick and tired of my current earbuds the Apple Airpods Pro falling out of my ears.I need them to have noise-cancelling that actually works well, to not fall out of my ears whatever I'm doing, and to also not run out of battery halfway through my workout.The first thing you'll probably notice about the Beats Fit Pro is the price, at the time of making this video they're nearly double the price of the Beats Studio Pros.

and know our hands-free siri alright so all of that for 200 bucks let's see what it is first things first shout out to white shoes back in the building [Music] calm down now at the end of this video i'm going to answer a couple of questions number one are these really worth 200 bucks number two where do i rank these versus my top apple earbuds number one on my list the airpod pros number two the studio buds and number three the powerbeats pro now the side note everybody always asks me what's my favorite earbuds for the gym and if you read the comments it's always the powerbeats pro and that's for one reason the air hooks these will not fall out of my ears now lately i've been trying to use the studio buds because they have anc and the power beats don't but the problem with the studio buds is they will fall out of my ears at the end of my workout now i tend to sweat a lot and at the end of my workout i'm doing my decline bench i'm doing my calisthenics and of course my 100 back flips and these will move around a little bit now anybody that works out you know one of the most annoying things in the world is when you're trying to do that last set and you sweating extra hard and you grunting and your earbuds move even just a little bit when your earbuds move that tends to mess up your whole workout so the powerbeats pro these have always been my gym buds because they will not move so now let's see if we get a new champ power beats fit uh power beats beats fit bro okay it's early in the morning y'all bear with me beats fit pro here we go okay now that was a little fail just now okay let's see if i can peel these off let me just grab a little unboxing knife so this way my angle levels don't increase okay here we go okay okay there we go let me just calm down look you see this is why sometimes you just gotta calm down and do things correctly ladies and gentlemen this is some major trolling going on by beats okay here we go okay nice black box y'all know i like that giggity okay got your little beats logo inside now these are gonna be your beats fit pro this is the case nice little uh red beats logo i like that let's see what else you get now let's see the charging on these this is going to be usb type c to usb type c let's see the length on this cable not that long that's what she said let's see anything else okay so you got your usual books and [ __ ] and of course your beach troll sticker let me go ahead and save that and let's see do we get any different size ear tips there it is all right different size air tips so it looks like small and large medium should be pre-installed that's it for that now here's your charging case let's open this up there it is beats fit pro let's take a look at the buds okay nice and small you got your wings or your fins whatever you want to call them right now these are not removable nice silicone tips just drop them back in got it on the first try and there it is all right so let me pause the video i'll grab a phone we'll pair these up and we'll start our usual testing talk amongst alright guys so we back in first just for size comparison here's the difference between all of the cases so the airpods pro smallest case then the studio buds then the fit then the powerbeats pro all right now this is a big giant case but again you got to fit those hooks in there now for the beats fit pro the charging case no wireless charge on this it is nice and lightweight matte finish so no fingerprints on the back this is a usb type-c charging slot on the front you got a little led on the inside nice and clean there's your bluetooth pairing button let's check the magnet strength let's start with minimum shake edge okay no movement intermediate shakeage no movement maximum shakeage no movement at all excellent strength on the magnets now let's take a look at the actual earbuds and for size comparison here's your airpod pros he's got the stems here's your studio buds these are the smallest here's your powerbeats pro now these are the biggest but you got the hooks and here's the fit pro now i'm curious to see how these are going to fit in my ears but you got the wings got the red beats logo okay there's all your mics all your sensors physical buttons with a nice little click real nice all right so now let's check the pairing process first we'll start off with an android phone so we'll just open these up there's your prompt hit pair and there it is just like that now let's go through some of the features real quick you can rename these here's your product serial number firmware register simple enough now let's pair them up with an iphone let's open these up hit connect hold the button and there it is connecting okay so let's take the little uh tutorial media controls just like that that was a little tutorial all right hit done and you're all set all right so now let's put the name to the test these are the beats fit pro let's see how they fit how they feel and how they look all right so i'm going to slap them with my ears okay adjusting the little wingtips it's a nice snug tight comfortable fit i must have on transparency mode because i can hear myself perfectly fine and any earbuds that have fit in the name we can't just test for maximum shakeage we're gonna have to step it up to ludicrous shakeage so let me make sure these are in nice and tight okay let's start off with minimum shakeage okay no movement at all intermediate shakeage no movement here it goes maximum shaking no movement and my hat just flew off now let's take it up to ludicrous shakeage okay here we go okay my hair just came down everything came down literally no movement at all so ladies and gentlemen i'm pretty safe to say that it's over for my power beats pro let me show you how these look all right so here's how they're going to look in your ears you see how that ring is right in my ear hole my ear canal which i call it the air ball right in my ear ball these are not moving at all now i'm gonna do a little bit more vigorous testing but i did maximum and ludicrous shakeage and these did not move one inch so they're living up to the name the fit pro these fit pro okay one more thing now a lot of people always ask me how come i don't record myself doing the head shake test and the answer is simple everything does not need to be memorialized if you see that image you can't unsee it uh you're going to lose a lot of respect for me if you see me shaking my head like that all right so now let's do the sound test now i got a classic song queued up we got michael jackson rock with you now i'm going to start off with max volume i got spatial audio turned on because i love that feature i got active noise cancellation turned on and of course i promise y'all i'm not going to sing here we go birdman hands rubbing together one tap for playing pause let's get into it okay here we go okay [Music] crystal clear crystal clear oh these sounds terrific [Music] girl close your eyes let that rhythm get into you let's go don't try to fight it there ain't nothing that you can do [Music] had to grab my mic let's go i don't know all right hold up all right here we go

song that i forgot all about okay love sosa all right here we go now let me just give you my initial impressions i think these sound better than the studio buds and better than the airpod pros now of course better than the powerbeats pro because these have anc and transparency mode these are just regular earbuds so these are already winning okay here we go let me calm down reel it in all right here we go love sosa this is the this is the new b the new uh bass test if y'all never heard this song trust me this is this song is maximum bass here we go all right hold up oh there we go here we go

son bro y'all bro boy let me calm down okay okay okay whoo let's do this what i'm talking about see let me take these out for a minute this is what i love about beach earbuds they're made for this kind of music okay now look if you're about to play beethoven's greatest hits go with the airpod pros right now if you're getting ready if you're getting ready to throw in some trap music some dubstep some hardcore hip-hop some techno dance something with a lot of bass you're going to like these you're going to like these these sound great let me do some more testing all right so now let's do the reconnection test how long do this take to reconnect to your phone after you take them out and put them in the charging case so you see it's connected let's hit play on the music okay there it is pop them out automatic pause i like that drop them in the case close them up disconnect it here we go one mississippi two mississippi three mississippi three mississippis that's excellent all right so now let's do the one earbud test can you play music from one earbud while the other one is charging up in the case all right here we go i got the music playing let's take out the left earbud drop it in the case hit play on the music okay the right side is playing let's put the left earbud back in wait for it to reconnect okay there it is now put the right side in the music automatically pauses let's hit play there it is the music is playing so this is pretty dope you can play music from either earbud while the other one is charging up in the case basically doubling your battery life alright so now let's check the touch controls and on the side note you can customize these through the app but the way i got mine set up is one tap for playing pause okay there it is that'll also answer and phone calls double tap to skip to the next song okay there it is triple tap to go back okay and long press the cycle between anc and transparency mode i'm gonna hold it down you hear a little bloom okay now now i'm clearly in transparency mode i hear everything and of course for voice assistant hey siri what's the weather for today there it is all of the touch controls work all right so now let's check the call quality now am i in school so i'm going to call up motorceps let's get max volume yeah hi uh can i speak to fred or leo yeah this flossy all right whoever that was that answered the phone they don't know me all right so they got some new cat there you do not know me all right they got me a hold now i will say this this is mad loud oh okay who's this fatty oh how you doing fatty let me ask you a question all right um how does my voice sound i'm using some earbuds i'm trying to see if the if my voice sounds good or not can you understand everything i'm saying it sounds clear oh okay okay okay okay that's all i wanted to know all right so all right so tell them i'll go back later all right no problem all right all right now [Laughter] that guy speaks russian so you know it's a little we we i heard him perfectly fine he heard me perfectly fine but he was more he was like uh going back later you know you make a bigger phone go back later now i heard it with no problems if you ever use any apple earbuds you already know they're known for the call quality and these are just the same right call quality sounds pretty good i'll do a little bit more testing off camera and i want to test these out versus my favorite earpods uh earpods my favorite earbuds for phone calls earpod pros all right so i'm gonna call up one of my boys i'm not gonna do this on camera but i'm gonna do a quick test and see which ones sound better all right so i just called my brother on the phone had a little conversation of course i broke out the brookstone fan so i could do the wind test and my brother said believe it or not i sounded better using the airpod pros now he said the uh beats fit pros were pretty good but the airpod pros just sounded a little bit more crystal clear and when i did the wind test he heard less wind so these are still the reigning champs for phone call quality all right so i just came back from doing a little workout so now we can talk about the rest of the features now as far as the range test i walked all the way to 50 feet no drop connection at all as far as latency i watched some youtube videos netflix and amazon prom no lag when you're watching your videos now active noise cancellation and transparency mode the transparency mode on these are some of the best that i've heard yet you can hear your voice crystal clear with your earbuds in now it doesn't have too much of that robotic kind of sound to it a little bit as all transparency earbuds do but not that much these are perfect for leaving in your ears and talking to your co-workers talking to the uh guy at the deli talking to people in the gym without taking the ear buds off now active noise cancellation y'all know i got three tiers we got trash tear okay tear and top tier okay and of course the mythical god tier that belongs to the sony and the bows these are not god tear i would place these at top tier noise cancellation right on par with the airpod pros right on par with the sennheisers and the pi7s and the eqs these are top tier noise cancellation perfect for the gym now speaking of the gym the biggest test that i wanted to do is see if i could really work out with these on and these not move around in my ears at all even when i start sweating extra hard i threw a little bit of water on my head too just to uh simulate the extra sweat now i don't sweat that much as flashing water on my face like that in my ears but these do not move so to make it a simple all right to make it simple let me answer those three questions number one audi's worth 200 bucks and the answer is yes worth every penny the sound quality is terrific active noise cancellation top tier more battery life than the earpod pros they look great they fit great did i say fit great they fit perfectly like the beats fit pro these should be called the beats fit perfect all right you're gonna like that wing next question how do i rank these versus my favorite apple earbuds these are now number one okay these are my number one apple earbuds number two i'm going with the airpod pros and number three the studio buds okay and the last question can these replace my powerbeats pro and the answer is yes now look there is still going to be a market for the powerbeats pro some people don't care about anc which i don't understand why a lot of people think active noise cancellation is some kind of gimmick don't knock it till you try it okay if you've been using these for the last two years and you think these sound great when you try these you're gonna notice that they sound a little bit better than the powerbeats but it's gonna feel like they sound a lot more better a lot more better a lot better better or more better whatever way you want to say it you're going to notice that the fit pros they're going to sound a lot better a lot more better i think i said it right a lot more better because of active noise cancellation okay i always tell people whenever they say active noise cancellation is a gimmick think about it like this whatever earbuds that you got without anc if you think they sound good imagine how better they're gonna sound now that word is trolling me imagine how much more better they're gonna sound when all of your background noise is blocked out now you can just focus on the music that's the main downfall for the powerbeats pro no anc now hopefully they come out with a set of wings like this powerbeats pro number twos with a and c because like i said there is a market for the wings people that do gymnastics people that do extreme sports right now i just did a regular workout but extreme sports you may want the hooks the hooks never move i don't care how many backflips i do some of y'all be thinking i'm camping when i say i do 36 backflips okay maybe i'm exaggerating a little maybe not 36 34. all right when i do my 34 black fix these never move at all my full workout with the power uh i keep saying beats my full workout with the beats fit pro these did not move at all these are the truth okay on a scale of 110 i'm giving these a major major major go these are now the best earbuds you could get from apple and at 200 bucks as bob barker would say the price is right anyway beats fit pro hit me up in the comments let me know what y'all think about these shout outs everybody rocking with me on facebook foursquare

38,TgWU51Lmxt4,Beats Fit Pro Buds Review | True Wireless Earbuds for Gym Fans,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgWU51Lmxt4,Tech Spurt, hello gorgeous peeps i'm chris from texpert and today we're going to be reviewing the beats fit pro some fresh new premium true wireless earbuds which will cost 199 pounds when they go on sale here in the uk from january the 28th so right up there in terms of the pricing with the most premium true analysis budgeting grab in 2022 considerably more expensive than the beats studio buds and almost as expensive as those powerbeats pro now i've been tested at the beats fit pro for over a week now so here's my in-depth review and for more on the latest a great stack please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell cheers so first up you can grab the beats fit pro and a choice of four different colors you've got your bog standard black and white otherwise also sage green and this very fetching supremely match your pinky purpley effort inside of the beats fit pro box you've got three different sizes of the fleshy ear tips you can find a size that fits your own particular logo size and shape and beats has included a fun little test as well just to make sure you are using the right size of ear bud as well make sure you've got a really sound fit i mean obviously you can sort of go by feel to make sure you've got the right size of tip but it's good to have extra confirmation that indeed yes you are using the right size for you the method insertion nice and easy just stick them in there and then rotate basically and they will fit in there nice and firmly and because the beats fit pro are designed with uh active users in mind so people who are gonna be you know jogging or hitting the gym things like that you do get this flexible wingtip which just helps to lodge the true wireless earbuds they're firmly into your ears make sure they don't go flying out of your head when you're you know you're jogging down the street and i thought this certainly did the job the beats fit pro are incredibly stable some of the best out there for active users and just to prove how good that fit is wash test unfortunately however although the fit is really really stable i do find that these flexible little hug things they're not quite the right size and shape for my ear holes they're not quite flexible enough as well to make them super comfortable to wear i find there is constant pressure against this little fleshy bit of my ear whatever on earth that is called and you know it's absolutely fine for about an hour maybe stretching to two hours then after that i do start to get the old ear fatigue things start to ache a bit i do have to take them out even if it's just for five minutes or so to give myself a break and yeah it may well be that i have weirdly shaped ears and no other reviewers have had this exact problem because beats are very very confident that it is a perfect design uh but yes certainly for me it just did not really work for the long term use and now frankly i'm starting to get a little bit of an ear complex as far as the bluetooth connectivity goes no real worries there whatsoever i had a couple of occasions in the past sort of 10 days or so where they connected to my phone but then they refused to play the actual uh audio and i just for full disclosure as well i have been using them full time with android smartphones because that's what i've been testing out rather than iphones but you know 19 times out of 20 they'll connect absolutely fine pair up no worries and then the actual connection stays strong and stable as well even when i'm in a really busy area absolutely churning with fellow human beings all using their own wireless gizmos and of course because these are premium true wireless earbuds they pack in all of the features you would hope for and expect so for instance you've got auto paws whenever you yank out one of the buds then auto play it as well so whatever you're listening to will stop when you yank out the bird and then resume again when you shove it back in your head that's a feature we didn't get on the beats studio buds which were still pretty pricey so it's good to see them actually included here on the beats fit pro and while most true wireless earbuds feature touch sensitive controls so you just lightly tap one area of the external bit of it in order to pause play skip etc etc here on the beats fit pro it's actually a physical push button which you just lightly pork in order to access those controls the push section pretty much takes up the entire external surface of the beats fit pro so very easy to find and very intuitive and they're very straightforward controls as well basically a single tap will pause your music and then another tap will resume you've got a double tap in order to skip forwards a track and a triple tap in order to skip back unfortunately in the beats app for android you can't configure those controls so it's a real shame i would have preferred for instance double tapping the left buds in order to skip back a track double tap the right button or to skip forward a track and then maybe the triple taps could be volume control or something but yeah you can't do that inside of the beats app what you do have control over is the long press which can either toggle between your enc mode and transparency mode or just knock the whole lot off or also conjure up your smartphone assistant so personally i was using the left bud to cycle the anc on and off between that and transparency and the right buds in order to call up my smartphone assistant and speaking of smartphone assistants you do have full hey siri hands-free support if you've got an iphone so you don't have to do any poke no problem whatsoever to call her up but as i say i was testing on android so i didn't get a chance to check that out yeah overall the touch controls do get a thumbs up from me the only slight problem is that because it's an actual push button you are sort of driving the buds into your ears every time you use those touch controls so if you do use them quite a bit then yeah you do get that little bit of ear fatigue a little bit sooner than you would have done as for the audio quality well pretty solid here on the beats fit pro as you kind of hope for a 200 pound pair of true wireless earbuds especially considering they're only using the sbc and the aac codex as usual no support for aptx adaptive or anything like that though thankfully touch words i haven't experienced any syncing issues whatsoever when i've been watching a bit of disney plus netflix youtube i found that unlike the beats of yesteryear you want to have a pretty decent balance between the bass and the treble the bass is slightly emphasized as usual but really not to a horrific degree whatsoever it doesn't matter what genre of music you're into if it's classical jazz hip-hop rock metal you don't necessarily get all of the finer details coming through on some of those more complex tracks especially if you listen to a bit of jazz and blues or a bit of metal uh but really really solid all the same and i did find the vocals in particular come through really crisp and clear and well defined so if you do listen to a lot of audio audiobooks or podcasts then job done and if you're on an iphone 7 or later you can enjoy a tasty bit of special audio action here on the beats fit pro as well so in supported content and the likes of apple tv plus for instance you'll find that the audio is directional shifting as you move your head and of course like every other pair of premium true disables of this sort of price point you've got active noise cancellation built into the beats fit pro as well and this is pretty bloody good it's not quite up to the standard set by the likes of sony for instance on their true wireless earbuds but very very solid competition indeed so if you're wandering down a high street for instance lots of traffic go and buy lots of people wandering by dogs cats whatever you'll find that most of that surrounding sound is blocked out quite comfortably so you can listen to the likes of podcasts and audiobooks again without them to jack the volume all the way up which is definitely very much appreciated but yeah as with all wireless earbuds really the quality of that anc does depends on how good a fit you've got with your locals make sure you've got the right size of tip shoved in there you've also got a transparency mode as well which as i said before you can flick to with a long press of the buds and this will just make you aware of everything that's going on around you basically pipes in all of that sound via the microphones the twin beam former microphones which are built into the external bit of the beats fit pro and speaking of these mics these are used whenever you're making a phone call or whatever via the beats fit pro and they're designed to lock onto your voice while also dampening out any background noise that's going on all around you and does it work not really but here i am walking down the street got some uh some traffic going by on the left hand side and uh just tested microphones just to see how clearly they're picking up my voice and how good the jobs they're doing of drowning out all of that lovely traffic in lots of stairs because i'm just just walking down the street talking to myself with bright pink birthday things sticking out my ears but i don't care i've got no dignity left so as you can hear there when i was making calls with people they could hear what i was seeing but it certainly didn't do anything to drown out any of the noise that was going on around me either so i'd say try not to make calls you know on your local high street or in the middle of a rave or anything like that so battery life and beats reckon you'll get a full six hours of play time from the fit pro if they are fully charged and that is with the active noise cancellation that turned on otherwise you can expect an extra hour or two and i found my testing that's pretty much bang on in fact they sometimes got a little bit more than those six hours usually around sort of six and a half hours and when they are fully drained or you just want to stash them away again you've got of course the lovely rot the fetch and beats fit pro case which matches the color of your buds and yeah it's not exactly the dinkiest charging case around it's a bit of a monster to be perfectly honest with you but at least it's got that lovely rounded pebble style shape and that helps it to slip inside of a pocket or a bag or whatever as with most premium true wireless earbuds you've got fast charging support so bang them in that case around five to ten minutes you'll get around an hour of use from fully drained buds and that is with anc on even though the case itself is a bit of a whopper you'll get around three full recharges of your buds from it before the case itself is fully drained as well you can charge it back up again using a type c usb cable you get a fantastically tiny one bundled in the box but you know you can provide your own no wireless charging support unfortunately here on the beats fit pro which is a massive shame because most premium rivals and even some drywallers earbuds roughly half the price of this thing do offer wireless charging now so that's a bit of a bum so right there's my full final beats fit pro review and i gotta say i enjoyed using them but for 199 quid i'd say maybe just chuck a bit extra in and upgrade to those powerbeats pro which are absolutely sublime other likes the sony ws which are both better anc and a better all-around feature set of course the big draw of the beats fit pro is going to be for more active users because you've got that flexible wing tip as well although i did find that impacted the comfort level so if you want buds that you're going to be rocking in your ears for good so you know three four hours even longer than that then you might want to look elsewhere sadashi blows but be great to hear from you guys down below if you've actually been using the beats fit pro for instance if you're in the us or you're watching this video after the uk launch would be great to hear your thoughts in those comments please do poke subscribe and dig that notifications bell for more on the latest and greatest technology salsa fan bloody tastic rest of the week cheers everyone love you [Music] [Music] foreign,Beats Fit Pro Earbuds,The beats fit pro true wireless earbuds will cost 199 pounds when they go on sale in the UK from January 28th.They come in four different colors and three different sizes of the fleshy ear tips.The fit is really stable but they are not quite the right size and shape for my ear holes they're not quite flexible enough to make them super comfortable to wear.The beats fit pro are designed with uh active users in mind so people who are gonna be you know jogging or hitting the gym. beats fit pro have touch sensitive controls so you just lightly tap one area of the external bit of it in order to pause play skip etc etc.The push section pretty much takes up the entire external surface of the beats fit pro.Unlike the beats of yesteryear you want to have a pretty decent balance between the bass and the treble. The beats fit pro has a full six hours of play time if fully charged and active noise cancellation turned on otherwise you can expect an extra hour or two.The case is a bit of a monster to be perfectly honest with you but at least it's got that lovely rounded pebble style shape.The big draw of the beats fit pro is going to be for more active users because you've got that flexible wing tip.
39,XpKir0z0udY,Do You Remember BEATS??? - Fit Pro,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpKir0z0udY,ShortCircuit," - Everyone's talking about Apple stuff these days, but what about their ugly cousin Beats? This is the actual retail packaging. Just joking, it's gonna be good. We've got three different colors. Oh, this one's gonna be the stone purple. I've seen stones like that. This one is a sage gray. Sage gray makes it seem like this is a green type of gray, but I would argue that this is a gray type of green. What the hell is this, another green one? - [Jono] Oh, really? - I can't abide. This dude cannot abide. Oh, wait a second. Oh, they just didn't wanna give me a boring black box. Here's the real retail packaging. There they are. Well, first of all, purple's my favorite color. I own it now. And I'm starting to dig getting tech products and other things that are just not black anymore. I used to do black for everything. All black all the time but now it's just kind of boring. And as Jono from Horace said minutes ago, I think aluminum is our generation's beige. - [David] Yup! - And it's like, yeah. Now these side by side, if I was on the store shelf, it almost just looks like a difference in printing quality of the ink, very subtle though. We'll open them up and check it out. What does this little paper say? It's pretty damn satisfying when you find the perfect fit. Whether your jeans or your person, the search can be exhausting. The search for your perfect fitting person. Is that what that saying? - [David] Yeah. - Okay. - [David] Search for love. - Let's check it out. Oh, that is so glued. Look at that. Oh, look at it straight across the whole thing. That can't be right. No, no, no, it's not right. Look at these little arrows. They're screaming at you. Don't be dumb. It's just that easy. All right, which one's which guys shell game? Place your bets, David. Purple where? - [David] Uuh, middle. Dang it! - Jono, purple where? - [Jono] To your right. (soft screaming) - [David] That's not fair! - Beat by Jono. Okay, this gray and black are obviously different. First impression from here, they kind of don't look expensive. They're $200 but, I don't know, something about the look of this plastic especially the gray one. It doesn't look great. I wouldn't get the gray one. The inside is cool it's got that more green on the inside. Playful. Boring black with the red. Yeah, gray? No. It's in like, it's the worst of all worlds. It's not like subtle like the black and it's not outrageous like the purple. So yeah, I would pass on that personally. This lid kind of rattly. Look at you can see it bounce on the open. It's like bodongdong. Like, it goes back and forth a bit. Not a small case, but I think it's smaller than the Powerbeats Pro case. It has USBC charging and it looks like it's the type where you pair it by hitting the button on the inside of the case, which I prefer. It's a lot easier than holding out a button on the ear bud and not knowing what's going on. And if you have an iPhone, it's supposed to have that magic pairing process which you can get in Android if you configure it in the app. And I do have the companion app. We'll check that out in a bit. But let's do the unboxing. Inside is just a little USBC. The C cable. The very little. It's a wee C to C. Great sound starts with proper fit. Different ear tips. I guess the medium ones are on there. They've got small and large. And then there's some literature. I guess they're advertising for Apple Music. Got your structions. You got a sticker. Cool. Wait a second. What box did that stuff come out of, the gray one? Do you get different ear tips for the different colors? Yes! Purple ear tips in the purple box. These were for the gray box and stands to reason black. You think if you mix and match that's cooler if I put a black one on there? - [David] I mean they are in your ear. - Yeah, they should be completely occluded by your ear but I don't know. Well we won't see I'm not gonna bother trying it. You're not gonna buy two or like share or something. It's unlikely. Let's see how they click back into the case. Oops. Not bad. Not bad. Will I ever get confused? Probably not. It's pretty obvious that because they have this big wing tip that that's gonna go up into the area where there's space for it so I think it'd be pretty clear which one goes where. The earbud itself it is a pretty clean look. They've got this flexible wing tip here which they're saying that they surveyed all these different ears and it's supposed to fit with everybody. There's a button on here. It has a nice feeling. It's tactile, but it's not clicky. You can hear it when it's in your ear. (ear pods clicking) Can you hear that? - [David] Yup. - Cool. But it's imperceptible from even here. You could sit by someone on an airplane and not even hear that. It's got the detectors for skin so it should pause when you take it out. I think the bill quality of the earbud is better than the case. All right, I'm gonna pair these to my app now, right after this message from our sponsor, Honey.

Need location access. Only this one time. Beats Fit Pro detected. I guess I kinda click that. Oh, what is going on? - [Jono] Is it because you have all three open? - Oh my God. (all laughing) Now I've got to hold the button down. - [Jono] Is the light blinking? - Yeah, there's a light on the front of this blinking now. Can you see this? Here we go. There we go. Now it's telling me how to do it. For our comfortable and secure fit, rotate the wing tip into the upper part of your ear. But I already knew that because I've worn headphones. How does it look? - [Jono] It looks actually pretty good. - Oh, there's like some kind of transparency mode on right now. You got kind of amplify it. - [Jono] Nice. - Twist the bud. Okay I got that. Whoa, cool. It's like it knows that they're purple and it's given me like a purple UI. That's pretty. That's a nice touch. - [Jono] It does protrude out of your ears though. - These protrude a bit? - [Jono] Yeah. - They look a little dumb straight on? - [Jono] Yeah. - [David] I wouldn't say it looks dumb, but it looks like they could fall out at any second. - They look insecure? - [David] Yeah. - Well, we're gonna test that in a bit because they say that these are gonna be secure enough because of this wing tip for the most vigorous workouts, burpees, other stuff. ANC off. Can you speak to me again? - [Jono] Intimate encounters. - Intimate encounters. Transparency. Oh, now transparency is on. Before it was just ANC. That sounds kind of wacky. - [Jono] I saw Dune again last night. - I've seen Dune twice also. - [Jono] Yeah, it's great. - Nice work And now noise canceling is on. Okay, cool. I'm gonna just turn it off. You can rename your Beats. That's good. Beats Fit Pro. Beats Fit, bro. How about that? Oh, a generated a name? Mars. Poupon. I'm keeping these as Poupon. This is a pretty nice app. Product features, automatic ear detection is on so it'll pause. Adjust the controls as you prefer. So right now press and hold is doing what? Press and hold on both left and right Beats to adjust volume up and down. What the heck? I've never seen that interaction on earphones before. Press and hold on both to adjust volume up and down. What does that mean? You press and hold them both and then what? This isn't gonna tell me anything. Okay, I think what this means is press and hold on either the left or right. Like I think it means on the left, you hold that and it goes volume down. Yeah, look at it. There's my phone adjusting. On the right, you hold that and it's volume up. It actually does not mean press and hold on both. That's, oh look at the volume! (presenter giggling) That's amazing. That, okay it's a gesture I've never seen before and it still doesn't exist. Microphone. The active Beats Fits Pro microphone can automatically change from left to right. That's sick. So it's saying that the mic, the mic is using during a call could either be on this bud or on this bud, because there's lots of mics on each bud because the mics are used for active noise canceling. But I suppose it's saying that there is a preferred microphone to use in any given situation depending on the noise around you so it'll actually switch during our call which mic it's using. I don't know how it's determining which earphone mic it should use but I would leave it on automatic. Try it at least. Noise canceling with one ear bud. Allow earbuds to be put in noise cancellation mode when only one is in your ear. That is an interesting option. I'm not inclined to put that on, but it's interesting that they give you the choice. I think that's cool. I'm gonna just play some music. Dune soundtracks, subscribe to They're Just Movies. That was like a two hour podcast. Okay, so I'm not even gonna assess the sound right now I just wanna know one press for pause, double tap for next, triple tap restarts, and long press is gonna giving me volume. Now I'm gonna go back to the app and see if I turn off the volume control if I get transparency mode through that. Oh, Poupon, welcome back. Bienvenido. Okay, press and hold. Let's try turning off volume control. Now what happens when I hold? I heard badang and now I'm in transparency mode. Now, if I go again, now I'm in nothing mode. Now I'm in. I'm trying to figure out if holding one or the other matters. What is this? What is this? Hello? I don't feel like I'm transitioning or cycling between three different modes. I feel like I'm going between like ANC on and transparency. Also, I don't know about the comfort of these man. Not loving it. I feel like it's kind of hurting my upper ear, the conch part where that thing fits in. Actually I wanna see if they really do fit in really well. They're pretty secure. Can I do burpees though? They're in there. They're IPX4 rated which they thought was cool enough to put on their marketing but honestly that's like pretty bog standard, especially for $200. Let's play some songs that I'm familiar with. Bass is pretty low. Oh I love this snare sound in this song is such a good snare sound. Yeah, they have their beats signature tuning, which is pretty much V-shaped. I think that they also say in their marketing that it's like a, it's a balanced listening experience but I think that the bass is a bit overcooked but most people are gonna like that honestly. The metal test. If there's ever like double kicks and all you hear is like, (presenter blubbering) because the bass isn't fast enough to differentiate the two strikes. The test I like to do with metal though is I turn it up loud and I see how harsh the guitar sound. These are plenty loud enough I don't wanna go higher than this even. It doesn't sound great loud not because of the harshness, but just because of like, it's just really, everything's kind of blurred together I'm getting less differentiation between the instruments. Now, if I'm onto hip hop then these are way better suited for that. ""California Love"" sounds great. Yeah, I think that the performance of them is commensurate with other products in this category. $200 is pretty much the sound you get. I think everybody knows this point what the signature Beat sound is and that's what you're getting here. No surprises. Now let's talk about the competitive landscape. These are 200 bucks. The Powerbeats Pro which this product is supposed to be positioned between the Powerbeats Pro which is $250 MSRP and the, where are they? I got the little ones here. The earlier studio beats. These guys Beats Studio Buds, which were 150. Slightly smaller case. These are obviously not as targeted toward fitness people. Although I will say that this doesn't feel like it's as in my ear either. Does that look like it chats out of my ear? - [David] No. - [Jono] No. That actually looks good. - You like that one more? - [Jono] Yeah. - You can get Powerbeats Pro for 200 bucks right now. People like those earphones a lot. So they're the same price as these new ones so I don't know how to what extent these are gonna to like be, you know, filling out there. They align with like options at every price point. Now I haven't used the Powerbeats Pro myself. I know that Riley and Lance would really be like them. So I don't know if the extra 50 bucks gets you better sound quality or better battery life or what. Or if it's just like time has passed and you might as well just buy these because they're like new and improved. - [Jono] What about the AirPods Pro? - The AirPods Pro are 250 bucks also, right? Yeah. - [David] It's in a chip. - Yeah, this also does have the H1 chip in it that gives you all like the Apple Magic. $30 more than the new AirPods Gen three which don't have ANC. Oh, these also have spatial audio because they have that H1 chip. Spacial audio I think is dumb. First thing I would never use it. If you don't know what it is, it basically instead of surround sound, it makes it so like your source device is a fixed location. So like when we watch TV and we don't have earphones in, when we turn our heads, that sound of the TV is over there and then when I turn my head this way I can hear it differently. That's what it does. I don't really know why you want that. I've tried it it's like okay. It's not on all content and I think it might be iOS only. It's definitely iOS only. So not a selling feature for me. Would I get these above AirPods for $30 cheaper? If I want ANC, yeah. Would I get them instead of AirPods Pro and save 50 bucks? I don't know. You'd have to wait for a review for that personally, but I probably would lean towards spending the 50 bucks. Battery life on these things. If you have ANC or transparency mode on you get six hours per listen and then an additional 21 out of the charge case. So three more charges for a total of 27. If you don't have ANC on you get seven hours plus an additional like 30. So you got 37 in total. And in five minutes of USBC fast charging you get an hour of playback. One thing I will say is that other earphones in this price here do give you more options in terms of EQs. Some of them have apps where you can just adjust the frequency response as you want. And I prefer that over an earphone that has a signature sound that tells you what you want. I mean, I think you can get apps for that but I'd like to have it out of the box. Yeah. Look at that. Isn't that cute? I think it actually would look better like this though maybe. Whatever. Thanks for watching short circuit guys.

40,f3DfJxvkN-8,AirPods Pro 2 Review: 1 Underrated Thing!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3DfJxvkN-8,Marques Brownlee, [Music] all right I'll be honest I wasn't even planning on reviewing these you know it's Tech Timber there's there's a lot of stuff going on right now like there's other videos on other Tech that we're actively working on that's coming soon that you'll see so you know we saw the new airpods announcement in the keynote and the couple new features and then Apple sent over a pair it's got my memoji on it and everything I was like that's cute but I promise you I didn't even take it out the box for a few days because I was so busy working on some of the other stuff but then I did take it out the box and I did try them and I gotta say I I am now very convinced that these are really good but not by what you think so there's a lot of small new features here that airpods people have been waiting for for a long time on the surface it's still in a nearly identical design you recognize them from a mile away the only way you can tell them apart from the last airpods Pro visually is by these dual vents at the top but on the inside there is an entirely new driver and amplifier and these airpods do sound dramatically better than the last ones easily the best sounding earbuds Apple's ever made there are way more lows and mids so if you listen to Hip Hop or just music with a lot of bass it's very noticeable it's just way better and there's also very little high volume Distortion and just the whole sound profile is very responsive and crisp they sound good like really good earpods now there still is no lossless audio with these but it's still 16 bit 48 kilohertz audio and that is good but that wasn't the thing that convinced me it was a Difference Maker for sure it's really nice but that's not the thing these do now have a 33 longer battery life so it's six hours on a single charge now with noise cancellation on and up to 30 total hours with the battery in the case I promise you I'll never have earbuds in for six hours straight so this was more than enough for me but it wasn't what impressed me either there is also a new extra small ear tip so now it comes with the mediums installed by default and then there's two sizes smaller and one larger size so if you had smaller ears that the previous airpods didn't quite work with these may make a difference for you with the extra small ear tip as you can imagine that's not me mediums all the way but some maybe even tempted to say that the new case is the biggest upgrade that's certainly what I thought when I watched the keynote it's like apple had a meeting about how wow people are losing these things and getting them mixed up with other people's airpods and then they just decided to do something about it so the case is the same size and shape but there's this lanyard loop on the side now in case you want to attach it to something it's kind of like the loop on the top of the water bottle at mkbhd.com but just way smaller and then you can use whatever language you want to attach it to but if that's not good enough for you there's a whole speaker at the bottom of the case now and it is surprisingly useful so it can play a loud sound to help you find them on top of the Precision finding that already works really well since it has a U1 chip inside so it's just like an air tag if it's somewhere in your general vicinity it can guide you to it that is sweet it also plays a sound when you get it on a charger wired or Wireless and the magsafe ring helps it stay in place on any magsafe wireless charging puck that's not new but it also now works with Apple watch Chargers too which is a nice touch on top of all that it is still ipx4 water resistant which is an extra layer of security if you work out and sweat around the case or if you end up in the rain in these and you can engrave it with your memoji now so your friends will never accidentally pick up your airpods case by mistake but not even that is what was convincing me about the airpods pro 2. not even the most requested feature apparently this is something lots of other earbuds have had but volume control on the earbud itself it's on the stock now so of course it is now much more convenient to just adjust the volume without having to reach for your phone it's kind of like this pinch gesture where you hold your finger on one side and then slide with the other on the flat spot on the stock it's kind of awkward at first but you do get used to it but no it was none of that the thing that convinced me with these headphones that they are incredible is the H2 chip so previous years generations of Apple headphones have had the H1 chip inside and it's this little chip that's doing the audio processing noise cancellation Etc this is the second generation of that chip and apple is bragging on stage that it has like a billion transistors or something ridiculous whatever the point of the chip is that it enables everything that is special about these new airpods so first of all there is much improved active noise cancellation Apple said something like up to two times more background noise is removed versus the last generation I don't know about all that but combining these new drivers and the sound profile with the improved noise cancellation is definitely noticeable I mean it's incredible with white noise like air conditioners and transportation you put the headphones on and it just erases them immediately like I'm not the type of person to wear earbuds for an entire flight I still much prefer over-the-ear headphones for that but I get it with these now I understand why people would want to wear these earbuds on a plane because they cancel is that well I'm putting them on the same level of like the Sony mark IV earbuds and right below the new Bose quiet Comfort earbud twos and I put them above the airpods Maxes as far as how well it actually cancels sound I mean they still sound very different I did the back to back test don't get me wrong you can tell the much bigger driver makes a difference in the airpods max but these get quieter they remove more background noise now there is already a lot of computational audio happening in airpods Pro Sound they're literally adjusting the EQ with everything you listen to and across every different volume level to make sure they sound a certain way which is kind of funny it actually makes them hard to review sometimes against other headphones because every track hits a little bit different but the one huge Advantage airpods have had for a long time now over the competition over the poses and the Samsungs and the pixel buds of the world is the transparency mode as someone who has used them all like the transparency mode from airpods has for a while been on a level by itself Above the Rest the real-time pass-through of outside sound is kind of amazing and in these with the H2 chip it is leveled up again so on stage Apple introduced what they're calling adaptive transparency mode it's actually not a separate mode it's still the transparency mode which is with a different name but what's happening is it's still passing through all the outside sound but anytime there's a loud or a harsh sound above 85 decibels it cuts that sound down to not be loud and harsh so let's say you're walking or biking through the city you need to keep transparency mode on so you can hear the cars and the people around you for safety but you're still listening to music or a podcast or whatever and then an ambulance drives past you Sirens blaring you will still hear the sirens but that super loud sound will be suppressed to a level that doesn't hurt your ears it's just it's super smart like and that ambulance could be anything that could be uh someone honking it could be a jackhammer construction noise it could be a dog barking but it's keeping it's keeping the same sound signature of whatever sound that is and just bringing it down below a certain level and it's doing it all in real time with virtually no DeLay So the crazy number is it's sampling outside sound 48 000 times per second apparently that's 240 times faster than the last generation and so it could even be like a really sharp like quick outside sound like a dog barking it will actually reduce a loud dog barking as fast as it's actually happening so by the time it reaches your ears it's a lower degree of sound it's crazy now I've been trying it I've been walking around with them and it's working really well it's so good that this is this is a real situation a scenario that I've dreamed up that I believe could happen I haven't tried this myself but you know how you typically go to a super loud concert and like front row middle row like the speakers are obviously too loud they're damaging your ears if you have an Apple Watch it's giving you like you know warnings that you if you're in this type of sound for too long it'll be damaging to your hearing instead of wearing earplugs you can actually you can really do this you can wear airpods Pro 2 and put them in transparency mode and it will take the entire sound signature of that whole thing you're listening to and it will drop it down to a reasonable level you'll still feel the bass in your chest of the speakers but your hearing won't be damaged as much because it's taking all of that and reducing it and you're still hearing the music that's incredible so all this real-time processing is happening on the earbuds not on your phone and that is the H2 chip at work plus there's also a few other features it enables too it talks to the noise app on the Apple watch in real time to show you how much noise is being canceled out in case you want a visual for that sort of thing and also if you accidentally ever put the wrong earbud in your case like someone else's the speaker will actually play a chime and you'll get a mismatched airpods notification on your phone another nice touch for those people who have inevitably lost airpods to their friends cases and probably don't even know it and then there's a new ear scan for personalized spatial audio this was kind of a weird one so it's using the face ID depth sensors to measure your head and measure the depth of your ears to give you a personalized spatial audio mix Sony's been doing the same thing for a little bit with some of their headphones they use the front-facing camera I don't know if I was uh convinced that the usefulness of this I mean the spatial audio was already pretty good but after I did the personalized audio basically for me it just sounded like the Sound Stage got a little bit wider maybe like there's just a bit more of a spread to how far apart the different sounds and instrumentals are I don't know exactly how much of the ear scan data was being used for this but that's even more computational audio thanks to the H2 chip overall though these airpods are a significant upgrade and they're just flat out better than I expected I wasn't expecting this much of a change and they sound way better they work way better there is still lots of other competition in the in the earbuds World Samsung's buds are really good I also really like the pixel buds I did a whole separate video review of those if you want to watch it you can check it out with the card but at the beginning of the video I said a little phrase I don't know if you caught it but I said airpods people airpods people and this is something that you might see a lot if you live in a major city or where there's a lot of mass transit or something like that it's it's when people just wear air pods everywhere they go like they walk around the streets with them they bike around they just live with airpods in their ears and these are going to be amazing for those people like it's everything you'd care about it's the better battery life it's the better sound quality it's the better noise cancellation and much better transparency mode the better case the volume control on the stocks all in one package at the same price I get it I get it it's really good airpods Pro 2 really really good and now you know why all right that's it thanks for watching catch in the next one peace [Applause] [Music] [Applause],AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds,There's a lot of small new features here that airpods people have been waiting for for a long time on the surface.The case is the same size and shape but there's this lanyard loop on the side now in case you want to attach it to something.The magsafe ring helps it stay in place on any magsafe wireless charging. Volume control on the earbud itself is on the stock now.Apple said something like up to two times more background noise is removed versus the last generation.The real-time pass-through of outside sound is kind of amazing. You can wear airpods Pro 2 and put them in transparency mode.It will take the entire sound signature of that whole thing you're listening to and it will drop it down to a reasonable level.There's a new ear scan for personalized spatial audio.
41,oHOwfAcNG2c,AirPods Pro 2: Why is everybody praising these,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHOwfAcNG2c,The Verge, three years later and we finally have the second generation of Apple's airpods Pro they're 249 dollars they have a better case proved battery life and an all-new H2 chip that Apple claims delivers Advanced computational Audio previously unable to run on a device of this size and that coupled with new vent placements reportedly adds up to twice the amount of active noise cancellation over the previous airpods Pro thing about reviewing earbuds on video is that features such as ANC are incredibly hard to demonstrate so I wanted to try something new this is Owen he set up a sort of blind active noise cancellation test that's going to simulate common noises that most folks who are wearing ANC buds want to cancel out every earbud fits every ear differently and that is incredibly important to ANC performance but I'm hoping that this test will give us a general idea of how each of these earbuds perform I'm going to be listening to the same song on four pairs of wireless earbuds that we hear the Verge think have the best active noise cancellation in this price range if slash when I hear a noise I'll raise this sign and then we'll move on to the next sound okay oh yeah is that like white noise is that like a deep I can like feel it but I can't hear it all set yeah wow okay so jackhammers yep okay no other parrot earbuds came close to canceling as much noise as the Bose quiet Comfort twos did it was almost scary how much I couldn't hear that being said the airpod Pro's second gen did cancel out a pretty good amount of noise and definitely more than the previous version now they also have a feature called active transparency mode which is when you're in transparency mode meaning that you can hear the things around you if there's annoying sounds supposed to take those sounds down so you have a more pleasant listening experience now I have had an incredibly hard time getting this to children in fact I haven't been able to get it to trigger even here in the studio we played some Jackhammer sounds and I couldn't get it to take them down so we'll have to use these headphones more and see if we can get that feature to work at all for folks coming from the original airpods Pro the biggest changes you'll notice are actually in the case there's a lanyard loop on the side and now the case can be charged via magsafe or on any Apple watch charger but more importantly the case now makes sound the only visual difference to the buds themselves is the vent is now located on the top of the bud and there's an added extra small size ear tip option on the stem there's also now the ability to swipe up and down to adjust the earbuds volume I have thought that all earbuds should have swiping volume control so it's absolutely excellent to see that coming to these earbuds Apple also claims that they've improved the inward facing mics on these buds so we put them through the ultimate stress test okay I wanted to do this mic test for a very long time these are the 249 second gen air pod pros and we're on a boat the boat test is not just about wind it's also about background noise it's also about just wanting to talk on the phone when you want to talk on the phone and these are the original airpods Pro you can get them for like 179 dollars oh man nice windshield technology on their earbuds but this is a lot of wind and a lot of back runways okay okay but here's what they sound like in a more controlled environment there's like a noisy fridge behind me but otherwise we're in a quiet office I continue to be impressed with the mic on the Sony link buds I continue to be disappointed by the mic on the Samsung buds 2 Pro but to me the first gen airpods Pro don't really sound all that different from the second generation of the airpods pro and well nothing will ever come close to the wired Apple headphones that of course have incredible mic placement and a solid wired connection but how did the airpod pros sound [Music] the new airpods Pro have a personalized spatial audio feature that is created via the true depth camera on the iPhone it always feels fun to go through a personalization setup but rarely does it affect real life performance and sadly that is true here as well I did not notice any real change in spatial audio performance post personalization but that didn't make me any less in love with head tracking which many folks with label as a gimmick and I don't know it just hasn't gotten old for me yet and I especially love making people use it who have never tested it before it's it's really cool it's a great bar trick but more importantly the second generation airpod Pros have an improved H2 chip and new amps and drivers the company claims that this creates deeper bass and crisper highs and yeah it does these buds sound great and Incredibly full with a balanced amount of bass but if you're coming from the previous airpod Pros I'm not sure there's like that much of a difference those earbuds had great sound and these do too I made a playlist that I'll link down below full of all the songs I've been listening to while testing these Buds and they happen to be all these like full really Punchy songs they have lots of highs and lows and and good bass and I mean these headphones they really shine when they can kind of separate all those sounds for you now something that previous owners of airpod pros and new owners will notice is battery life the new buds have six hours of battery life with ANC turned on in four and a half hours of continuous talk time from a single charge all that means that during a work day I started at 9 30 a.m I was able to get around 3 P.M before the buds died it's definitely better and will feel amazing if your first gen airpod Pros batteries have begun to fade so the second generation airpods Pro they're not the stemless earth-shattering earbuds I was kind of hoping they would be but there's solid upgrade to the previous version Apple took an already great product and added some simple upgrades to battery life some minor case improvements a bump in audio quality and a much bigger bump in ANC and added a few gimmicks like personalized spatial audio and all of these things will make these airpods Pro feel new and special to owners of the previous airpods Pro but I don't think there's enough there for folks who aren't due for an upgrade to jump at but I'm just not so sure why I'm seeing so many reviews like absolutely raving about these earbuds they're they're good yes but they're not nearly as groundbreaking as the first generation was and of course if you are an iOS user you're gonna love the tight integration with the ecosystem and you're probably absolutely going to buy these so long as they fit your ears but for everybody else there's a whole huge sea of wireless earbuds that have better ANC like the Bose qc2s or I don't know better audio quality like Sony's WF wf-1000xm4s I think that it's a bad it's a bad name but I think that's it or I don't know anything from anchor that's going to be a much cheaper price but if you love your airpod Pros or you're set on having a pair of airpod Pros then these These are the absolutely best ones yeah I couldn't get this sound to play when we were doing the case sound test because the headphones weren't dead but they're dying now so this is the sound that it makes when you put your headphones in the case and the headphones are dying it is the most useful sound I have because it reminds you to charge it anyway that's sweet right [Laughter],AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds,The second generation of Apple's airpods Pro have a better case proved battery life and an all-new H2 chip.Apple also claims that they've improved the inward facing mics on these buds.The biggest changes you'll notice are actually in the case there's a lanyard loop on the side.Now the case can be charged via

42,Xy8yJcVjQGk,AirPods Pro 2 Review: Two Months Later,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy8yJcVjQGk,CNET, [Music] after spending two months with the airpods Pro 2 I'm really surprised at how much I like these wireless earbuds from the improvements to sound quality over the originals to longer lasting battery life and an even better fit than before it all adds up to a great all-round experience now they're not perfect but I think for many people they're going to come pretty darn close in this video we're going to explore what they like to use every day and I'll share some tips and tricks that I found to get the most out of these wireless earbuds so whether you've also been using them for the same amount of time as me or you've been wanting to find out more about how they hold up long term well let's Dive In for my fellow small ear Brigade the airpods Pro 2 fit so much better than the first generation okay so the physical design hasn't really changed but the difference is there's now an extra small ear tip size which quite frankly has been a game changer for me in terms of getting these to fit really well finally they stay in my ears even when I'm working out without needing to reposition them constantly and push them in throughout the day so on the first generation airpods Pro I would always need to use third-party foam tips now don't get me wrong these are absolutely great and Incredibly functional so I could always get a really secure fit but it is an extra cost on top of the earbuds themselves and of course there is a little bit more effort required to sort of pinch and insert those memory foam tips rather than just popping them in with the default silicon tips and sometimes depending on the size and design of the tips they do need a little bit more adjusting to get them to sit in the charging case properly now I got my wish for extra small ear tips but I just hope that there is an option for Apple to add an extra large ear tip size as I know that there are many people on the other end of the ear canal Spectrum who also need a different fit from those included four sizes now if you're on the fence about upgrading from the original airpods Pro and you also have small ears well you don't necessarily have to spend big just to get that better fit because the good news is I found those extra small second generation tips actually fit on the first generation airpods Pro and they cost eight dollars from Apple directly for two sets many airpods users myself included have been asking for volume controls on the stem and Apple has delivered with the second generation but I do find the precise finger placement is key and for me it's taken a little bit more time to get used to this than I would have liked look maybe it's a fat fingers issue but even after two months I still don't get it right all the time and I accidentally end up going through the stem itself rather than where you should be swiping on which is the force sensor so I do actually find it a little bit easier to make kind of a rest for the bottom of the stem with my thumb and then swipe with my index finger up and down and this really helps so I'm not accidentally dislodging it from my ear as I'm trying to find that sweet spot again I'd expect everyone's experience with this is going to be slightly different depending on how they fit in the ear I'm really glad that the stem controls are now present but more often than not over the past few months I've definitely found myself still in the habit of adjusting the volume on my phone or if I'm wearing wearing an Apple Watch with the digital crown and also it's the little things that I really appreciate how these no longer have that kind of high-pitched squeal noise that you might have experienced on The Originals when you have noise canceling on and you accidentally cover the grill with your hand or in some cases it would happen with my longer hair or for those of you who like to sleep with earbuds on I know there are some of you out there it could sometimes happen when you rest your head against the pillow so my eardrums thank you for alleviating that on the newer version Apple thank you no earbud video is complete without talking about the sound and of course this is very subjective but for me the airpods Pro 2 have really filled in the picture compared to the first generation now if you're coming to them for the first time without having dipped into the Apple earbud system before they are definitely the best sounding and the most rounded of all the options that you can choose from right now including for me the airpods of third generation so for my ears the sound profile definitely has more emphasis on the bass than any other Apple earbud that I've tested but it is balanced in such a way so I don't feel like I need to constantly crank the volume to also hear that definition in the mids and The Trebles like I do on some other wireless earbuds still I am craving a user adjustable equalizer from the settings app rather than relying on the Adaptive equalizer all the time as great as it is even when I'm switching between musical genres I just like extra customization the active noise canceling also gets a boost that I wasn't expecting to make as much difference as it actually does my colleague David carnoy's review which is great and I highly recommend you give it a watch right up here goes into detail about how the ANC is improved across the range of frequencies and he does a great job of explaining this even further but to cut a long story short in all the situations that I've used the noise cancellation so even when I'm trying to mute out the sounds of the waves at the beach when I'm on a phone call it's been noticeably improved over the first generation adaptive transparency Mode still continues to surprise me and two months in I still get kind of a bit of a shock when it does kick in sometimes now this helps to lower the volume of external sounds that are above an 85 decibel threshold and for me I found it most helpful on walks that's usually when I rely on transparency mode to keep an ear out for my surroundings but say a loud rumbling truck goes past and then density is muted a lot more than it would be if I didn't have this mode on but I do feel the effect could be a little bit more subtle or gradual sometimes when it does kick in I feel it goes from Full ambient transparency mode and then feeling like somehow I've suddenly turned on active noise cancellation when I wasn't looking and live listen it's still my favorite secret spying tool no just just kidding I would never use my earbuds for nefarious purposes so if you're not familiar with live listen it's basically letting you use your iPhone as a microphone to pick up audio while you're wearing the airpods and echoing them to your ears now this is not new on the airpods Pro 2 but I'm still actually surprised at how many people don't know this exists so definitely try it out and it is great for accessibility now on a more serious note the other accessibility options on the airpods Pro 2 are really thorough whether that's adjusting the click stem speed or adjusting how exactly that transparency mode works to having things like background sounds and I unexpectedly really love background sounds again not new to the airpods Pro 2 but sometimes I do leave these in my ears even when I'm not on a call or listening to music and then through the accessibility menu you can toggle on soothing background sounds like the ocean or something like rain battery life is better than the original airpods Pro in terms of overall listening time I'm generally averaging between five and a half to six hours with moderate volume using transparency mode Now using active noise cancellation does drop that a little bit further but I do find actually anecdotally I feel like I am charging the case itself a little bit more than I did with the originals so what's next well I really hope that there's going to be some sort of high resolution audio playback support in the future yes obviously Bluetooth does have its limitations but maybe there's something extra that can be unlocked in a future update especially given that Apple music now supports lossless audio Apple's done something similar before with the first generation airpods Pro if you do remember back in 2020 they suddenly got this spatial audio feature when the software support unlocked the capabilities of the built-in gyroscope and accelerometer a year after they were originally launched so I'm still holding out hope true multi-point connectivity is still one of those features that I do miss the most when I come from some other wireless earbuds and while Apple's quick switching between devices signed into the same Apple ID does offer some relief and it does work really well it doesn't quite go all the way for me in my particular use case if I'm switching say between my work MacBook and an iPhone well obviously like I'm not going to sign into my personal Apple ID on my work computer because you know like maybe that's a niche really Niche example but I'm sure you could also be in the same situation as me now having true multi-point here would be a really nice option to be able to connect two devices at the same time without manually needing to toggle on or just rely that it's going to pick up when I'm switching between them now the other part of the equation that's left out is how these actually fare with an Android phone now I haven't spent enough time with them on Android as I usually tend to gravitate to another set of earbuds like the Sony xm4s when I am using an Android phone but I'm always interested to hear of your experience and if you are interested in a breakout video about airpods and Android let me know I will get testing So In Sum the airpods Pro 2 not perfect but they have almost everything I wanted in the original airpods Pro and I really enjoy using these earbuds but what have they been like for you I'm curious to know how they're holding up and what your experience has been like as always the comments are open and you can find me on your favorite social media platform like subscribe and all that jazz I'll see you later [Music],AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds,I'm really surprised at how much I like these wireless

43,ocwXowAOr2E,Apple AirPods Pro 2 Review (Gen 2) | The new buds to beat?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocwXowAOr2E,Digital Trends, the new Apple airpods Pro Gen 2 of arguably the most popular wireless earbuds available Apple claims they're even better than before but how are they better what's new what's been improved and by how much most importantly should you buy them you've got questions I've got answers [Music] welcome back everyone I'm Caleb Dennison and this is my review of the second generation Apple airpods Pro I've been looking forward to these coming out for well over a year now why because for all of the excellent wireless earbuds and headphones I get to test all of which spend at least some time in my backpack the Apple airpods Pro have assumed permanent residency in my bag they go everywhere with me so a new and improved version of my go-to buds yes please so whether you already own airpods Pro and an upgrade is a foregone conclusion or you never jumped on the airpods pro bandwagon and you're wondering if the hype is real and if they're worth the premium price or you just want to see if the airpods pro really are all that I think you're gonna love this video and if you do let me know by slapping it with a like subscribe if you want to see more okay let's dive in so when I started in on this review I told myself I was not going to constantly compare the New Gen 2 airpods Pro to the Gen 1 version then as I started testing them I realized that was not only unavoidable but but probably the best way to talk about the New Gen 2 version so let's start with the case it is indistinguishable in size and shape from the OG and although the scale says it's got a few more grams on it I can't tell what is meaningfully different is that you can now charge the airpods pro using an Apple Watch charger and that's in addition to the Qi wireless charging and of course the lightning cable option there's also a hole for a lanyard here and apple will gladly sell you one for 13 bucks sorry you don't get one in the box but my favorite part is the built-in speaker not only does it chime when you start charging the case or the buds but it will help you find the case if you misplace it which honestly I've done more often than I'd like to admit the case holds about the same amount of charge as before but the second gen airpods Pro buds themselves I'm happy to report do indeed last a little bit longer with ANC turned on I got them to last for about 6 hours and 12 minutes before they died on me the case will recharge them four more times so you're looking at a little over 30 hours of use before you will have to charge the case now that's not industry leading battery life but I think it's plenty practical and besides I'm less fixated on that battery number than I am on the overall performance of the earbuds which I'm about to dig into oh one more thing about the case it is now ipx4 rated just like the airpods themselves in the box you'll get one more size of ear tips for a total of four options including the tips that come pre-installed it's those extra small tips that personally I think matter most but that's because I know someone who has a hard time finding in-ear buds that will work with their tiny ears and the airpods pro are now perfect for them to make sure you get the best seal which I cannot stress enough is absolutely essential toward getting the best sound quality the best passive noise isolation and the best active noise canceling Apple has built this trick little test into the airpods pro Settings app I tested it and it actually works the default ear tips have always worked best for me but I tried them all and the test let me know when I had a size too large or small for my ears guiding me right back to the Goldilocks tips that were on the earbuds in the first place now taking a closer look at the earbuds themselves Apple has improved its in-use detector with skin detection which is great because now they won't activate and waste battery if you stuff them in your pocket or handbag or whatever it knows the difference between your jeans and your skin now part of the redesign that Apple didn't mention during their announcement is that they work to improve wind noise abatement there have been subtle changes in the stem here so that the microphones are less susceptible to wind interference in the first place then of course you have apple wind noise reduction built into the H2 chip as well which I'll get into momentarily so with a quick Refresh on some of the new stuff you can see let's get to the stuff that really matters right that's call Quality ANC and transparency mode quality and of course sound quality let's start with call Quality and for that I'm going to step outside welcome to a bustling thoroughfare in downtown Portland Oregon this is a place where you might have buses going by a light rail train honking its horn Fatboy motorcycles and super impressive with Mufflers that aren't designed to muffle Jack Squat and of course you've got emergency vehicles and their sirens sounds that on their own are already kind of noisy but when they all happen together can really cause some troubles in fact they're the source of many frustrated lost takes in our studio at times now on their own these sounds are already kind of annoying but you don't want them bleeding through on a business call if you're walking around taking a business call you don't want people necessarily aware that you're out and about on a busy City street and the airpods pro do an exemplary job of just knocking that noise out now the voice Clarity itself isn't perfect even in a completely silent environment like our studio here you can tell I'm on wireless headphones as opposed to speaking on my actual phone but when it comes to call Quality short of using a wired microphone and a silent office it just doesn't get much better than the airpods pro and that was already true now with the second gen it's just a little bit better background noises are squashed from a hush to a whisper okay now to talk about noise canceling and transparency mode so first off it's called adaptive transparency mode now and that adaptive part I love it so if you've seen my reviews of the original airpods Pro or the airpods max then you know I consider Apple's transparency mode to be the best in the business I've described it as the next best thing to not having headphones on at all because it's pretty realistic well now I actually feel like in some cases adaptive transparency mode can sound better than real life the Adaptive part basically means that if a ridiculously loud noise happens while you're in transparency mode then the airpods pro are going to stomp down on that a little bit they won't cancel it out or anything I mean if someone honks their car horn at you because they're about to cream you as you cut them off on your bike then you need to hear that horn what you don't need is for the sudden insanely loud car or truck horn to be Amplified by your headphones all but guaranteeing a heart attack from the scare Apple's example of a jackhammer is probably better but you get it right you can enjoy transparency mode without having Extremely Loud Noises piped in and harshing your Chill Vibes on the other end of the spectrum is noise canceling which Apple's somewhat dubiously claims is twice as effective as the original airpods Pro does that mean that everything is twice as quiet are we talking about half the decibels of noise making it through or that they can handle noises that are twice as loud no none of those things are true look I'm no math wizard but I know that Apple has many math Wizards on staff and I'm sure that it's on solid legal footing when it makes that claim as much as I'd like to go on a rant here let's not get hung up on that statistic though the bottom line is that the new airpods Pro have more effective noise canceling but really in what way is it more effective well to be sure Apple's claim that it more effectively cancels high frequency noise is absolutely true I went to the coffee shop in my building where I can always count on boisterous Baristas to make plenty of conversational noise even if there's nobody else in the space and sure enough the second gen airpods Pro quieted down people's voices more effectively and this is without any music or podcast audio going just a and C on its own I also tested them with a white noise pattern playing on some speakers and it was clear that more high frequencies were cut there as well and for the ultimate test I compared the airpods pro to the Sony wh-1000xm5 over ear headphones and while I feel like the xm5 cut noise out slightly more than the airpods pro I was really surprised at how close it was I can't wait to take the airpods pro on a flight next week for the ultimate test so I'll say this the second gen airpods Pro so have better ANC and I'd argue some of the best ANC out there period if you want to use them just to quiet the world down they'll do that without the aid of music or any other audio but once you start playing music movies or podcasts that's it the world around you is gone in the world of earbuds I think only the Bose qc2 can hold a candle to the airpods pro now let's talk about sound quality and in order to make this meaningful for you I need to take you through the experience I had testing and comparing so I started out like I always do listening to certain tracks I always use when testing audio gear at first just listening to the new airpods Pro then later going back and forth between the new 2nd gen and the first gen and I was having a tough time hearing the differences but not because they weren't there to hear I was getting distracted by how the differences in sound quality varied as I tried to get the volume or technically the loudness equalized between the two see it seemed like I needed to turn turn the Gen 1 up to match the volume of the Gen 2 but then I realized the Gen 1 were actually too loud when I did that but when I was sure I had the overall volume as balanced as I could get it I noticed that the Gen 2 seemed like they had a fuller more even tempered sound and that's when I realized that it was actually Apple's adaptive EQ that was coming into play and then it was working way better on the second gen airpods Pro when you're listening at lower volumes the Gen 2 airpods Pro Sound full and well balanced they almost don't seem as quiet even at those lower levels though the average decibel level was clearly brought down and at higher volumes the second gen hold together better there's less Distortion and better overall balance now I don't know how much of the difference I'm hearing is due to the new driver how much is due to the new amplification and how much is the new H2 chip processing and honestly I don't care the second gen airpods PRO Sound sound better the overall bass response seems similar it's got a little punch a reasonable amount of depth it's never bloated or flabby the mid-range is open and uncolored but it's the high frequencies especially that enjoy the most audible Improvement the transit response of symbols and guitar strings the overtones of brass instruments and acoustic piano the organic sound of acoustic drums and percussion all of it just sounds great like with the original airpods Pro I said they sounded more than good enough for most folks but with the second gen airpods Pro I think they're worth taking a really close listen to they definitely have their own sound signature and I think it's one that most folks will love not just like but actually love people are gonna eat these up no doubt the airpods pro will be going where I go they're staying in the bag I mean I use an iPhone an Apple Watch and iPad and lately I've been using an Apple TV more often still haven't switched to Mac don't know if that will ever happen but the airpods pro make a lot of sense anyway since I use a fair number of Apple products thing is the new airpods Pro are more than just practical they're a treat to use the ANC is Top Notch the transparency mode can't be beat the case is easy to find they fit well and they sound really good even if you aren't an Apple user I think you have to admit these are just a remarkably solid set of earbuds and if you are an Apple user well I say run don't walk and get yourself a set you'll be thrilled you did thanks as always for watching everyone as earbuds go what's your all-time favorite set let me know down in the comments don't forget to like And subscribe and here's two other videos I think you might like,AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds,The new Apple airpods Pro Gen 2 of arguably the most popular wireless earbuds available Apple claims they're even better than before.How are they better what's new what's been improved and by how much most importantly should you buy them you've got questions. The second gen airpods Pro have more effective noise canceling but really in what way is it more effective well to be sure Apple's claim that it more effectively cancels high frequency noise is absolutely true I went to the coffee shop in my building where I can always count on boisterouss to make plenty of conversational noise even if there's nobody else in the space and sure enough the second gen airpods Pro quieted down people's voices more effectively.Apple's somewhat dubiously claims that everything is twice as quiet are we talking about half the decibels of noise making it through or that they can handle noises For the ultimate test I compared the airpods pro to the Sony wh-1000xm5 over ear headphones.While I feel like the xm5 cut noise out slightly more than the airpods pro I was really surprised at how close it was I can't wait to take the airpods pro on a flight next week for the ultimate test.The second gen airpods Pro so have better ANC and I'd argue some of the best ANC out there period if you want to use them just to quiet the world down they'll do that without the aid of music or any other audio.
44,sgNwFcTCjLM,AirPods Pro 2 Review: Earbud Nirvana,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgNwFcTCjLM,CNET, [Music] hey there ever since the airpods Pro 2 were first announced on September 7th for 249 dollars people keep asking me so how much better are they than the originals well putting an exact percentage on how much they've improved isn't so easy but that's what I'm gonna try to do in this review I'm also going to try to give you an idea how they stack up against some of the other top new earbuds out there here we go let's start with the external design this is one of those situations where Apple hasn't really done anything to change the size and shape of the buds for significantly alter their physical appearance the original airpods Pro were compact and lightweight and fit a lot of people's ears really well so I can't fault that decision some people were hoping for shorter stems perhaps some new color options or even better water resistance yes they're still ipx4 Splash proof but I figured Apple would stick with its tried and true design and focus on making improvements to the airs that had the most room for improvement like sound quality noise canceling performance and battery life which is now up to six hours from about 4.5 hours with noise canceling on there are some small but noteworthy changes to the design particularly to the microphones placement on the original airpods Pro the skin detection sensor and noise canceling microphone were combined on the inside of the bud now they're separated with the skin detection sensor in the same spot but the noise canceling microphone has been moved to the top of the Bud where it's exposed to the outside world and better at picking up and processing Ambient sound the microphone configuration is similar to what you see on the airpods 3 but the skin detection sensor is actually smaller and apple says it's improved the sensor to more accurately turns on and off playback and is more energy efficient I should also mention that Apple now includes a four set of extra small ear tips which should help those of you with really small ears who had trouble getting a secure fit with the originals but this isn't like the third generation airpods where Apple made big changes to the earbuds external design as far as I can tell these fit my ears the same as the originals I personally would like apple included a new extra large ear tip but I do get a relatively good seal with the largest size that is included I could probably do just a little bit better with an XL tip and I sometimes use third-party foam tips to get a more secure fit they have a little bit more grip and that helps keep the buds very securely in my ears particularly when I'm running with them the new magsafe enabled wireless charging case is the same size but now has a built-in speaker and Apple's U1 chip which allows it to play sounds for use with Apple's Precision find my feature previously the buds could play a sound through their drivers but often they were in the case so you couldn't hear that sound now you can use find my to locate the case or the left or right earbuds separately should one or all of them go missing case also now has a spot for attaching a lanyard but sadly Apple doesn't include a lanyard with the buds while Apple has retained the pinch controls on the stems which I preferred to the touch controls on the original airpods it's now added swipe controls on the stems for adjusting the volume you can still ask Siri to raise and lower the volume these do have hands-free Siri but a lot of people will appreciate the new swipe controls that's really it as far as external design changes go and most of them are tied into some feature or performance enhancement as I said my initial first look video the real changes are on the inside where everything is basically new the airpods Pro 2 are powered by Apple's new H2 chip which delivers more processing power while being more energy efficient to get better sound apples combine that chip with a new amplifier and new low Distortion drivers along with new digital processing algorithms the H2 new microphones and algorithms are also what Drive the improved adaptive active noise canceling that Apple says is double as powerful as its predecessors noise canceling and finally there's a new adaptive transparency mode that allows you to hear the world around you in a natural lifelike manner while reducing loud noises that might normally shock your ears it's a great transparency mode and you can turn off the Adaptive part if you want you can definitely hear the improvements to both the noise canceling and the sound as for the sound you get better Clarity more bass punch with better definition than just more all-around depth and dynamic sound the sound just has a little more girth and three-dimensionality to it I compared a few tracks I always use during testing like spoons knock knock knock and you can really notice a difference in the Bass Performance one of the more impressive things about the buzz is how loud they play for me anyway I found they played plenty loud at about 65 to 70 volume I compared them to the new Bose quiet Comfort earbuds 2 the airpods Pro 2 sound excellent but there's something about the tonal balance of the bows that I liked a little better at times there's a little bit more warmth than naturalness to it and the bass has a bit more oomph but on the Bose I had to push the volume up to about 85 percent to hear some of the finer details and to get that extra bass kick with the airpods Pro 2 you hear more detail and get good bass even at more moderate volume levels I will say that the noise canceling is impacted by how tight of seal you get from the ear tips that said it was easy to sense that it was reducing more cab noise during a flight I took and also muffled more sound when I rode the subway in New York the buds also have just enough venting to avoid that oppressive occluded feeling you sometimes get with ANC buds the noise canceling didn't feel twice as strong to me but by double the noise canceling power what apple means is the noise canceling is improved across all frequencies and probably more so with high and mid-range frequencies that are harder to muffle than lower frequencies so you're likely to hear more improvement with the muffling of people's voices for example the noise canceling is one of the best out there right now and just a slight step behind what experience with Bose's new quiet Comfort earbuds too which arguably have the best noise canceling at the moment some people were hoping that the new airpods Pro would be able to stream apple lossless tracks over Bluetooth they currently can't do that which will certainly disappoint some people whether they will be able to do that in the future and possibly get other new feature upgrades is anybody's guess but for now they use Bluetooth 5.3 and support the AAC lc3 audio codec which offers 16-bit 48 kilohertz bit rates compared to the 16-bit 24 kilohertz bit rates of AAC not high resolution audio but a little bump up I'm not going to talk much about Apple's spatial audio virtual surround mode but it's here and fun to play around with I prefer using it with movies but I also try to with various music tracks particularly those that apple designates as made for spatial audio it doesn't necessarily make music sound better but it does make it sound different it's interesting to try it out with tracks you know well and want to hear in a different way iOS 16 brings personalized spatial audio to any airpods that support spatial audio the personalized experience comes from taking pictures of your ears and the biggest benefit is the more accurate placement of dialogue directly in front of you when you're watching a movie that placement doesn't move even if you turn your head the original airpods Pro were very good for making voice calls and so were these as I said the microphones have been upgraded and there are two beam forming microphones for calls one on the outside of the bud and one on the bottom of the stem both of which have some mesh covering them to help reduce wind noise when you're using the buds to make a FaceTime call over Wi-Fi instead of a call over a cellular network but the audio gets compressed people may be able to notice a bigger difference in the clarity of your voice compared to what they would hear with the original airpods Pro but have a listen to the test call we made on Verizon cellular network all right on the streets of New York doing a test call with fellow editor John Falcone how do I sound John there's a lot of traffic around me there's a little bit of wind before but there's definitely a lot of traffic so if you're outside and surrounded by a lot of traffic I'd say you sound very good to excellent I hear a tiny bit of that in the background but uh can hear your voice nice and clearly and then um just a very clear experience on my end for the most part all right I'm going to talk a little bit more so you get a sample of my voice as I'm talking as traffic is going by uh there isn't as much wind as it was before so it can't fall but at least so that but this is what my voice sounds like on the airpods Pro to making a call as I said in the beginning it's hard to put an exact number on just how much better the new airpods Pro 2 are compared to their predecessor but I'm going to go with somewhere around 40 percent the fact is that when the airpods pro came out almost three years ago it was really their compact size comfortable fit and Apple only features like Auto switching being all the devices on your iCloud account that were their big selling points that's all here still but now the sound and noise canceling which were good but not great before are what you'd expect from a 249 dollar set of earbuds audio quality is very subjective and some people may slightly prefer the Sonic traits of buzz like the bows I mentioned earlier but the Sony wf-1000x mark IV or sennheiser's momentum true Wireless 3 all of which have equalizer options in their companion apps but others may actually prefer the airpod Pro 2 sound it really does stack up well against what you get with other premium earbuds in this price range and it's particularly impressive considering how small and lightweight the earbuds are they'll pair with Android devices but you do lose a lot of their special features including spatial audio so Android users are going to be better off with buds like Google's pixel buds Pro or Samsung's Galaxy buds 2 Pro or the Bose I mentioned earlier and you may find that other buds like the Bose or even Apple's own Beats fit Pro which don't sound quite as good or offer quite as good noise canceling or voice calling performance may fit your ears more securely You may wish Apple had made the airpods Pro 2 look a little different than the originals and while they may not quite be perfect they feel like a more fully evolved refined product it's pretty hard to beat for Apple users so long as they fit your ears we have links in the description to some of the products I've mentioned and you can

45,2VkL2U2dtBI,Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro 2 review: the BEST $249 you will spend on audio in 2022,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VkL2U2dtBI,Darko Audio, this video is brought to you by audioquest makers of the dragonfly range of USB Dax click to audioquest.com for more information I don't really know how to start this video actually because well this is the airpods Pro from Apple the original but then recently I bought the version 2 the second generation airpods Pro from Apple So today we're going to look at this one and talk about how it compares to the original and also some Sony true Wireless iems thank you [Music] thank you [Music] it's Bonkers to think really that we've only had active noise cancellation inside true Wireless iems for about three years the first I believe were the Sony wf-1000 xm3 now I liked those but I didn't love them however the the following generation the xm4 I really fell hard for those last year and we made a video about those over in the tiergarten over there and in that video we discussed how the Sony wf-1000xm4 stacked up against the original airpods Pro and it was obvious to me that the Sony gave us better noise cancellation both passive and active because they seal more of the year off initially which I think makes lighter work for the DSP and its active noise cancellation smarts and the Sony were also better for music playback they sounded Fuller richer more dynamic they punched harder they weren't perfect but at that time for me they were the best that I'd heard to date for listening to music and by contrast the Sony made the original airpods PRO Sound a bit dry a bit papery and somewhat irritating when listening to music and sometimes the airpods pro would sound a little bit sibilant and also somewhat congested in the low end because they try and sort of cram sub bass mid bass all into sort of one zone or at least that's how it it sounded to me on some yeah on more bass Heavy Music and to that end I would never recommend the original airpods Pro to any music fan but I kept them around for two reasons they were absolutely wonderful to wear for a long long period of time the comfort factor Sky High way better than the the Sony wf-1000xm4 and that also made the airpods pros The Originals better for podcasts because you only really need a fairly basic sound to I guess hear what's going on in the podcast I think so anyway and it also made them better for phone calls and better for long phone calls and better for long podcasts because of that Sky High comfort factor and in the end at the end of last year I found myself using two different true Wireless IMs I would pick up the Sony if I wanted to go out and listen to music but not really if I wanted to make a phone call a quick phone call would be fine but if it was a long phone call I would go and pick up the Apple airpods Pro or if I was listening to a podcast again I would pick up the apples [Music] foreign [Music] so three years after the original airpods Pro and a year after we made our video Apple have introduced airpods Pro number two they appear on the phone with a hash or a pound sign as the Americans say now I wasn't going to buy a pair because of my general sort of frustrations with the originals with music playback but a music producer friend in Los Angeles who had bought a pair suggested I really reconsider that position so just before I took five days vacation in Spain I went up to my local Apple Store and I bought a pair of the airpods pro generation two so what's new well the case is now part of the find my software solution that comes with an iPhone so you can find it if you lose it there's also a speaker on the bottom that makes sounds when you drop the case onto a wireless charging pad or connected to a lightning cable and speaking of charging the case now works with magsafe charges and with the Apple watch charger which I've used it with very useful and we get better battery life apparently according to Apple from the second generation airpods Pro we get six hours from a full charge from the case instead of the previous generations four hours the earphones themselves are nearly indistinguishable from the original they're the same shape so you could probably quite easily drop an old one into a new case mistakenly thankfully the software in an iPhone will now tell you if you've done that it will tell you if you put the wrong airpod into your second gen airpods Pro case the tips are also the same shape and I think the mesh has been changed a little bit by Apple but you can still put a say a gen 1 tip on a Gen 2 airpods Pro or vice versa so that means that if you're a fan of third party tips and I am generally speaking then those will still work on your second gen airpods Pro 2 you won't need to buy a new set the vent placement on the new airpods pro has been relocated presumably for improved sound quality but in this stem we now get volume control so you can swipe up or down on that stem to change the volume and what I really like about that is we get audible feedback so we get a tiny donk sound when we've successfully swiped up or down and that works on either of the airpods so it can work on the left one or the right one foreign [Music] apple is loudly touting the presence of its new H2 chip which according to them gives us much better computational audio functionality and I've got to say the new transparency mode is freaky good and if you've got a pair of airpods Pro 2 I invite you to try this like put transparency mode on because I did this on an airplane last week I put transparency mode on and then I took one of the airpods out of my ear to try and hear the difference the difference is there but it's not huge right so the the finding there is that transparency mode is very very very very very close to real life which I think is astonishing and if you do that same transparency mode experiment with the Sony wf-1000xm4 you notice a much darker difference between the earphone being in and transparency mode being on and then just pulling it out you can definitely hear the Sony processing and it just sounds more echoey and the second gen airpods Pro gives us much better active noise cancellation which I think is now on par with the Sony apart from wind rejection because Sony has a mode in its app that actively and success successfully tackles wind noise that kind of just blasts over the over the earpieces as you're walking along or if you're moving on a bike I know you shouldn't necessarily do that on a street but maybe in a park or in the country or when you've got transparency mode on it's fine however wind noise is still a problem on the airpods pro second gen just as it was on the first gen that's why I changed my tips out for a third-party solution to help mitigate some of that wind noise issue and it did but it also it caused a hit to the low frequency response of the earphone but of course I wasn't really listening to music through the original airpods Pro so I didn't really mind that but as we'll see with the airpods pro version two yeah I'm not keen to change to a third-party tip talking of tips in order to get the most from active noise cancellation from the second gen airpods Pro and also the first gen really it's really important to get a good seal it's really important to choose the right tip now Apple have done something really cool here is that in the iPhone this doesn't exist on Android really what I'm what I'm talking about today is mostly for iPhone users so inside the iPhone there is a section in the settings that tests whether or not the the seal inside the ear is good now I think this is brilliant because many people might not know you know if they're not audio nerds like us they might not know that the Seal of an earphone is fundamental to its sound quality so it's great that Apple are now communicating that message to every airpods user airpods pro version 2 user Olaf has just reminded me that the Sony's also do that they also test for the quality of the ear tip seal inside the app and these improvements to active noise cancellation to transparency mode plus the ongoing Sky High comfort factor still make the airpods pro in their second gen form my pick for podcasts and phone calls foreign [Music] [Music] but but the biggest news with the second generation airpods Pro is that apple have changed up the drivers and the amplifiers that control those drivers now I know a lot of noise is made about the Codex right so airpods Pro in fact all Apple earphones and headphones they only include support for AAC because that's all that's in an iPhone so you're only going to get an AAC codec connection working with Apple airpods products which I think is totally fine maybe it's not quite as good as aptex maybe it's not quite as good as ldac but the hardware inside our Bluetooth headphones the drivers the amplifiers the DSP that has a much greater impact on what we hear than the codec in play Let's talk about sound quality by pulling on some side-by-side comparisons so the second gen airpods Pro compared to the first gen I think the second gen are area they no longer sort of panty Bunch the bass we get clear separate bass and then sub Bass the sibilance issue I think is pretty much gone my only criticism really is sometimes I wish vocals were a bit further forward they're a little bit recessed sometimes but not always and it's certainly not a deal breaker now because the second generation airpods Pro have a much Fuller sound a much richer sound a much punchier sound as well yeah full Rich Punchy I kind of say that a lot don't I but it's kind of true when you kind of get this sort of more voluptuous weightier heft from either a pair of speakers or in this case a true Wireless IM and that extra heft and weight and fullness that we get from the new airpods Pro puts them for me on par with the Sony but with Superior overall Clarity the new airpods Pro to me sound more transparent I'm not going to say Closer To Source but more transparent than the Sony now the Sony Sound yeah they sound chunkier and a bit bigger but they also sound comparatively muddier than the airpods pro second gen foreign [Music] so not only do we get a better sound from the airpods pro version 2 with greater Clarity we also get Superior phone call Performance remember this is one of the the things I loved about the original airpods that's been carried over into version two apart from wind noise that's still a little bit of an issue I don't want to switch over to a third party tip with a new one because I'm worried that's going to compromise the the base response of this new version which I cannot I just don't want to give up any bass response because it's so it's so good comparatively speaking in the second gen airpods Pro the new apples are easier to control than the Sony because we now have volume control on the stems obviously the Sony still have the tap on the right for pause and then the tap for transparency mode on the left that's good but it's it's a bit trickier to control volume with the Sony than it is with the the airpods pro version two I thought tricky is probably the wrong word it's just the Apple sort of haptics now with the swipe control I just think it's a more elegant solution one thing that's not in doubt here is that the apples are far more comfortable for longer periods than the Sony's and all of that means that I now pick up the Apple airpods Pro 2 more often than the Sony wf-1000xm4 and that's because the new airpods Pro are I think more of an all-rounder than the the Sony true Wireless IMS that I previously infused about so are the Apple airpods Pro second generation the best true Wireless IEM available right now well no it's the short answer I mean they are very much a jack of all trades I do not mean that pejoratively they are excellent in many many different ways especially with Apple watch integration which I use a little bit and also with the handoff to the mac and back it's super smooth and super quick nowadays to be able to move from say an iPhone to a Mac and back again with your audio and also love the ear tip seal tester inside the iPhone that's a lovely touch but there is a true Wireless IEM out there available right now for less money than the Apple airpods Pro generation 2 that I think with music sounds quite a bit better and we'll come to that in the next video but if you like this video please consider giving us a like down below if you like my attitude towards well it's not even high-end audio this is just audio really and I must admit at the moment with this run of Bluetooth headphone videos I'm indulging myself so normally I have to you know when I decide what I'm going to make a video about I have to sort of way up what my audience would like against what I would like to do and try and find a sort of where they meet in the middle and sometimes it's closer to what I would like and sometimes it's close to what my audience would like this one is very much about my own curiosity right I bought these airpods Pro 2nd gen with my own money thanks to a nudge from yeah my buddy in LA and I'm really glad I did and I'm hoping that you're glad that I investigated these on this channel and if you if you are glad then please consider subscribing to this channel because we've got plenty of more Bluetooth noise canceling headphone stuff coming believe it or not I'm on a tear right now so yeah subscribe to this channel if you dig there and as always thank you ever so much for watching I should say something about spatial audio as it relates to Apple music because that's what I mainly listen to Apple music with the with the Apple airpods Pro second gen when I was in Spain last week now Talking Heads have just issued their entire catalog in spatial audio I'm not sure yet if this has been directly pulled from the surround sound mixes that were done for the brick box set from 2005 was it 2006 whatever it is not sure about that yet but whatever it is I've got to say and I think Jerry Harrison did this his he made these albums sound new all over again I was playing track after track in Spain going this is just like another world truly I know that they've been slightly remixed so in some tracks we can hear more of sort of David Burns quirky vocals we can hear more synth textures better bass lines this is the thing with a good spatial audio mix behind stereo headphones because it's all done in DSP with stereo headphones we get better separation that's the the key takeaway for me with spatial is that everything is separated this way and this way it is astonishing and I would urge you to go and listen to the talking head stuff on Apple music if you've got a pair of Apple earphones or headphones because it really is quite remarkable what Jerry Harrison has done now this is the thing though is that not every artist has done that in fact there is so little spatial audio out there relatively speaking there's even less than there is of high res so I have to temper my enthusiasm because yeah Talking Heads are my favorite band of all time so of course I'm going to be excited when they come out in spatial and it sounds good but there's very little other music that's this good or but also there's very little other music in spatial period so yeah um I don't want to get carried away about sort of spatial sorry Dolby Atmos inside spatial is what I should really call it I can't really get too carried away about that just yet but I do think that if Dolby Atmos or sort of surround sound versions of albums I mean surround sound is kind of a misnomer really because you don't feel like it's a sound is coming from behind you it's just the separation thing that I think is the big advantage if that I think the headphone Market is where it's going to take off I really don't think that many people at all are going to rewire their homes with an Atmos system I just I think even 5.1 was too much of an ask for most people that might be okay with wireless implementations of say 4.1 or 5.1 if it's possible but really I think if Dolby Atmos slash spatial is going to take off it will be the headphone Market that drives this and on streaming services like apple so yeah I just think that the the stuff that is available in spatial on Apple music really ices the cake of the new airpods Pro generation 2. and it was and yeah and the Sony were also better for music for music and that also made the airpods pro The Originals better for podcasts because because however a music producer friend in Los Angeles ah so three years after Apple introduced the airpods pro and a year since we made a video about them Apple have now so functionally the sorry sorry sorry when you drop it on a on a wireless charging God's sake a normal sort of lightning socket okay what the hell try again the tips have also been changed slightly they're now the tips are also the same shape although I think the mesh has been changed just got to say John and so with that plus the other advantage with each earpod earpod no oh God what am I doing here Olaf okay,AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds,The original airpods Pro from Apple and the second generation airpods Pro from Apple.Airpods Pro number two appear on the phone with a hash or a pound sign.The original airpods PRO sound a bit dry a bit papery and somewhat irritating when listening to music and sometimes the airpods pro would sound a little bit sibilant and also somewhat congested in the low end. The second gen airpods Pro gives us much better active noise cancellation.Wind noise is still a problem on the airpods pro second gen just as it was on the first gen.In the iPhone there is a section in the settings that tests whether or not the the seal inside the ear is good. Second generation airpods Pro have a much Fuller sound a much punchier sound a much punchier sound as well yeah full Richy.The new apples are easier to control than the the Sony because we now have volume control on the stems.The ear tip seal inside the iPhone that's a lovely touch but there is a true Wireless IEM out there right now for less money than the Apple airpods Pro. Talking Heads have just issued their entire catalog in spatial audio.This is the thing with a good spatial audio mix behind stereo headphones.I would urge you to go and listen to the talking head stuff on Apple music if you've got a pair of Apple or headphones.

going into this with a completely open mind what I will say as far as the original airpod Pros I love these for the call Quality the sound quality was pretty good noise cancellation pretty good but if y'all watch my videos these did not make it into my top 10. so let's see if it's a new day and a new age okay no unboxing knife necessary nice white box yeah I know I like that giggity let's see what you get inside okay designed by Apple in California okay so you got your usual books and [ __ ] pluck them and follow them let's see uh no troll stickers today negative okay flick of the wrist this is going to be your hip-hop Pros okay more flick of the wrist okay Apple throwing something else in the Box okay no charging brick but you do got let's see this is going to be angle levels increasing okay you got USB type c to lightning charging cable and you got some different size ear tips now this is going to come with extra small small large and medium now typically medium is massage but we're going to try these out okay now let's take a look at the actual case and the earpods now right out of the gate I will say they look exactly the same okay let's see um but if you notice you got the speakers on the case now okay same lightning adapter lightning charging port on the bottom okay lanyard Loop now it didn't come with the lanyard that's a little bit disappointing it should have came with that little string okay parent button on the back about the same let's take a look at the airpods themselves okay classic apple look now one of the things that I will complain about right out of the gate is I wish these would have came in Black okay I hate the fact that everybody got the same color earpods that's one thing about the Galaxy buds you got color choices okay everybody don't want to have the same color especially White these are not very clandestine okay you want to rock these at work you want to rock some black earbuds okay look a little bit more discreet but it is what it is okay now these have all the events all of the mics everything is official tissue let's drop them back in okay and there it is okay now look now with the speaker you got a little sound okay that's new look at that okay all right so I'm gonna pause the video we'll pair these up and start our usual testing Talk Amongst yourselves all right Josh we'll be back in first let's check all of the different ways we can charge up the case now one of the things that I like already is the speaker built into the case it's going to let you get an alert when you're actually charging let's go ahead and plug it in you heard that little sound this is the lightning adapter next let's try the Apple watch charger okay charging up let's try magsafe charger okay charging up and let's try wireless charging pad there it is okay so all of the charging accessories work now let's take a look at the charging case again the same exact size as the OG airpod Pros on the front you got your LED indicator on the back Bluetooth pairing button on the bottom speaker Grille your lightning charging port and on one side you got a slot for your lanyard now let's check the magnet strength we're going to start with minimum shakage okay no movement intermediate shakage no movement maximum shrinkage ah no movement at all excellent strength on the magnets all right so now let's try the first time pairing process and see how easy this is okay we're gonna pop these open okay heard a little sound foreign okay I like these sounds coming out of the case let you know everything is working let's do this in real time okay there it is okay now you got your battery percentage for the airpods and your battery percentage for the case you hit continue just like that less than two minutes complete setup all right so before I go any further I'm gonna do my personalized spatial audio test say continue all right so let me set these up all right so now let's take a look at the app settings now in order to access this you're just going to go to your Bluetooth menu okay and select your airpods mines are named Captain Kirk because I'm Captain Kirk you got a battery percentage for your airpods and the charging case you got your noise control so you can turn on noise cancellation okay I just got extra quiet you can turn them off wow you could definitely hear the difference and transparency mode now I said this before and I'm going to say it again Apple makes the best transparency mode out of all of my earbuds now the Bose they did come in second right now but I love these okay these almost feel like you're not wearing earbuds at all now you got your touch controls for press and hold okay so I got mine set to noise cancellation and transparency mode make sure you do your ear tip fit test okay now like I said I like to use the medium size and they fit me perfectly you got adaptive transparency you got automatic air detection okay connect to this iPhone automatically personalized spatial audio your microphone you can enable your charging case sounds optimize battery charging show and find my okay now I'm going to test that in a minute I don't want to put my address on blast got accessibility all your serial numbers model numbers and your limited warranty simple and straightforward that is another way you can access this swipe down long press the volume and you can raise the lower the volume and quickly toggle between noise cancellation transparency mode and off now that kind of made me laugh just now a lot of times when you get cheap headphones or cheap earbuds when you're turning off and noise cancellation you don't really hear the difference these you hear the difference immediately like right now I got them off it just feels like I got two uh Q-tip stuffed in my ears when I put on noise cancellation it gets even more quiet but the transparency mode this is my favorite okay and you got your spatial audio simple and straightforward shoes tail is killing me all right simple enough all right now say you misplaced your airpods let's try to find my budge feature now I blocked out my address you're gonna hit play sound okay wait for it to connect now I don't know if y'all can hear that or not you hear that okay now if you want to uh the sound is playing let me cover up my address I can get directions right to it let's go ahead and activate that and now without showing y'all it's going to show you you see fastest route and I can navigate right to these would you hear that sound if it's quiet enough you'll definitely be able to find these all right so now let's talk about the look The feel and the fit pencil style earbuds y'all seen these a million and one times already okay here's how they look okay here's the other side okay all your touch controls are in the stems let's go ahead and drop these in and I'm using a medium-sized ear tips once you put them in your ears you're going to get a little chime boom to let you know that they're connected now initial Impressions they feel exactly like the airpod pros a nice comfortable tight fit very lightweight okay super lightweight now let me do the head shake test I'm going to start off with minimum Shake age okay no movement intermediate Shake Edge no movement and maximum shakage no movement at all now let me say this doing maximum shake it in the house is not really going to help you when you go to the gym now I'm speaking from experience I use my airpod Pros in the gym a couple of times if you're a heavy sweater alright if you sweat a lot now me I'll be sweating on some Harriet Tubman type [ __ ] when I do the Decon bench and I start getting extra moist giggity sweating all over the place these definitely start to move around that's why when I go to the gym I gotta use earbuds that have wings on it or hooks these are perfect for in your house running errands working doing day-to-day activities and light workouts but for heavy workouts I do not recommend earbuds without wings or hooks okay so let me slap these back in let me show you how they look okay I wish these was black they would have looked a little bit more discreet now y'all remember I used to call these the douche buds with that stem okay the original airpods had that long stem that was extra douchey the shorter stem I like these better now I used to hate these until I got the bno exes wow I fell in love with those and now I'm a big fan of the stem earbuds as long as they sound great and the side note y'all see me wearing glasses I shout out to all y'all four eyed bastions out there I'm part of the community now okay so now let's do the most important test the sound test all right so I got a classic song queued up we got Keyshia Cole I Should Have Cheated now I'm going to start off at max volume active noise cancellation turned on and spatial audio turned on okay here we go Birdman hands rubbing together I promise y'all I'm not gonna sing but I gotta give y'all one quick side note when this song first came out this was one of my favorite troll songs okay now go ahead and play this song at home I used to date this individual back in the days right when the song came out and choose to always accuse me of cheating every time I walk out the door so when this song came out every time I'm getting dressed to go out with my boys I would play this song I would sing the words mad loud then I would go out and cheat if you go to kids [ __ ] I'm gonna do it all right anyway that's all jokes aside here we go one time for playing pause like I said I promise I'm not gonna sing here we go okay okay all right shoes just left I think shoes know what time it is okay super loud oh crystal clear crystal clear first of all let me say you can't accuse me of all the things you know that you are guilty of and I see that it is easy for you to blame everything on me if that's the case I should go while I'm trying to do all the things you say I do boy I can't continue to take this from you I might as well have cheated on you as much as you accuse me you cheated I might as well yo these sound dope as much as you've accused me you're lying I'm might as well have come to the club as much as you've accused me a closet I might as well have no as much as you accuse me sometime with somebody told she saw you with some guy and I didn't accuse you of something that I didn't see myself realize okay um let's see if um let me take these out okay let me take these out automatic pause now look y'all know I was having way too but 20 times I was having a little flashback just now y'all loving it okay okay let me calm down okay reel it in force riveting I gotta be honest with y'all these sound great okay great excellent highs and mids now I gotta do a little uh bass test right now because that song doesn't have the maximum bass so I'm gonna go ahead and put these back in okay so y'all know for base let's take it over to let's do our nipsy Hustle matter of fact for this one we gotta go to YouTube music because I noticed this song sounds better on YouTube music doesn't does on Apple music okay blue laces too here we go okay okay let me calm down let me get ready this is the bass test okay blue laces too okay okay baby it's been somewhere okay let me be quiet okay here it goes okay okay okay um let's get it moogly they know that okay hold up let's take these out whoo now I do like the uh in ear detection once you pop them out they automatically pause your music I'm gonna do a quick test off camera but I know in my heart of hearts these definitely sound better than the original airpod Pros now I just I just y'all know this is one of my favorite songs I test all of my earbuds with these I was very underwhelmed I underwhelmed with the original airpod Pros that's why they didn't make it into my top ten these sounds substantially better now I don't want to just be talking out of my ass so I'm going to pause the video real quick I'm going to do a quick side by side test and I'm gonna come right back and let y'all know do these sound better than the originals all right so I just did a quick side by side test same iPhones same song Same settings and it's confirmed the new airpod Pros alright the airpod pro 2s definitely sound better than the ogs okay it's totally noticeable a lot of times you go from one version to the next version Galaxy buds to Galaxy buds too and they pretty much sound similar these sound way better than the originals way better okay now you got some actual bass now y'all know I am a bass head okay I like songs with heavy bass I like my music loud I like to go crazy I will say this these these are not blowing me away in the base Department the base is great but I don't think these are going to make it anywhere high in my top ten I'm now I'm about to I'm gonna tell I'm gonna talk about that in a minute we'll talk about that in a minute all right so let's get back to the regular testing all right so now let's check multi-point connection how fast can you switch between two Apple devices now if you notice airpods are connected on this one this one is not let's hit play on the music okay the music is playing we hit pause play on this one wait for it to switch look how fast that switched over now I'm on the second device let's hit pause let's hit play on the first device wait for the switch bong just like that excellent multi-point connection all right so now let's do the reconnection test how long did this take to reconnect your phone after you take them out and put them in the charging case you see they connected okay so let's drop these in the case one there's two hit close okay fully disconnected let's hear some music okay now here we go let's take them out One Mississippi to Mississippi two mississippis as soon as I said two Mississippi I heard the broom and you've seen it for yourself all right so two mississippis that's pretty Epic now let's do one of the most important tests that I do the one earbud test this is a Make It or Break It feature for a lot of y'all and it is for me too can you play music from One earbud while the other one is charging up in the case basically double in your battery life let's find out is it playing the music okay I'm going to take out the left earbud let's put it in the case left earbud is charging up the right side is playing okay so let's put the left side back in wait for it to reconnect okay it's connected now let's take out the right side drop it in the case charging up hit playing the music the left side is playing so this is excellent you can use either bit earbud independently basically doubling your battery life not a side note when I said the same thing about the Bose okay these do not work independently a lot of people are saying well if you want to just take the earbud out and leave it on the table and use one at a time that kind of defeats the purpose the whole purpose of using one earbud while the other one is charging up in the case is to double your battery life let me explain it if you work at a job for 10 hours straight okay the battery life on these is only six hours so right now I'm playing music out of my left earbud this one is charging up in the case after six hours okay I can take this one out put this one in and start listening to music again from this side okay so now I got a first six hours to listen to One earbud but one earbud is better than no earbuds that's why this chest is kind of important a lot of y'all working double shifts okay so later for six hours or ten hours you might be working 14 hours straight so you need as much battery as you can that's why the one earbud test is extremely important all right so now let's check the call Quality I'm going to call up Amaya okay let's get max volume yeah hi girlie you see now I I guess what I'm doing I'm shooting a video I was just about to say this is the time of the day that we need to be communicated okay not you know three o'clock in the morning you know what I'm saying that ain't that that ain't my hour bro I'm sorry that that what time is it over there oh yeah that's right that's right that's right what you doing okay minded the business all right well you know stop doing the same all right check this out check this out I'm doing an important video right now I need you to give me your honest no BS opinion I'm using some earbuds how do I sound really Claire all right now take take a guess what kind of earbuds these are yup I got the airpod pros the new ones yeah all right I'm gonna bless you with a pair though I'm gonna bless you with a pair all right so these sound crystal clear okay I gotta do one more test okay what about now do you hear any wind uh come on down man you are Apple's number one cheerleader what about now I got the win right by my you don't hit nothing all right I'm gonna buy you on my I love Apple t-shirt and send it to your door you you you know you all right anyway let me call you back after this video all right bye okay for some reason man Amaya and my brother they're apples they apples biggest uh nut swingers you know what I'm saying but it is what it is one thing I will say about airpods let me fix this little um the rubber the rubber always comes out when I take these out sometimes one thing I will say about airpods the core quality is amazing okay now a lot of times I could now Amaya is the reason I use a Maya is because that's the person I talk to every single day the most and I talked to her on a dozen different sets of headphones in it and earbuds and whenever we're having a conversation if we get into some real dirt you know some real deep thoughts and some real emotional stuff she'd be like Dad take whatever earbuds you got take those out and go put your earpods on because I need to hear you clear and you need to hear me clear airpod Pros all right the call Quality is amazing now on the side note I know Amaya was gonna jump on these so whenever I buy a set I had to buy one for her too she don't watch my video she'll she don't know I'm gonna give it give it to Seattle for dinner at dinner what am I talking about I'm going let me say that again I'm going to give them to a mine when I go to dinner with her next week she's coming back in town from college why am I telling y'all all of this I don't know anyway I'll be talking to y'all like we're just friends here I'm sorry all right anyway call Quality excellent let's keep it moving all right so now let's check for latency and what I mean by that is when you're watching the video is there any lip sync Delay from the person's lips to what you hear okay so I got my classic Larry David clip lamping okay no lip sync delay at all the spatial audio sounds incredible these are perfect for watching videos all right so now let's check the touch controls and on the side note when you're wearing the airpods the touch controls are on those little grooves on the inside now these have skin detection so watch as soon as the earbuds touch my skin they automatically connect all right so one tap for playing pause okay let's get a little tap okay the music is playing okay double tap to skip to the next song okay triple chapter go to reverse okay now for volume we're going to swipe down you see it's getting lower now to raise it we swipe up okay and for voice assistant hey Siri what's the weather for tomorrow okay now if you press and hold on either earbud that's going to cycle between noise cancellation and transparency mode so all of the touch controls work flawlessly all right so now I got to do the most annoying test that I do on this channel other than my singing voice the baby crying test we're gonna test for noise cancellation using a loud baby crying now fellas ladies if y'all got kids you heard this sound before if it's your baby it's pretty annoying but if it's somebody else's baby okay if you're on an airplane you're on the bus the train you're somewhere in public and somebody's baby is crying that is the number one annoying sound on this planet to me by far okay and whenever I travel this is the sound that I usually hear so that's why this test is near and dear to my heart so first right now I'm gonna start the baby I know fellas we got to do it for the name of science I'm gonna start the baby okay now I'm gonna put on noise cancellation okay now the sound drops drastically now I'm gonna play some music over the baby crying okay at max volume okay okay all right shut the [ __ ] up all right hold up all right now I gotta be honest with y'all I'm gonna rank these just for my in the house test okay now I got to take them outside and do some low intestine in the car now somebody just asked me to on the side note what does me testing in the car have to show anything anybody who ever heard my call before is way louder than an airplane engine okay so that's why I test the low end sitting in the car but in the house okay I'm gonna rank these y'all know I got three tiers we got trashed here okay tier and top tier and then we have the Covenant God cheer bows I'm gonna rank these as top tier because honestly I did hear a fate a little faintness of the baby crying just you know between little parts of the song I can hear a little bit just a just a tiny bit a tiny bit with the bows and the Sony's you don't hear [ __ ] all right you it's like there's no baby in the room at all when your music is playing okay so I'm gonna rank these as top tip but again let me take them outside and do a little bit more testing and we'll test out transparency mode as well all right so I just finished doing some thorough testing and here's the results now I did the range test I walked all the way to 50 feet no drop connection at all so excellent Bluetooth string next I test for transparency mode these are top tier transparency mode and I'm going to go on record right now and say these are my favorite transparency mode earbuds by far okay these are the earbuds if you're wearing these at work okay and you want to have a conversation you don't got to keep taking them out and putting them back in you could fully talk to somebody your voice is not going to sound like a robot you'll hear every single sound every snap you can hear your nails on the table every single thing is going to come in crystal clear top of the top tier for transparency mode now as far as active noise cancellation remember the three tiers I'm gonna rank these as high tier top tier okay not just top tier High tier top tier so that's one step below God dear okay one step below goddamn but One Step Above Top tier now the uh the uh Samsung's these are top tier I'm gonna rank these As One Step Above Top tier these are high tier top tier okay if that makes sense to y'all if it doesn't just understand this excellent active noise cancellation excellent now let me go ahead and wrap this video up but I want to answer those three questions all right so now let me answer those three questions number one are the airpod pro 2s really worth 250 bucks and the answer is yes without a doubt okay if you're heavy into the Apple ecosystem and you want to pay airpod Pros these are the ones to get the sound quality is fantastic they're nice and Loud the highs and mids crispy now you actually have some bass spatial audio is going to blow you away six hour battery life okay excellent call Quality you can use one earbud at a time these are a triple Major go without a doubt totally worth the price next question are these better than the original airpod pros and the answer is yes now like I said earlier sometimes you don't really get an upgrade from number one to number two this ain't one of those times okay this is a real upgrade these are blowing the number ones out of the water and the third question which ones are better the Galaxy buds Pro 2 or the airpod pro 2. let's find out all right so now we're going to settle this once and for all Samsung Knights versus the Apple Mafia who wins with the earbuds for 2022. now let me say this y'all know me I don't got no allegiances I don't got no brand loyalty I don't give a [ __ ] about Samsung I don't give a [ __ ] about Apple I only pledge allegiance to the hotness so whoever wins this competition is the winner now after this I don't want to hear no bitching I don't want to hear no crying I don't want to hear no excuses old floors you should have changed the EQ to this you shouldn't you know tweaked the settings on that these are both the flagship devices and both of them are set to my favorite optimal listening um listening EQ settings okay so we're going to start off with the Challenger okay the Challenger airpod Pros okay now I got one of my favorite songs pop smoke Christopher Walken max volume here we go okay now I'm not going to sing I'm actually going to listen for about about 10 seconds each wait for the bass drop okay here it goes okay send ahead and we gonna slide here that one with your wrap okay okay I ain't gonna front the new airpods they definitely sound crazy uh they definitely sound crazy let's throw in the Galaxy buds Pro 2. okay same song Here We Go okay okay here we go okay it's Birdman hands rubbing together okay send it how did we go slow every that might be around okay okay oh I have fun nights I'm gonna need y'all to stand down and stand by I gotta be honest with you I think I like the airpod pros better now this time I'm gonna do it real quick let's do that one more time okay okay quickly throwing the Samsungs okay okay yeah yeah I gotta be honest with y'all I gotta be totally honest with y'all they sound very similar all right very similar okay it's not a blowout but if I had to choose right now all right I'm going on a trip I'm catching a flight in 30 minutes somebody says which one you're gonna take the Galaxy and the Galaxy buds or the iPhone and the airpod pros I'm gonna go with the airpod pros okay I'm gonna go with the airpod pros the spatial audio okay the music sounds it sounds Fuller it sounds Fuller now I just want to show you how something real quick because I know Samsung Knights I already know what y'all typing oh 360 audio head tracking it's on everything is on you know what I'm saying everything is on everything is the same both of these I have noise cancellation turned off just the regular headphones okay and the regular regular earbuds headphones yeah I'm old school I say headphones the regular earbuds I'm gonna go with the airpod pros in terms of sound quality and I'm gonna do a quick test right now I'm not gonna kill y'all again I'm gonna do the baby crying test off camera and I'm gonna let y'all know which one has better ANC all right so I got one more special request now one of my longtime subscribers asked me if I could specifically test the Beats fit Pros versus the new airpod Pro 2s and give my opinion on which ones would be better for the gym now let me show you how to beat fit Pros now these are the Kim Kardashian exclusives okay you see the wing tips these are definitely going to be better for the gym for me because of the fit but let's see which one actually sounds better and has more Bass I'm gonna start with the fit Pros okay okay okay nice bass on these okay now let me try the iPod Pro 2s real quick while the sound is still fresh in my mind wow wow wow I gotta be totally honest with y'all the Beats fit Pros definitely have a deeper sounding bass let me try these on one more time yes you know the bass is like that that the extra part of the base the the tail end of the base these have a little bit more bass so for the gym I would definitely recommend the beachfit pros now we know the airpod pros are going to have better noise cancellation the noise cancellation on these is is pretty good but it's definitely not top of the top tier like these but for the gym these have a better fit and more bass in terms of volume pretty much the same okay now before I show y'all my top 10 I hope y'all appreciate this video because I just did some of the most thorough tests that I did in a long time I shout out the shoes for keeping me company here's my top 10 truly wireless earbuds as of September 2022. number one on my list has not changed okay the bno ex now I don't care what nobody says these are my favorite truly wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation these are a little bit pricey but worth every penny I love these I I literally love these let's zoom out a little that's number one number two on my list banging all of sudden the eqs okay so we got the ex and the EQ these are the two best truly wireless earbuds that I own that's number two number three on my list we're going with the new Sennheiser momentums okay these are number three now I'm not going to give y'all a whole Soliloquy all right hashtag big words alert about each set of earbuds I'm just gonna rank them that's number three number four on my list the bowels and Wilkins pi7s the only thing about these is the battery life is not that great but the sound quality is gonna blow you away that's number four number five one of the most underrated set of earbuds the dvla uh Gemini's now when I first got these the software all right the software was so trash but they did a bunch of updates and y'all know they sent me a new pair because I had an issue with mines they stopped charging the company sent me a new pair these are number five on my list okay the sound quality active noise cancellation but the sound quality all right that's number five look at shoes number six on my list the techniques all right the new techniques these is amazing okay the old techniques was amazing but these are just as amazing these are number six number seven master and Dynamics mw08s now I do got the mw08 sports also with the carbon fiber case same sound though I same sound same A and C okay so that's uh seven number eight okay so now we got some movement number eight I'm going with the new Bose quiet Comforts I had the quiet Comfort twos they really upgrade the sound quality on these and the god tier god tier noise cancellation number nine speaking of God tear noise cancellation the Sony all right the Sony the m4s all right these are the newer versions god tier noise cancellation now to all these earbuds that you see on the table these have the most ANC but Bose is number one now number 10 on my list this is where it gets interesting you would think it would be the Galaxy Bud Pro 2 or the airpod pro 2s no neither one of these made my list now this is why I did the thorough testing off camera I put both of these uh just for fun I put these against each other these ones I had to cancel these out now my number chain list on the list is the clips T5 to ancs so I put these up against the airpod pro 2s and these have more bass I the sound quality is just better it's just better spatial audio is amazing on the airpod Pro 2 the connectivity everything is great everything is great okay but look man somebody can't make it and if I had to choose between the airpod pro 2s and the clip t52s I like bass now you might like Mahatma Gandhi's greatest hits you know I'm saying you might be um into Beethoven and Mozart or Cyndi Lauper you know whatever depending on what kind of music you like you might value the spatial audio and the lossless audio from the iPhones a little bit more but me I'm into mob deep all right I'm into Tupac I'm into Biggie Smalls I'm into music with a lot of bass these have more bass so these are more towards my lifestyle so these are number 10. you should be number 11 and number 12. okay then after that everything else let me say this now when I rank my top ten depending on what Channel you watch I don't know who your favorite uh Tech Reviewer is I take reviewer me I'm just a regular guy so my opinion you got to take it with a grain of salt I there's no right or wrong answer everybody gonna have different opinion everybody's ears sound different every time I do one of these headphone videos or these earbud videos I read the comment and somebody says oh I got these you was right they definitely sound crazy and there's always one person that says oh I got these and I gotta disagree with you I didn't like them that much it's everybody's gonna have different tastes different ears different sounds you know there's no right or wrong answer so this is just my personal opinion but as you can see by all of the earbuds on the table I am an air biologist I have a PhD in ear biology from the state of New York City New York State somebody somebody roasted me I said it's the city of New York State University I the city of New York state university has certified me in air biology so you could you can understand that I do hear a lot of different earbuds so these are my rankings anyway let's go ahead and wrap this up airpod Pro 2s on a scale of one to ten I'm giving these a major major major go like I said if you have you into the Apple ecosystem you're gonna love the sound quality it's a real upgrade crispy highs and mids these could use a little bit more bass the bass could be deeper richer and Fuller they they need to have an uh EQ these need to have a separate airpods app where you could customize the EQ settings all right if they would have had that that could have made it better because these need a little bit more bass but if you're not really heavy into bass you're not going to care about that these are going to sound amazing gonna have excellent battery life excellent call Quality you're gonna be able to connect from your Apple watch to your MacBook to your iPad to it changing your iPhone or the Apple devices is going to connect seamlessly not to mention you're gonna look trendy as [ __ ] all right you get set of these you go to Starbucks okay you pull out your suede your suede t-shirt all right with your penny loafers okay and your mock neck you're gonna be doing it big okay everybody knows these are the trendiest earbuds on the market even if you don't really care about sound quality like Amaya I might don't care about sound quality you know how many sets of earbuds I'm like I got these dvla Geminis these will blow your ways you might get the [ __ ] out of here I don't want those I want the airpod pros why yeah because these are the trendiest earbuds out okay so if you look at these these got the floss Factor the flex Factor whatever you want to call it anyway airpod Pro 2's triple Major gold white shoes approved hit me up in the

47,T9Or2KaEaqc,Sony LinkBuds S Review - 6 Months Later,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9Or2KaEaqc,6 Months Later," The Sony Linkbuds S are a set of earbuds  that initially I wasn’t very impressed with,   but the more I used them over the past 6  months, the more I came to really like them,   and I think they’re actually a bit better than  the Sony WF-1000XM4s, which have been my earbuds   of choice over the past year. The Linkbuds S  really hit a sweet spot in terms of features,   quality, and of course, price, making  them a pretty easy pair of earbuds to   recommend. And the first thing I like  about them is their noise cancellation. Now while it's not as good as the more  expensive WF-1000XM4s that we've reviewed,   the Linkbuds S noise cancellation  is still one of the best noise   cancelation experiences I've had on  a set of earbuds in this price range. I recently took them with me on a plane and when  I had these in, I couldn't tell the difference   with their noise cancellation between the higher  price Sony XM4s. Now in other situations, yeah,   I can tell a difference between the two earbuds  like if music is playing in my room, then i do   think the XM4s noise cancellation is still a bit  better than the LinkBuds S. The LinkBuds S come   with multiple silicon tips that are very  similar to the ones found on other earbuds   like the Pixel Buds Pro and Bose Quiet Comfort  IIs, compared to the foam tips with the XM4s,   which may be part of why the XM4s perform a bit  better with noise cancellation. The rubber tips   help the LinkBuds S stay in your ear and they  also help the noise cancellation work better. The Sony Linkbuds S also seem to  have a spatial vent or some other   design feature that eliminates the  plugged ear feeling you’d get with   a lot of the early in-ear wireless earbuds  a few years ago like the Sony WF-1000XM3s. Another thing I've come to love about  the Linkbuds S is their comfort. They   are extremely comfortable, which is a phrase I'm  not exactly used to saying about a pair of in-ear   earbuds. It may just be their best feature.  Their design is much smaller than the XM4s,   40% smaller to be precise, and I’ve found  I can wear them for hours with their 4.8g   of weight. I’ve tried other earbuds  like the AirPods Pro or Beats Fit   Pro and they hurt my ears just after 20  min of wearing them, and even the XM4s,   after wearing them for about an hour and a  half or so, my ears will start to feel sore. With the LinkBuds S I have no ear soreness,  they don't fall out of my ears, and overall,   they're the most comfortable set  of in-ear earbuds I've ever worn. Another thing that's great about the  Linkbuds S is their connection. It’s   been consistently stable for me when  listening on my Mac, Pixel, iPhone   etc. And via an over-the-air software update, they  support multi-point audio, which allows you to   play audio and sounds from more than one connected  device at a time, and best of all, on Android,   you can enable multi-point audio while still  keeping LDAC enabled, which is a higher quality   codec the Linkbuds S support for listening  to higher quality music, which is awesome. Another thing I've enjoyed with the LinkBuds  S is their mic quality and transparency mode.   Here's how their mics sound. And these  are how the Sony LinkBuds S mics sound,   let me know in the comments…how do you think  they sound? For their transparency mode,   while nothing compares to the  transparency mode on my AirPods Max,   Overall I think the LinkBuds S has one of the  best transparency modes i've experienced on a   set of earbuds and compared to the  WF-1000XM4s, i think the LinkBuds S   transparency mode is actually a little bit  better, thanks to their better onboard mics. And their battery life is pretty  decent for their size and weight,   6 hours battery life and 14 hours remaining in  the case and you’ll get a notification from the   Sony headphones app when the headphones  case battery level dips below 30%. To charge the Linkbuds S case, you’ll  need a USB-C chord as they don’t come   with wireless charging and speaking of the  case, when I first bought the Linkbuds S,   their case felt very rough, almost rugged  and not very smooth, which felt a bit weird,   but over the past 6 months, the case material  has smoothed out a bit and feels a lot better. Also, kudos to Sony for being one of  those companies embracing plastic-free   packaging. I wish more companies  would get on board and do this. The last thing I like about these buds is  actually the Sony Headphones app. This app,   while it has some odd quirks and features, is  overall a highlight to these buds and Sony has   made some welcome improvements to it. It has  useful features like being able to set the   ambient sound allowed in for transparency mode. If  you want to tweak the sound profile of your buds,   Sony included an EQ feature, though for  these buds, I actually think they sound   pretty good out of the box, so I haven’t  toyed with the EQ feature all that much,   and if you want to improve sound quality, the  app is of course where you can prioritize sound   quality for their bluetooth connection and  turn on DSEE, which is Sony’s proprietary   technology for upscaling low-quality music  so you’ll hear more clarity and detail,   though if you’re already listening to most  modern music through an iPhone or Android   and a music-streaming app, I haven’t noticed  a huge difference with this feature turned on. The other thing Sony added in the app I really  like is on the status page you can monitor the   decibel level you’re listening at with your  headphones, which is really useful if you   don’t want to listen to your music at unsafe  levels that can permanently damage your hearing. The app also includes some features that  work well. I've just preferred to leave   off while testing these buds like adaptive  sound control, where the app will detect   your actions like walking or sitting and  adjust the noise cancellation automatically,   I found this feature with this product and past  Sony products to be just more annoying than   helpful. the same thing with speak to chat, which  is my limited testing, works well by pausing your   music and turning on transparency mode when  the earbuds detect your talking to someone,   but I prefer just to have manual control  over when music stops and then resumes again. The app does have some odd quirks though like a  badge system to reward you for using the product,   which is just dumb, and an entire services tab  for extra stuff you can do with the LinkBuds   S and apps they’ll work with, but other than  Spotify, I’m not sure how useful the rest are. The last thing I like about the LinkBuds S is  their sound quality. For a pair of your buds   in this price range, their sound quality is  pretty good. Now, if you're buying these,   expecting them to sound just as good as the  WF-1000XM4s, unfortunately, you're going to be   a bit disappointed. Sony used different drivers  for these buds than the XM4s, and as a result,   I’ve found the Linkbuds S sound doesn’t quite  match the XM4s. The XM4s sound a bit more full,   where the LinkBuds S, they still sound very  clean, but you'll notice less separation in   certain tracks. So that's everything I've liked  about the LinkBuds S for the past six months of   using them. Now, let's talk downsides and some  things I think Sony could improve with these buds. The first thing I think Sony could  improve with these buds is wireless   charging support. They'd be almost perfect  if their case included wireless charging.   Another downside is unlike some competing  buds, the Sony Linkbuds S don’t give you   any way to control the volume of the  earbuds with tap or swipe controls,   though this won’t be as bothersome to those who  use a smartwatch with media controls like on my   Apple Watch Series 8 or Pixel Watch, Both of  which will have reviews out on soon. So make   sure you subscribe to the channel in order to  see our long-term reviews of these two watches. Sony could use their Triple and Double tap  functions on the left earbud for volume   control. Right now these actions are reserved for  a Quick Access feature that only works right now,   with Spotify Tap and Endel. Why Sony doesn't like  you customize these actions more is beyond me. Another downside I’ve encountered with the  earbuds is actually with their multipoint   connectivity. Let's say I have the LinkBuds S  connected to both my iPad and my Android phone.   I just simply hold down the right earbud  here thinking that I'm going to trigger   the Google Assistant on my phone when in  fact I just triggered Siri on the iPad. Unlike features like Apple’s iCloud switching  feature for AirPods where Apple most of the time   knows which product you’re currently using and  switches audio from that device to your AirPods,   Sony doesn't know which product you're  actively using at the current moment.   So it's very easy to trigger the  wrong assistant on the wrong device. Also it takes just a second  or two longer than I’d like to   actually trigger the Assistant  on the devices from the buds. You can also load the Google Assistant and Amazon  Assistant onto the earbuds as well, though I   typically just stick with whatever assistant  is on the device I want to play music from. The last downside I've encountered  with these buds is with phone   calls. When calls start on the Link Buds,  transparency/ambient sound mode will turn on,   which is okay. But let's say there's a lot  of background noise and I want to be able   to block that out and concentrate on the call  that I've picked up on my phone. On my XM4s,   I can tap the left bud to trigger more noise  cancellation to kick in but on the LinkBuds S,   I can’t seem to do this and still can hear  background noise which is slightly annoying. So that's everything I've liked and  disliked about these Sony LinkBuds S,   and overall, I think these are actually  a pretty fantastic set of earbuds. The more I’ve used them, the more I’ve liked  them, especially their fantastic comfort,   water resistance, mic quality, and sound, at  a retail price of $199 US dollars but you can   often find them on sale for between $120 and $150  dollars. I think these are a great set of in-ear   buds for both iPhone and Android users and they'll  easily pair to devices like Windows PCs and Macs. I've left purchase links in the video and  description below. If you'd like to pick up a pair   or just check their current price.

48,6N63hLQ2Rjk,This Makes No SENSE - Sony LinkBuds S,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N63hLQ2Rjk,ShortCircuit," - I'm a little confused. (box thumping) We just did a video on Sony's LinkBuds, whose claim to fame is that they've got this donut shaped hole in the middle, allowing ambient sound to pass through, giving them effectively an open-backed sound. Sony, then followed up on these with the LinkBuds S, the opposite of that. The LinkBuds S are an active noise-canceling product that do not have any kind of open-backed, sound pass through design. They just use software to allow you to hear the sound around you, just like, well, any other ANC earphones. (laughs) My questions are two then. A, Sony, why did you use the LinkBuds name to describe something so totally different. And B why should I care about... Wow. Okay. They're really light. Sony says these are the smallest and the lightest true wireless, active noise-canceling earphones. And they are astonishingly light. Here's one of our ANC mics. You can see that right there. Here's our charging contacts. Here's the proximity sensor, so it can tell if it's in your ear. They've got this cool new software feature that's kind of like a soundtrack to your life, they're supposed to know where you are and what you're doing. So, right after you get off of a call they might behave it a certain way. Or if you put them in your ears maybe they just start auto-playing music for you. Right here, that looks like our, either microphone or microphone array for voice pickup. These might actually be around the same size as the AirPods Pros. I still haven't found something to replace them day-to-day. The FP8s from LG are so close but the shape of the carrying case is just not as ideal. I mean, the LinkBuds are super cool but I do need ANC, that's a feature I care about a lot. There's just nothing that beats the pocketability of this for me. And you can see even now on the LinkBuds S, Sony's carrying case is markedly thicker, but in terms of its X and Y, it's actually about darn near the same. The thing is if the not-Apples of the world were offering substantially more battery life or features out of this extra bulk it would be a lot easier to forgive, but in general, they're not. This one is rated at 20 hours of battery life in the case, plus six from the earphones themselves, for a total of about 26, which is solid, but not groundbreaking. One thing that's really cool that I'm noticing though is they've got this kind of ribbed texture on the silicone eartips that I would think, I mean this is just intuitively speaking I don't have any empirical evidence for it, but I would think would help them stay in your ears more easily. Wow, those are... Man, like I can tell in my hand that they're small but these are really compact. I do not anticipate that there would be any challenges whatsoever, even sleeping with these in, and I could not imagine a scenario where I could get them out of my ears. They haven't budged at all, not even a little. Touch-sensitive controls on the side. So let's just figure out what all the buttons do. I'm assuming a long press is... Hey, there we go, I'm in... Oh, oh, that's the temporary feature that I screwed up on the XM5 unboxing. So that's working perfectly fine. I will say that with an in ear it's not as comfortable because you're kind of pushing it into your ear. I mean, I guess... Okay, it works a little better if you just have your whole hand against the side of your head, it's still, I'd say not as comfortable as if you had an over the ear, and I'd like to see a bit of a shorter delay on it, personally, but then I could see running into trouble where if you are just adjusting your hair or something like that, you could... What just happened? I went like this and it's like, da da da. Did I just change the mode? Now it's in transparency mode all the time? Credit to Sony, they've done an excellent job of the transparency mode on this at least as far as my own voice is concerned, I haven't really heard you guys talk much yet but... - [Jono] You look pretty good. - [Andy] Hello. - Yeah. That's extremely natural sounding. It's hard to get both right. It's hard to get the sound of the speaker right and the sound of the surroundings right. But Sony has done, to my quick ears, an excellent job of that. I never really talked about charging, the case supports wireless charging and there's also a USB-C input here. I like this. Maybe it's old fashioned but just gimme a fricking pairing button. I don't want to have to remember a special dance for every stupid device in my life. Just put a pairing button on things, you hold the button, they go in a pairing mode, there. I'm over it. I do like the whole magical pairing experience thing but as a backup, I just want that hardware button. See? Even Apple still does it.

It really does sound like the audio's coming from here and you're in this space where it's reflecting off all the walls and everything. But if you pre-record it getting that kind of imaging into a stereo source is kind of trivial. So I don't know if they've actually processed this from that same original file or if they're just kind of cheating. Wow. I normally try to evaluate this much earlier in the process for an active noise-canceling headphone, but never mind the just general hums of the studio which are completely gone, I could barely hear you guys talking from like, I don't know, six, seven feet away? - [Andy] Hi, Linus. How are you doing today? - That's really good and I didn't even stop to think that the active noise-canceling was on because it doesn't have any kind of pressure feeling, there's nothing unpleasant about having it activated. Available operations on the left unit. Okay. Noise-canceling, ambient sound. Hello. Wow, you've kind of really got a mash on it though, which to be clear is probably a good thing 'cause you don't wanna be laying on a pillow or just brushing against it and having it activate. So I get it. I will say that compared to a more rounded shape here, this flatter shape, right along the back here, is not as comfortable for me. So when I press, if I were to press on this in my ear it has more to brace on in the outer part of my ear. Whereas with this one, when I press on it to activate something, I am jamming that thing further into my ear. - [Andy] Linus? Could you lean back a tiny bit? - Sorry? - [Andy] Could you lean back a tiny bit? - Oh yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Just... (crew laughing) - [Andy] The noise-canceling works. - By default, the right side has functions already bound, tap, double tap, triple tap. I wish the double and triple tap registered a little faster. It's amazing what a difference good active noise-canceling makes to how loud you feel like you have to turn up your music. There's a strong argument to be made for just springing for ANC just to make sure you're not turning up your music so loud that you're gonna damage your ears. Different EQ presets are here. (upbeat music) Honestly, these have a more balanced sound right outta the box than the XM5s did. Hmm, that's annoying. That's the thing about touch controls, man. I do like the stem squeeze on the AirPods Pros. Touch, anytime you go to adjust them you're liable to (train horn blaring) control something. - [Andy] Did you hear the train? - Oh. I don't even have an active noise-canceling on right now. I'm just in passive mode. - [Jono] Oh, what? - Yeah, no, it's just off right now, 'cause they isolate noise well. That's why I thought the branding was so confusing, 'cause the regular LinkBuds are all about letting ambient noise through. Well, let's turn on the noise-canceling. Like is it doing things? Yeah, I have no awareness of that whatsoever. - [Jono] Ooh, that's dangerous. - We are going to be finalizing which head and torso we're gonna be using for audio reviews on LTT moving forward, probably today, I think we're actually sending back the other one tomorrow. So we can get you guys real numbers, but I would bet at least lunch with our new audio guy that these have extremely strong ANC. To my ear they also sound excellent right outta the box as well. I'm liking them. At $199, yeah, you got my attention Sony. Killer. Subscribe.

49,3MZ3iLZjtMI,"Sony LinkBuds S review: Small Earbuds, Big Sound",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZ3iLZjtMI,CNET, hey folks so not too long ago sony released its donut-shaped link buds with an open design that's certainly unique looking now it's back with these guys the link butts s a more traditional set of noise isolating and yes noise canceling earbuds that have a pretty premium 200 price tag but sit below sony's flagship wf-1000x mark 4 buds they're really appealing a lot of ways but are they the best for the money let's talk about that [Music] now some of you are probably wondering what the s in link buzz s stands for i don't think it exactly stands for one thing or at least that's what sony rep told me it seems to stand for a bunch of s words like smartness and sound quality and silence and a seamless connection to your online and offline worlds which in sony speak means they're designed to be worn all the time they're basically the sony equivalent of the airpods pro and the first thing you notice about them is that they're really lightweight and smaller than the wf-1000x mark 4 bus in fact sony's calling them the smallest and lightest noise-cancelling high-res true wireless earbuds because they do support sony's so-called near-lossless lvdeck audio codec for bluetooth streaming but more on that in a minute let me go through some of the other key design highlights first [Music] like the standard length buds these are made out of recycled plastic or at least partially so and come in two color options of black and white it's interesting to note that the black version has more of a textured finish while the white one has a completely smooth finish i don't know if that means that the black version has more recycled plastic in it but the two cases are exactly the same size and they're nice and compact just slightly bigger than the airpods pro's case but unlike the wf-1000x mark force case it doesn't have wireless charging just usbc charging a lot of the buzz in this price range do have wireless charging the earbuds fit my ears really well and they are quite comfortable they also don't stick out of your ears too far they sit fairly flush and should fit a variety of ear types even small ears and on another positive note i was able to get a tight seal with the included ear tips which wasn't exactly the case for me with the wf 1000 x mark 4 buds as i've said many times that tight seal is crucial for both optimal sound quality and optimal noise cancelling these use sony's v1 chip not its qn1 chip and they just don't have the same components not the same drivers on the same microphone so you're not going to get quite the same sound quality noise cancellation as you get with the wf-1000x mark iv but both the sound and noise cancelling are really solid overall and while the noise canceling is a slight step behind the wf-1000x4s it's not a big step there's also an ambient mode with adjustable levels that allow you to tweak how much sound you want to let in from the outside world it may not be quite as good as what apple offers with its transparency mode in terms of how natural things sound but it does sound pretty natural so long as you don't crank it up to the highest level these have sony's quick attention mode that allows you to tap and hold the left button to muffle the music you're listening to and enter ambient mode so you can hear what's going on around you and have a conversation there's also the speak to chat feature that's essentially hands-free quick attention if someone comes up to you and wants to chat you can simply start talking hey how you doing and your audio pauses and the earbuds go into ambient mode the audio then resumes after a short period of time anywhere from 5 seconds to 30 seconds depending on your preference or you can manually resume it by tapping on either bud i thought the touch controls worked well so no problems there and i didn't have any issues with dropouts the bluetooth 5.2 connection with my iphone 13 pro and a couple of android phones was rock solid they have an ipx4 splash proof rating so you can use them for sporting activities and they stayed in my ears securely even though they don't have any sport fins i had no trouble running with them and use them for a few days at the gym battery life is rated at six hours with an extra 14 hours in the charging case that may not be great but it's not bad considering the compact size of the buds and by comparison the standard link buds offer 5.5 hours of battery life and those don't have active noise cancelling sony throws in several extra features including an adaptive sound control mode that'll adjust the sound and noise cancelling on the fly based on your environment plenty of eq settings in the app to tweak the sound of it if you want naturally these have support for sony's 360 audio virtual surround music format select few music services that offer 360 audio tracks and sony's also introducing some new features like autoplay that automatically launches a custom spotify playlist based on your activity and finally there are new partnerships with endl and microsoft soundscape in the services section of the app i find all that stuff a little gimmicky but you can have fun checking it all out as i said the link buds s sound quite good with nicely detailed sound the trouble's got some sparkle to it and the bass is well defined it has plenty of punch they have a relatively open exciting sound and are slightly more forward sounding than the wf-1000x mark iv which offer a bit more depth and slightly richer sound quality overall however for their size and weight you'll be hard-pressed to find a better sounding set of buds and if you have an android device or dedicated music player that supports ldac bluetooth streaming you can get a touch better sound when streaming with a music service like full buzz or title that offers high resolution tracks okay before i get into some final comparisons let's talk about voice quality for calls because that's become an important feature for a lot of people sony says these have special mesh covered microphones that are supposed to help with reducing wind noise and you've got some new ai some software algorithms to help reduce background noise in general all right so now i got a lot of traffic in the background dog barking back there so i'm talking again just some people get a sense of how my voice sounds as there's a lot of background noise again any extra thoughts mostly the same problem uh i i really don't hear too much background noise at all but uh the problem is maybe it's overcompensating because of that background noise but your actual voice quality just is not great okay so for narcase it looks like the regular link buzz are better for calls and the sony wh 1000 x mark 5 are definitely a step up for a call so there you have it that's our test call for the link buds s thanks for listening john so i had high expectations for voice calling and while i think the link buttons felt a little short in terms of how clearly you could hear my voice with a lot of background noise they do a really good job reducing that background noise by contrast the standard link buds didn't do quite as good a job reducing background noise but people said they could hear my voice more clearly so it'll be interesting to see whether we get a firmware upgrade that tweaks the voice calling ai sony typically does deliver firmware upgrades every few months like i said at the beginning the link bus s are really appealing a lot of ways they're lightweight and compacted don't skimp on the features and performance they're kind of a cross between sony's 100 c 500 buds and the wf 1000 x mark 4 buds i think they sound fuller and better than jobbers elite 7 pro which costs around the same price they're also pretty lightweight and compact it's a tougher call when you compare them to the 200 beats fit pro the beats sound really good and for apple users anyway they have some extra features like spatial audio and always on siri and automatic pairing with all the apple devices in your icloud account alas like the standard link buds these link bus s do not have multi-point bluetooth pairing that would allow you to pair them to two devices simultaneously like a computer and a smartphone these fit pro aren't as discreet looking as these sonys but they do have integrated sport fins that really lock the buzz in your ears some people like that some people don't i do think that if especially you're an android user who can take advantage of the ldac support the link butts as have enough appealing trades to make you consider dropping 200 on them they are the sony buds for people who don't want larger buds like the wf1000x4 but want 80 to 85 percent of their features and performance for 80 less that said i do think there'll be an easier sell once they get discounted a bit because to me anyway they feel more like 150 earbuds than 200 earbuds yeah you can probably say the same thing about the beats fit pro but that's what my gut says so i gotta say it but let me what you guys think what do you think of the design and are these the sony buds you've been waiting for sound off in the comments section if you're interested in any of the products mentioned check out the description below for links on where to find them and you can get even more details in my text review on cnet lastly if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david cronin for cnet thanks for watching [Music] you,Sony Linkbuds S,The link buzz s is a more traditional set of noise isolating and noise canceling earbuds.They have a pretty premium 200 price tag but sit below the flagship wf-1000x mark 4 buds.The black version has more of a textured finish while the white one has a completely smooth finish.The two cases are exactly the same size and they're nice and compact just slightly bigger than the airpods pro's case. The link buds s sound quite good with nicely detailed sound the trouble's got some sparkle to it.The bass is well defined it has plenty of punch and are slightly more forward sounding than the wf-1000x mark.For their size and weight you'll be hard-pressed to find a better sounding set of buds.
50,DAm4jcrLC8U,THE DEFINITIVE Sony LINKBUDS S Review &amp; Comparison by an AUDIO ENGINEER,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAm4jcrLC8U,This is Tech Today, this video is a definitive and experiential review of the sony link buds s and in comparison with their sony wf-1000xm4s the apple airpods pro and the samsung galaxy buds pro all from the perspective of an audio engineer because of that i bring over 15 years of audio engineer experience and equipment to give you an immersive and experiential review where you'll be able to hear the comparative differences between all these earbuds we'll do that by listening to a variety of different styles of music as well as examples of noise cancellation transparency microphones and more if you've ever watched my headphone reviews and comparisons like the one i did on the sony wh-1000xm5 you know that i often use these two thousand dollar ears to get high quality recordings of headphones well the ears were quite great for headphones but they weren't quite cutting it for me for earbuds so i constructed this three thousand 000 rig with high quality expensive microphones my goodness but they cover the entire human hair range that means you can better hear how each earbud sounds and performs for this video you'll want to make sure that you're wearing headphones or earbuds in both ears in order to have the best experience for this video so go ahead pause and make sure you put them on now before we continue okay let's discover what an experiential and immersive review is by listening to this first track you'll see which earbud you're listening to by looking at the label up top this track is filled with a lot listen to the sub frequencies the high end from the snare and hi-hat type sounds and the mid-range from the sim [Music] just in fyi you'll be able to see what the genre is of each song and find your way around this video easily because i have chapters enabled in the description alongside links to purchase anything mentioned in this video sitting a step above the 179 donut-shaped sony link buds a step below the 279 dollar sony wf-1000 xm4s the 200 sony link butts s are technically the smallest anc enabled earbuds out on the market when i initially saw their ladybug looking design i thought well that's way smaller than the huge sony earbud design that we usually see from them it also made me think of the google pixel buds a series which have been the most comfortable pair of earbuds i've personally used that also feel secure and you know what they do actually feel extremely comfortable but with a bit more of an ear tip snugness to it that's not bad unfortunately though it's just thick enough for me at least that i can't rest my head on a pillow without feeling a little bit uncomfortable unlike what happens on the pixel buds a series which i just don't feel outside of that both the earbuds and the case have a kind of grippy texture and feel to it that's closer to but not quite sandpaper-like compared to something soft touch like on the xm4s or galaxy butts pro or the fingerprint prone slimy gloss of the airpods pro case unfortunately it lacks wireless charging which all the other cases have which is especially disappointing when it's so common and at a list price of 200. the case is a little bit bigger than the airpods pro case and the galaxy buds pro case but definitely much smaller than the xm4 case alright let's listen to this next sample in this one listen to the low end the reverb from the vocals and the snare and the sharpness of the hi-hat and this is really important especially for this comparison listen to the stereo spread from the wawa sounds and let me know what you notice in the comments [Music] me [Music] the xm4s feel massive in comparison to all the other earbuds but it does have a design that will still work with more ears compared to the galaxy butts pro which has a stem that i've heard is just too big for those with smaller ear canals the airpods pro are fascinatingly unassuming in the sense that you don't really feel that much so they're extremely comfortable but they also make you worry about them falling out of your ears i will say that the airpods pro do manage to stay in your ears well but the sony xm4s and the leak buds s definitely feel the most premium secure and like they won't fall out the galaxy buds pro though feel the least secure to me especially when i'm working out and feeling a little bit sweaty at the end of the day no ears the same so it's best to try them out for yourself speaking of sweat all these have the bare minimum ipx4 water resistance rating with the exception of the galaxy buzz pro which has an ipx7 rating and i just wish all earbuds had at least an ipx7 rating just like in case it rains or you're that person that likes to keep your earbuds in when you take a shower so i mean like no judgment for me if that's you okay for this track it's a very mid-rangey warm and soulful track listen to her vocals the electric guitar lines and keyboard [Music] [Applause] [Music] interactions on the link buds s are quite similar to all the other earbuds in the sense that you can just tap or squeeze if you're on the airpods pro it'll go between play and pause move between tracks and go between transparency mode or anc mode on everything but the airpods pro you also have the ability to change your settings so that you can adjust your volume up or down with a touch gesture the downside of that is whenever you change it to volume up or down you lose something else like being able to go forward or backwards in your tracks much like the airpods pro case you also get a physical button which is really nice so you can easily go into pairing mode instead following around trying to figure out how to go into pairing mode with whatever random method for the xm4 the galaxy buds pro they also support quick pair abilities like android quick pair or for the airpods pro you have their own quick pair feature for ios unlike all the others the link buds s do not independently connect to your device so you must use a right earbud in order to use the left earbud this is just tragic news for those who like to wear one earbud at a time it's one of the big reasons why i don't use my favorite sounding earbuds the akg n400s more often again this is really painful for a 200 set of earbuds on the link buds s you can by default hold down on the left earbud to temporarily go into transparency mode which is really helpful if you need to talk to someone real quick or use their speak to chat feature as a whole sony has told me that they wanted to make these a lot like the open earbud link buds but they do this through the transparency mode instead of a donut hole design we'll explore how well they pull off transparency later for this song pay attention to the clarity of the attack of the acoustic guitar strings but how four the mid-range is in the body of the guitar and especially the vocals pay attention to whether the vocals feel like they're forward or if they're buried in the mix when the nights get cold sometimes when i look over i see you by a fire with your hands out in the open and i wonder if you're singing an autumn song [Music] but if i'm singing all [Music] active noise cancellation or anc feels a bit like a buzzword within the headphone and earbud industry and not all of them are actually all that great and don't do much other than somewhat lower the volume of what's happening around you that's to say that they're not doing really all that much that's better than passively plugging your ear with something sony on the other hand has quite the reputation for having fantastic noise cancellation at least with the 1000xm lineup so the question is do the link buds s live up to their reputation well let's listen for ourselves and find out how it stacks up against the competition with some white noise i've even included some frequency graphs so you can see how each earbud handles a anc who do you think did it best let me know in the comments i think it's really interesting to see how each of the earbuds prioritize different frequencies or ranges for a noise cancellation and i think it's clear that the xm4s and airpods pro cancel out the most but the xm4s are the only ones that didn't struggle with cancelling out the 5k to 10k frequency range and in turn whatever it lets through sounds pretty natural but mid-range focused but let's see how they deal with cancelling out deep sub frequencies and lows [Music] again the xm4s and airpods pro do the best and they're pretty close but different in how they do it i will say that the link buds s do let a bit through but whatever blades through manages to sound pretty natural just like the xm4s the galaxy buds pro did have a lot of that cabin pressure on the ears when trying to cancel out the low end so keep that in mind if your ears are sensitive to that like mine but which one do you think did it better and how do you feel the link buds s did for all the anc tests for this song it has a lot of great reverb going on listen to how forward the vocals sound and if you can hear much of the percussive instruments in the background or if they sound really buried this is where the mid-range can really bring out some instruments the bass guitar is also one of my favorite parts of this song [Music] [Music] my [Music] now sony told me that these are a continuation in the thought process of the donut-shaped link buds which sought to have an open back design to make it so you can clearly hear your surroundings and not feel closed up so they design these they have a good transparency mode with speak to chat features that can automatically move between a anc and transparency mode just by talking so does it do it well well let's hear some samples to find out this is what the ambient sound sounds like on the sony link buds s now you have the option to focus on the voice so we'll tap on that and this is what it sounds like when i'm focusing on the voice we can uncheck that and there's even a granular option to adjust the ambient sound and this is it all the way to max at maximum transparency how does it sound now this is what it would sound like if you were in transparency mode using the apple air pods pro and you were just hearing me talk to you and he even has a little bit of a stereo effect to it which is kind of interesting and much like the sony link buds s the sony wf-1000xm4s also have an ambient mode that is quite stereo like it also has the ability to focus on the voice so now let's focus on the voice how does it sound like is it any better we can turn that off and we can adjust the ambient sound down to one all the way back up to 20 so the maximum transparency how does it sound and this is what the samsung galaxy buds pro would sound like if i was in a transparency mode it also has a bit more of that stereo effect there's also a setting where you can emphasize your voice so let's turn that on and see what it sounds like so now we have voice detect on does that sound any better if i were to talk to you and you were wearing the samsung galaxy buds pro it's important to know that all these earbuds with the exception of the airpods pro have a kind of a speak to chat feature where it automatically moves between the anc and transparency mode i do notice that both the sonys are quite reliable fast and clean with the xm4 having an ever so pleasant time when it activates the app even has the ability to control how long it stays open so you can have it open for a short period of time or longer whatever your preference is unfortunately i haven't been able to find a way to record this speak the chat feature but the transparency would be the same as what we just heard but automatically activated but here's something that's interesting you can actually tell how natural the transparency is by listening to a song through the earbuds so let's see how it sounds [Music] don't get me wrong i'm ready [Music] videos like this require over 40 hours of work and requires thousands and thousands of dollars of equipment so if you want to say thanks we have super things enabled on the channel that allows you to click on it and simply make a donation and your comment will stand out really clearly so i can thank you thanks to all of you who support me through that by clicking the links in the description and checking out our video's sponsors this is a track from my personal friend hannah perry listen to how dynamic the track sounds and if you can hear all the layers from the horns to the very strings and the melodic percussion instruments [Music] [Applause] [Music] now let's test out the microphones and the call quality experience we'll actually throw in the normal link buds as well for mic samples since these have some really great reviews for the mic and to help financially support videos like these while providing you the value you're looking for while saving you time i'll test out the mics while telling you about masterworks if you're like me and you're feeling not only the pain of inflation but the pain that comes from looking at your stock portfolio and seeing the red of stocks constantly falling more and more every day you're probably wondering where you can even put money where it doesn't lose value to inflation and has a history of past performance what's crazy is that masterworks talked to me a couple months ago and gave me this article from jv morgan that said that traditional investing in stocks and bonds over the next few years would be quite poor and i thought that was crazy and yeah here we are they were right and it doesn't feel like it's getting any better so what's the solution well jp morgan said it's essential for investors to embrace alternative investments going forward something like contemporary blue chip art which has outperformed the s p 500 by 164 for the past 26 years and is known to perform better during periods of inflation masterworks democratizes the ability to make investments in art from artists like banksy andy warhol and keith herring so it's not just for rich billionaires who have been doing this for years but for you and me they sold three paintings since 2017 each returning over 30 internal rate of return to investors you can even buy and sell on their secondary market if you want so get diversified and sign up for masterworks there's currently a waitlist to sign up but with my code you can skip the waitlist and start investing today thanks to masterworks for sponsoring this portion of the video now that's great and all they have a mic test in a quiet room but let's make it challenging now here's what the link buttons the donuts uh how they would sound like if you were in a busy cityscape environment that's about 80 to 85 decibels i can really hear everything around it that's pretty well but how old are you and this is what the sony length buds s would sound like if you were making a video call or phone call and you were in a variant of the cityscape area at about 80 to 85 decimals and here is what the sony wf-1000xm4s would sound like before we get a phone call or video call and you're listening to me and i'm in a busy cityscape at about 80 decibels to 85.00 and this is what the microphone would sound like if you're talking over the samsung galaxy but pro and there happens to be a whole bunch of stuff going on around a cityscape at 80 decibels 85 minutes and this is what the apple airpods pro would sound like if you're making a call or talking amongst a very busy city soundscape at around 80 decibels to 85 i gotta say both the link buds models have some really phenomenal microphones especially in busy and noisy environments but what do you think this is what it would sound like if you were to receive a phone call and you're using and wearing the sony link buds s this is what it would sound like if you're to receive a phone call and you're wearing the sony wf-1000xm4s and yes all of these are over an hd phone call this is what it would sound like if you're to receive a phone call and you're wearing the samsung galaxy bots pro and this is what would sound like if you were to receive a phone call and you're wearing the apple airpods pro on an iphone for this track listen to how clear the bass guitar is on the track as well as the electric guitar and how bright the symbols are in this track [Music] you know you're doing something to me [Music] [Applause] now if you watch my review of the sony wh-1000xm5s you know that in that bluetooth distance test i tested out distance outside and they're all pretty much the same with the exception of the xm4s which got a little bit further away but in the comments for that video someone wanted me to see how far i would go inside of an office or house with doors and hallways well i tried all these earbuds in my house ran across it down the hallway and into my room and really all of them died off right before i reached my room with the exception of the airpods pro and sony wf-1000xm4s which maybe had maybe a meter more of distance that means that they're pretty much all the same so i wouldn't base your buying decision based upon bluetooth distance what may be of interest to you though is that all these earbuds with the exception of the airpods pro support ldac on an android device this is a high quality codec and it's something to consider if you can actually hear that quality difference in as a whole i think they're all pretty much awash for bluetooth now for this track it's a really awesome one that is kind of like a rock and roll one but like kind of more dramatic and cinematic pay attention to the sub frequencies for how tight it sounds and then the mid-range in the hand to see how clear it is and how wide the sound stage feels [Music] [Music] is [Music] for gaming it's generally pretty ugly for any sort of bluetooth device but you know let's look at all of them real quick to make sure reloading [Music] we're already off to a bad start but the samsung galaxy pro does have a setting to turn on low latency gaming mode if you're on a samsung device and it does get better but the real star of the show is the apple airpods pro that has fantastic low latency on the iphone i guess if you need to use earbuds for gaming use the airpods on an ios device which is really ironic since gaming in apple isn't really much of a thing unless you're on a mobile device anyways this track is an arena stopper that has some percussive low end and some broad frequency ranges covering the high mids and highs that will surely make the high-end differences between each of these earbuds really obvious [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Applause] now you're probably thinking brandon which one should i buy and it really depends on the variety of factors but you can be sure that whatever you end up buying it really helps support the channel if you click the links in the description when you do the best way to help you determine which to purchase is by considering the following different points if you care a lot about comfort then consider the airpods pro or sony link butts s via small ear canals do not get the samsung galaxy buds pro if you're deep in the apple ecosystem and like having something that easily moves between devices consider the airpods pro if you'd like to wear one earbud at a time choose anything but the sony link buds s if you want fantastic microphones consider the link buds s if you want the best transparency mode go with the apple airpods pro or the sony link buds s if you want the best anc go with the sony wf-1000xm4s or the apple airpods pro for second place if you want the best water resistance go with the samsung galaxy buds pro if you want wireless charging choose anything but the sony link buttons if you want the best sound quality well i personally go with the samsung galaxy buds pro or the sony wf-1000xm4 now you've probably noticed that i haven't told you too many of my preferences throughout this video because well i just want to present some samples to you as objectively as possible and then have you make your own decisions that's because a lot of things regarding sound can be a personal preference and the things that you may prioritize may not be the things i don't prioritize as much so i prefer giving you the points to consider to make the decision that's right fit for you rather than forcing my preferences on you now if you want to know my preferences i'll tell you right after we listen to the song this song has a killer bass line to it pay attention to that the synth and the vocal reverb [Music] if [Music] now as for my preferences i gotta say this is actually really hard all the points that matter to me are spread out kind of evenly amongst all the different earbuds so maybe it's better for me to go down the list of what would eliminate each model for me first and then make my way down the lineup so the first earbud that i would eliminate is the airpods pro while they're comfortable and have great anc i'm not a big fan of their sound i actually hate how it automatically switches between different devices often when i don't want it to and it's really only great if you're on an apple device and i switch around a lot so having a platform agnostic option makes sense for me at least personally the next one i would eliminate is the sony link buds s the sound isn't anything particularly exciting for me it leaves a lot to be desired and it's really hard to eq well to get a sound that i like which explains why i haven't provided a custom eq for this video couldn't get one that i felt i was happy with and wanted to put out there and while i absolutely love its small comfortable design and outstanding microphones i simply cannot use a pair of earbuds that cannot allow me to use one earbud at a time whether it's the right or left earbud i know its transparency mode is great but sometimes you don't want something in your ear all the time or you like to extend the battery life for things like podcasts i guess no one can say that i give sony positive reviews just because they send something to me for free the next one i would eliminate is the sony wf-1000xm4s while these have some really good sound they have a very narrow sound stage that does make it feel closed off for me and i just have a hard time getting around that if i was to go traveling though i just might take these with me to take advantage of their insanely good anc but i'd also second guess it because they're pretty big and the least comfortable of the bunch and that leaves me with the samsung galaxy buds pro they have a sound quality and sound stage that i continually come back to and absolutely love and on the default eq setting at that it's really hard for me not to prioritize sound the most and it's not because i'm an audio engineer it's because that's what i use them for the most to listen to things everything else comes after it but i do wish i had the anc of the xm4s the mics of the link buds s and the transparency of the airpods pro but hey you can't always get what you want but if you want to get what you need make sure to get it with the links in the description so what do you think about this immersive and experiential review let me know your thoughts and what you'd like to see in future reviews like this and how i can improve them let me know which earbuds you prefer and make sure to purchase them by clicking the links in the description or right here also go check out these other videos of mine about audio especially the one on the sony wh-1000xm5 it's really awesome by the way sony did provide the sony link buds sme for this review but they did not pay me nor do they have any sale or input for this review and are seen at the same time as you thanks for watching this is tech today until next time,Sony Linkbuds S,This video is a definitive review of the wireless link buds s and in comparison with their wf-1000xm4s the apple airpods pro and the galaxy airpods pro.You'll be able to hear the comparative differences between all these earbuds we'll do that by listening to a variety of different styles of music.You'll want to make sure that you're wearing headphones or earbuds in both ears in order to have the best experience for this video. Link buds s are quite similar to all the other earbuds in the sense that you can just tap or squeeze if you're on the airpods pro.The downside of that is whenever you change it to volume up or down you lose something else like being able to go forward or backwards in your tracks.Link buds s do not independently connect to your device so you must use a right earbud in buds to use the left earbud.

51,HP-_W-wvkMs,NEW Sony Linkbuds S (Smallest &amp; Lightest ANC HiFi Earbuds),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP-_W-wvkMs,Mike O'Brien, so for quite a few years now sony's been making arguably the best premium wireless earbuds the latest being the 1000x mark iv's which are known for great features great sound quality and above all else unbeatable active noise cancellation but they have some drawbacks the first one being the massive size of them the earbuds are absolutely huge and the second one being the price they're 280 dollars which is out of reach for a lot of people but sony just came out with what they believe to be a mid-range pair but in my opinion is going to out-compete the high-end 1000x mark fours for quite a few reasons i'm going to mention throughout this video and these are the brand new sony link buds s now these earbuds are more compact they're a lot more comfortable these earbuds also have incredible active noise cancellation that is competitive with the high-end model the x-mark fours and these cost substantially less but that's not all in this video i'm going to talk a lot about what i liked and what i didn't like about the sony link buds s but before we get any further into the video i just want to point out that link buds s finally sony's coming out with a much better naming scheme than wh-1000x mark iv which honestly nobody ever remembers and so linkbuzz asks much better name for this one now we'll talk about what the link buds s had to compromise to cut the price back from the x mark iv's but one of the things that they really didn't compromise much was the active noise cancellation and this is one of my favorite features about these earbuds being that when you put them in not only are they very very powerful but they're also really clean meaning you don't have any kind of hissing you don't have any white noise and it feels like you don't have earbuds in it just feels like the room got quieter which is really the goal for earbuds and that's a goal that a lot of earbuds really miss even very powerful anc earbuds sometimes they have hissing sometimes your ears feel stuffy these really don't have that and so just for reference i mean i did a test a classic test where i play a white noise on my laptop i don't have these earbuds connected and i want to see how at what volume they're able to block out that white noise so with the sound being a jet noise the link buds s were able to block it out up to volume about 22 or 23 while the sony 1000x mark 4s were about volume 24 or 25. so you can see these were really really close in magnitude and on top of that like i said being that the link buds s are substantially lighter that gives you an advantage of feeling like you don't even have earbuds in your ears and just it blocks sound around you very passively in the background so that's a huge positive there but i mentioned that being lighter is important it has a lot of other advantages so let's talk more about the physical design as a whole now these have two different colors they have white and black and you can see the case itself is very similar to the x mark fours in many regards like it's slightly smaller but otherwise it stands upright it has usb type c on the back we also have a button on the back for pairing and this is made out of recycled plastic so it does feel slightly more like matte and maybe a little bit cheaper gives it a lighter feel to it but i mean the case is definitely going to be durable enough i don't really have any concerns with that and when we open the case up you'll see the earbuds are probably about half the size of the 1000 x mark fours which i think is a massive reduction considering they still have six hours of battery in the earbuds which is really impressive and 20 hours when you include the case now the earbuds themselves on the outside have a touch pad you can customize this sort of and i'll show you the app in a little bit later in the video but these also have a microphone on the bottom covered with a little mesh screen and i'll get into a microphone test and on the inside they have a proximity sensor so you can actually sense when they're in or out of your ears for auto playing and auto pausing and sony added a really cool new feature for the auto play and auto pause which essentially allows you to take these out and just connect to spotify and start playing automatically now we'll talk a lot more about the features and the functions within the app but these sony's really been marketing them as the smallest high-res anc earbuds which i know is really pinpointing one specific thing but i would say that's a specific thing that everybody's trying to be like you want to be the smallest because one is going to be more comfortable if they're lighter in your ears two it's going to be smaller in your pocket then and three they're going to be more secure if they weigh less they're less likely to fall out of your ears if you're working out or running or something like that which by the way these are ipx4 water resistant so working out shouldn't be a problem but the second thing there being high res of course is audio quality and you want these to sound as good as possible now resolution isn't everything and we'll dive into what these are good and what they're not good at but of course the third thing being anc earbuds really it's a really solid package for a pair of earbuds all right so this is the onboard microphone on my pixel 6 pro just to show you the ambient sound around me now let's check out the link buttons all right so this is my protest with the link buds s obviously a lot of wind going on right now a lot of traffic behind me and what i was saying before about not liking the transparency mode like i said a little bit tunnelly but i kind of realized right now one of the big issues is the wind i definitely hear that a little bit but let's see how the microphones sound if i was in a video or on a phone call like this leave a comment and let me know if you can hear what i'm saying and now for reference these are the sony wf-1000x mark fours again let me know what you think of this microphone in comparison with the link button's s uh to see which one actually sounds better and how close they really are so as you heard right there the microphone on the link buds s is honestly even better than the flagship x mark fours let's actually dive a bit deeper into that auto play feature i was talking about earlier so if we open the sony app you'll see we have four tabs status sound system and services over in services this is what i was talking about so they have spotify quick tap which is similar to what we saw in the galaxy buds and it essentially allows you to start or resume playing on spotify without ever having to take your phone out of your pocket so if you just put these in your ear and you double tap it'll start playing spotify you also have endel quick access which i've never used that service but i believe it's like soundscapes or white noise and we do also have autoplay as well which essentially is going to allow you to automatically play either music or relaxing sounds or whatever when you put the earbuds in your ear so really a cool service there and something i'm excited to see and really start using more currently it's in beta but by the time you guys actually get the earbuds hopefully they are out of beta now going through some of the other features this is where we start to get into really one of the caveats one of the things that i thought was a setback on these earbuds going back to status we have adaptive sound control which some people might really like this and this is going to allow you to change between essentially active noise cancellation or transparency like a hear through mode which the hear through mode on these is is good but it's not the best like there's many of the earbuds out there that sound a lot better and you hear their surroundings better these sound a little bit tunnelly like a little bit more synthetic and digital but regardless they're still they work and you can hear the things around you and it's a decent enough experience but not the best and that's not really the reason that i don't necessarily like this feature the main reason is because if you're wearing them and like say for example this morning i i got out of bed i put them in my ears and i was just listening to music walking around doing stuff and then you like go up to the sink and you want to brush your teeth because you're standing there they're going to all of a sudden give like a beeping sound and then switch over to like a different a different mode whether that's active noise cancellation or something like that but that i thought was a little bit annoying that it makes that beeping sound whenever you start walking or whenever you stop walking so i turned adaptive sound control off that's a feature that sounds really cool but at least for me that's it's not something that i really plan on using if we go over to sound you have some really cool things here however you have speak to chat which allows you to just start talking and it'll automatically turn your music down and kind of pause it a little bit and you can hear your surroundings so you turn a hear through mode on so if you're somebody comes over to your desk and it detects that you start speaking to them you don't have to take the earbuds out it'll just reduce your volume you can talk to somebody and then when you're done talking it'll give you maybe 15 or 30 seconds and then it'll start playing your music again we have an equalizer down here of course and the sound quality on these uh honestly they sound really good these have ldac which is going to be one of the best codecs you can get for for listening to music when you're listening to music you'll notice these are pretty warm almost to the point of being a bit dark and they lack a little bit of brilliance and sparkle but definitely there is a very strong sub bass great resolution and a little bit less spatial replication and instrument separation than the xmark force they're not quite at the level of those with the overall capacity of the earbuds but the overall sound profile of these i think they sounded really good especially if you're listening to tidal or something you can really make good use of that high resolution these are really a fun pair of earbuds that most listeners especially in untrained ear are going to really enjoy a pretty surprising amount of bass for a small pair of earbuds like this as well now of course if you're more of an audiophile you're going to notice that like i said it's a little bit on the dark end i wish we could boost up the treble a little bit more the eq didn't quite do it for me but regardless still a pretty solid sounding pair of earbuds now of course any kind of adjustments you want to make you can do that in the equalizer right here and of course scrolling down we also have sony's 360 reality audio i didn't turn that on because i don't ever really like the spatial audio from apple or 360 audio on here but some people really do like that and that's a cool feature that again does work with something like tidal for example and we have dse extreme as well if you want to turn that on so otherwise if you go over to system this is where i said you can kind of customize the touch controls but not really like you can only customize left or right so if we tap on the little settings icon there we can choose the left earbud or the right earbud and for each one you get a choice of one of three different preset functions for them so you can either have playback control which gives you this array of settings or you can go to volume control which only gives you two things and so you can't really choose like you can't say single tap do this double tap do that you have to choose a package for each earbud and so that's something that i wasn't really fond of i don't know why they didn't let us customize each individual function like sennheiser does for example hey so i'm editing the video right now and i realized i didn't mention that these do not have wireless charging which for 200 i thought was really surprising i don't really know of many other earbuds that cost nearly this much and don't have wireless charging in 2022 but leave a comment and let me know if that's something you're willing to live without or if you think that that is a deal breaker a big positive is that the link buds s are using bluetooth 5.2 which is the latest version of bluetooth which is great because it allows you to listen to just one earbud at a time while the other one is in the case you're also getting pretty low latency but one thing that i was not seeing with these that i was really hoping to see was a multi-point connection i was really hoping i'd be able to connect the two phones at once now maybe that's something that's going to be updated in a firmware update but at least right now it's not something i'm seeing so the link puts s like i said sony thinks that these are going to be a mid-range pair so they're going to go between the 1000 x mark 4s which are 280 dollars and the 180 regular link buds which have kind of an open ear concept these are 199 so that's what they think are going to be the mid range but i would argue that anybody considering getting the 1000 x mark fours might be just as happy saving the money and getting these in fact many people might even be happier because although you're making some subtle compromises on some of the high-end features or sound quality or active noise cancellation these are really really close in almost all regards also costing 80 less and most importantly the earbud itself is substantially smaller which to me i think is a really important part of a good pair of earbuds so if you guys have any other earbuds that you think i should compare these to let me know i know it's a really competitive space at the 200 price like this the beats fit pro are there jabber elite seven pro are there galaxy buds pro there's a lot of earbuds at that price and there's also a lot of earbuds below this price that would be very compelling for example the galaxy buds 2 although they don't sound as good and c is a little weaker they are also a really small pair of earbuds or maybe something like the sennheiser cx plus but in conclusion these i would say are really an incredible pair of earbuds i love the way they sound they're very small they're very comfortable the compact design i know i keep saying this but that's one of the biggest positives with these the fact that you're getting great anc great sound quality and a lot of features in such a compact design that's still giving you six hours of battery life i think is really a huge win for these but it's also a really competitive space so anybody looking to buy these i mean there's a lot of other earbuds out there that are really competitive but the good news is we are in a way approaching peak earbuds so anybody who buys these i seriously doubt you would have any regrets and i don't think you'd be even tempted to upgrade until these end up breaking sometime way down the line in the future so share your thoughts in the comments below and let me know what you think of the linkbuds apps if you enjoyed the video consider liking and subscribing i'm mike o'brien thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music],Sony Linkbuds S,The 1000x mark iv's are known for great features great sound quality and above all else unbeatable active noise cancellation.But the massive size of them and the second one being the price is out of reach for a lot of people.But in my opinion is going to out-compete the high-end 1000x mark fours. The wf-1000x mark fours have a microphone on the bottom covered with a little mesh screen.They have a proximity sensor so you can actually sense when they're in or out of your ears for auto playing and auto pausing.They also have adaptive sound control which allows you to change between active noise cancellation or transparency. There is a very strong sub bass great resolution and a little bit less spatial replication and instrument separation than the xmark force.The overall sound profile of these are really good especially if you're listening to tidal or something you can really make good use of that high resolution.The ldac is going to be one of the best codecs you can get for listening to music when you're listening to music. mike o'brien reviews the sennheiser noise canceling earbuds.They're a great value at around 200 dollars.They sound great and the design is great.But they don't have wireless charging and a multi-point connection.
52,Ez-iCMA4kYA,Sony LinkBuds S - Are They Really Worth $200?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez-iCMA4kYA,Flossy Carter, yo what's up everybody it's your boy floss back again with another video and today we're going to take a look at the sony link buds s now you can pick these up online i'll throw the link up in the description the price on these 200 bucks i repeat 200 bucks now they come in three different colors you got black white and the best buy exclusive desert sand all right so let's go through the specs real quick now these are supposed to be the lightest earbuds with active noise cancellation now you got bluetooth version 5.2 the codex is sbc aac and ldac no aptx now these are ipx4 sweat and water resistant you got five millimeter drivers with the v1 processor so that's going to give you dynamic sound and excellent anc now you got built-in mics for crystal clear phone calls with wind reduction you got touch controls for playing pause skipping reverse tracks answering and phone calls and you do have your voice assistant now you got active noise cancellation and transparency mode and all of the new sony features like speak to chat weird detection and adaptive sound control now the battery life on these is six hours on a single charge with an additional 14 hours using the charging case now you do got fast charge five minutes to charge will give you one hour worth of playtime and you also have an app that's available for android and ios and let you customize your eq settings and play with some of the other features all right so all that for 200 bucks what's missing there's no wireless charger in the case no multi-point connection so you can't pair two devices at the same time and according to what i'm hearing you can't use either earbud independently now i'm going to test that out for myself now at the end of this video i'm going to answer three questions number one are these worth 200 bucks number two let's compare them to some of the other sony earbuds like the m4s and the link buds original link beds and my final question what should you buy these for 200 bucks or one of my favorite earbuds for under 200 bucks the sennheiser cx plus all right first things first shout out to white shoes back in the building [Music] calm down yo she calm down immediately all right all right no doubt okay so let's recap real quick sony m4s these are the absolute best earbuds for active noise cancellation all right these are god tier noise cancelling ear buds the absolute best now as far as sound quality i do like the bnos the sennheisers the bowels and wilkins the gemini's there's a few earbuds that sound better but none of them can match these for anc okay 280 bucks now sony link buds originals okay now there was a lot of controversy when i did this video let me say this again these are the absolute best earbuds for ambient sound mode and transparency mode look at them they got a big hole in the middle no computerized ambient sound mode is going to be better than having a big hole in your earbuds but the sound quality in these alright the sound quality on these in my opinion is trash but i still love these for what they're made for they're made for ambient sound mode and i give you two perfect examples of why i never got rid of these all right because a lot of people wanted to buy them after the video no i'm keeping these i do love them for ambient sound mode now the other day i had to go to the doctor you don't have to go somewhere and you go in the waiting room and they say have a seat and wait till we call your name you want to play your music but you don't want to miss your name being called these were perfect for that scenario i sat down in the waiting room i had conversations with people in there i could hear them calling people's names from far away the ambient sound mode is incredible but the downside if you're gonna rock these for daily earbuds you're gonna have to carry two pair buds same scenario when i left the doctor's office i got into an uber the guy was playing his music he was talking on the phone i couldn't hear my music at all all i can as his pachata he was playing pachata music arguing with his girl on the phone i could not hear my music at all and i was so pissed off okay but i'm keeping these i perfect for ambient sound mode but the sound quality they're not loud no bass it's just trash but if you work in an office and you want to listen to music and do your work if you got kids uh you babysitting if you want to work out in the gym and have conversations with people go run in go bike riding outside and not get hit by a car these are the best ambient sound mode buds and they're super comfortable the sound quality is just trash all right that brings us to the sony link buds s now these should be right in the middle the same kind of fit all right because these do have the best fit super comfortable the same kind of fit as the link buds but now the v1 processor you're going to get active noise cancellation like the m4s so right in the middle all right so let's grab a little unboxing knife what we got today zombie killer okay here we go all right shoes watch those whiskers let's see what we got here today okay sony link buds s okay and your level's increasing all right there it is okay now one more side note too another reason these link buds are so dope fellas you're watching some scumbag videos and you want to enjoy the sounds okay you know what i'm talking about but you don't want your girl walking on you beating your meat buy a set of link buds i trust me not speaking from experience this is what i've heard okay sony link buds s okay let's see now this is the eco-friendly packaging no plastics all made from recyclable uh automotive parts all right if you're into the environmental protection uh stuff i like that again recyclable paper very flimsy okay now the case now this is another thing that i didn't like about the link buds although i am for saving the environment all of this plastic recycle stuff it just feels cheap it just has a cheapy feel to it you know you spend 200 bucks you want your case even if it's going to be plastic you want it to have that nice matte feel a little bit of weight to it this one just feels a little bit on the cheap side same thing with the link buds not a big deal just you know one of my pet peeves if i spend money on stuff i like to have that quality feel you just have a cheapy feel to it like you see with the link buds you see when you oh little drop test you see when you press the button you see how it kind of it just has a wobbly feel to it you know it just feels cheap just feels cheap okay let's see what you get inside now this is going to be your okay a couple of boxes in here this is going to be your usual books and [ __ ] pluck them and follow them you got 360 reality audio with these you do have dse extreme upscale your music a bunch of different size ear tips now this is very important okay make sure you find the right size that fits you're not going to achieve excellent active noise cancellation if you don't have a nice tight fit giggity so make sure you do that now this one comes with usb type-c the usb-a charging cable not that long y'all only getting one giggity per video okay calm down damn all right here we go so this is the link buds s okay now let's see how they look okay now i will say definitely small and lightweight and these are my kind of earbuds i love earbuds that are discreet looking okay now these are supposed to be the smallest and lightest uh earbuds with anc and they definitely feel ultra lightweight now just for comparison let's pull out the original sony's the m4s you can see the difference okay now the m4 is a lot bigger and you could easily feel the weight right a lot bigger with the weight difference but of course you're getting bigger ear buds you're getting the extra more uh more noise cancellation now with the link buds s let's see the link buttons s and the original link buds now my fingers are so big i want you to be able to see this bro what are you doing here's the difference okay so here's the link buds and the link buds s okay now with the link buds this is the best fit you're gonna get all right these fit in your ears so perfectly and one more thing i hate to keep talking about the original link buds but this is what video is all about comparisons one of the main issues that a lot of people was having with these was the fit all right you if if you can't get the right fit with the original link butts they're gonna sound even more trash than they are now when you put these in your ear if you dig them into your ears and press them down they will sound better but you shouldn't have to do all of that for ear buds you you really just want to pop them in and get a good fit these are very finicky in the fit department so i wonder am i going to have the same issues with these now i'm going to play with different size ear tips and we'll find out shoes shoes plotting on these earbuds okay back in the case there it is all right so let me pause the video i'll grab a phone we'll pair these up and then we'll start our usual testing talk amongst yourselves all right josh we'll be back in first let's take a look at the charging case super lightweight made out of plastic again not the most premium feel to it borderline cheapy feel on the back you got your bluetooth pairing button usb type-c charging slot on the front you got your led indicator and that's pretty much it no branding at all i like that now let's check the magnet strength first we'll start off with minimum shake edge okay no movement intermediate shakage no movement maximum shakeage ah okay excellent strength on the magnets now let's take a look at the actual earbuds and i'm gonna have to agree with sony these might be the lightest earbuds with anc super lightweight okay it almost feels like there's nothing inside of these five millimeter drivers you could barely feel them okay so the earbuds if you're looking for lightweight and all-day comfort these are right here i super duper lightweight now let's take a look at the sony headphones app now it shows you the name of your product you've been powered on and off now you got a picture of the earbuds you got the battery percentage for the left the right and the charging case now this is the status tab you got adaptive sound control now i'm going to leave that turned off but if you turn it on it'll automatically adjust to your environment you got your music controls playing pause skipping reverse tracks and you can raise the lower the volume now the sound tab you got ambient sound control okay so this is going to be your active noise cancellation you got ambient sound level one all the way to 20 and if you want to you can focus on voice or turn it off to save battery now you got speak to chat i tried that out on the m5s i love that feature we'll play with it in a minute now my favorite feature from sony headphones and earbuds the customizable eq this will make the difference for you now if you want to you see my custom eq settings but you do have manual you got speech bass boost treble boost vocal relaxed mellow excited bright you can turn it off and you got two different custom settings now here's mines okay you got your 360 reality audio setup you got your bluetooth connection now if you want to you can prioritize sound quality or stable connection now i'm in the house with wi-fi so we're gonna go with sound quality if you go outside and you want better connectivity prioritize stable connection okay so let's go to system now you got your voice assistant you can have google siri or alexa okay you got your touch sensitive controls for one tap double tap triple tap or long press you can customize those up okay now same thing with the button on the left that's for your ambient sound mode and transparency mode you can customize that too okay you get your optimal earbud fit you got your automatic power off that's your standby time you got your weird detection pauses when you take the headphones out blue resumes your music when you put them back in the earbuds okay you got your voice prompts and you got your software download and for services that's all your 360 reality audio services and your spotify all right so the app is simple and straightforward all right so i just put these in my ears now let's talk about the look the fit and the feel first let's put on ambient sound mode okay now we'll do the ambient sound mode test now the ambient sound mode on this is extremely robotic okay now i can hear everything perfectly clear you can tell us a lot of computerization going into this yeah the ambient sound mode works good but it's very robotic but it works it definitely works i don't have to yell now as far as the fit again these earbuds are so lightweight they feel great okay super lightweight and comfortable matter of fact let's do the head shake test i'm going to start off with minimum shakeage okay no movement intermediate shake edge no movement maximum shakeage no movement at all now let me show you how they look okay now again these are my kind of earbuds very discreet okay very discreet and i can't stress this enough these are comfortable all right very comfortable and again the ambient sound mode it your voice does have a lot of robotic sound to it but it works alright that's what you want you want to be able to hear stuff i'm here i'm tapping my little fingernail on on this paul i can hear every sound alright so now let's do a little sound test all right so i got a classic song cued up we got mob deep win or lose i'm going to start off with max volume my custom eq settings and active noise cancellation turned on all right here we go i'm going into this with an open mind birdman hands rubbing together i promise y'all i'm not going to sing here we go okay so far nice amount of volume here come the bass drop here i go again whether i win or lose okay okay now not too heavy on the base nice amount of volume nice highs and mids let's try this let's go to uh eq okay that's off we'll do break okay it's like oh time to go shopping be the same [ __ ] that we had on [ __ ] looking cute save that for the broads okay okay all right let me go back to my setting okay all right all right all right let's hit pause all right one time for playing pause now again y'all know i got a love hate relationship with sony and i gotta keep it real the sound quality is okay it's not blowing me away now it's light on the bass even with my custom eq settings and bass boost i'm going to try another song matter of fact before i even if i even talk too fast let's do our nip to absolute blue laces too let's just put this to rest right now let me do a real bass test okay just to make sure all right here we go here we go okay okay interesting interesting okay okay all right it's okay it's okay smoking they know that you know i got to get the mogu they know that part that you know once i hit that board then we can stop all right let me be honest with y'all the sound quality in these is pretty good it's pretty good now is it 200 good i'm gonna test it out against the sennheiser cx plus these sound pretty good now i would say the selling point of these so far is the fit okay now you got to look at it like this you're going to take a little bit of hit with the sound quality because the drivers are so small on this but they got to fit them into that small lightweight package so these are it's just like the uh link buds okay you got to know what you're buying when you're buying stuff okay don't buy these looking for extra base earbuds all right you buying these for transparency mode same thing with these you're not buying these for the necessarily the top of the line base and sound quality you're buying these because you want to wear them all day long you want to adapt the sound control and you want thin and light earbuds trust me when you put these on you're going to notice the difference in the lightness as opposed to the m4s these are big heavy earbuds and after a while you're going to want to take them out to relieve some of that pressure these i can easily see wearing all day long okay they pass the head shake test with flying colors yeah and they're very comfortable as far as the sound quality the highs and mids excellent the bass is there it's there but it's just that if you're used to heavy bass earbuds you're going to be like all right these sound a little hollow like not hollow they sound a little light that's the word now i don't know look i'm not an audiophile i never claim to be i don't know all the uh music terminology as far as oh this song sounds narrow this song has the high transducency i don't know all that fancy terminology the easiest way for me to explain how these sound they sound like a watered down version of the m4s they sound a little light a little light like volume i'm not going to complain they're nice and loud but the bass could be more it just could be more bright it could be more it could be more in it that's that's the best word i can it's missing a little bit of it's not going to knock you out of your chair but they sound great already 200 is great i don't know let's do the rest of the testing we'll test the call quality we'll test the lag and let's uh go through some of these other gimmicky features i say gimmicky but let's see if they actually work all right so let's do the reconnection test how long do these take to reconnect to your phone after you take them out and put them in the charging case here we go okay fully in the case wait for it to fully disconnect there it is okay here we go one mississippi two mississippi three mississippi now i just heard a bring in the earbuds and it just popped on i said that's three mississippis all right so now let's confirm if these don't pass the one air blood test can you play music from one earbud while the other one is charging up in the case let's say playing the music okay now i'm gonna take out the left ear bud drop it in the case let's hit play okay so the right side is still playing okay let's put the left side back in wait for it to reconnect okay just connect it let's take out the right side drop it in the case let's hit play on the music the left side is playing now i don't know who said you can't play one earbud at a time but that's completely wrong okay now look let me hit pause in the music i shouldn't even said that at the beginning of the video and shout out to this i was gonna i was gonna really say something negative let me let me just say my man peter all right because he's a he's a [ __ ] noob my man peter called me from last night from best buy like floss mentioned my name in the video because i just found out that you can only use one earbud at a time like if you can't use either earbud independently alright so pete you wanted me to mention your name in the video he's a [ __ ] noob you could definitely use either earbud independently watch i'm going to put the left side in let's hit play on the music the music is playing let's put the right side back in okay the right side connected with the left side in the case let's see playing the music the right side is playing i pete you you noob got me out here looking silly i know see this is why i don't ever take people word for stuff i like to test stuff out live you can definitely play music from either earbud while the other one is charging up in the case okay that's the end of that it does work all right so let's check the touch controls now on the right earbud single tap for playing pause answering and phone calls okay there it is double tap to skip to the next song okay there it is triple tap to go to the previous track okay there it is long press for voice assistant what's the weather for tomorrow okay so all of the touch controls work and on the side note if you single tap on the left earbud that'll activate transparency mode single tap again that'll turn on noise cancellation now let's check the call quality let me call up amaya okay link buds now i'm one of my trap numbers let's see if she answers got max volume all right let's see she may not answer because this is the trap number oh boy here we go hi girlie what took you so long to answer the phone bro i'm come on man what you said you napping oh come on man you i ain't gonna i go i great you're living the dream all right check all right check this out i'm doing a set of headphones you know the routine how do i sound sound good nice and clear are you you you have sleeping are you up okay okay let's check it all right now i'm gonna do the wind test okay i need your honest opinion do you hear any wind no win right now okay what about now you don't have no win okay okay hold up this is max you don't have no win now you serious all right what about uh now you're here okay i'm about to say cause you you cabin cause i got i got the i got the the fan right by my ear you you hear it now okay but is it bad though no oh

gonna call you from an uber all right girlie bye okay okay call quality sounded excellent on my end she said i sounded great and one thing that blew me away yesterday or the other day when i did the sony m5s the wind reduction is great on sony products same thing with these okay now she didn't really start hearing the fan until level three and i had to put this in my ear i had the fan like this then she was like okay i had some wind but just regular wind this would be like me riding my bike even when i ride my bike you don't get this much wind in your face like that she was able to hear me fine we had a little conversation with the wind on okay so core quality on these excellent all right so now let's test for latency and what i mean by that is when you're watching the video is there any delay from the person's lips to what you hear okay so of course i got larry david lampen okay no delay yeah no delay at all perfect for watching your videos all right so now let's try speak to chat now i just enabled that feature and i'm going to turn my time until the mode closes to five seconds okay so let's hit play on the music okay now i'm gonna start talking okay now the music just paused it automatically put me in transparency mode i can hear my voice perfectly fine now i'm gonna be quiet for five seconds and wait for the music to turn back on okay now as soon as i start talking okay you see it just pause and i can hear my voice perfectly i love this feature now it's definitely not a gimmick i could see this coming in handy if you work in an office or if you got kids now for me i like to sing along with my music so this is not going to be good but it should be perfect now see how i was at work i'm talking to my boss right now yeah i'm going to have those reports ready for you by three o'clock okay no problem music is playing all right he just walked back in oh what you said oh yeah one more thing okay okay oh yeah i i'll remember all right i got you we'll wait for the start playing again let me be quiet for five seconds that's pretty dope alright that's pretty dope and it just paused again all right speak the chat is not a gimmick i love it all right so now let's try weird detection now keep your eye on the music playing i'm going to take the earbuds out of my ears you see the music pause now i'm just going to put them back in music started playing instantly okay so the weird detection works all right so now let's talk about ambient sound mode and active noise cancellation now as far as ambient sound mode on these they work perfectly no issues at all i'm just kind of spoiled because i've been using airpod pros for ambient sound mode for so long that i judge everything based on those but these are pdg pretty damn good i'm not going to complain the ambient sound mode works perfectly you just got to get used to sounding like a robot but who cares you can hear everything around you and you can have your conversations okay i like that now let's talk about active noise cancellation i did two tests all right i did the car test and of course one of my favorite tests the baby okay now if you work somewhere imagine you working somewhere and you got this sound in the background are you on the flight you trying to listen to some mob d imagine trying to listen to this song with that in the background let me turn it off that's already getting under my skin you know flossing little kids but i hate the sound i hate that sound alright so i did my active noise cancellation test outside and indoors and i would rank these as follows okay now y'all know i got three tiers we got trash tear okay tear and top tier and of course god tier now you're not gonna find too many god tier earbuds or headphones i would rank these as top tier okay these are really good i have really good noise canceling headphones or earbuds whatever you want to call them but they're definitely not the m4s i they're definitely not the m4s in terms of sound quality and noise cancellation not at all now just to solidify my opinion i'm gonna do a quick side by side test with the m4s and with the link butts s and we're gonna rank these but again ambient sound mode works no issues and active noise cancellation is top tier okay you could block out a lot of them not all of it you could block out a lot of the baby crying okay now with the with the m4s you don't hear nothing okay with these you're still gonna hear a little bit of the baby crying when i went in my car i can hear a little bit of the engine rubbling but not as much i not as much as you know cheap noise canceling headphones or no noise cancellation at all just music so they do work so noise cancellation i would rank these as top tier but definitely not m4 tier now let's do a quick side by side comparison all right so i just did some thorough side by side testing and here's my results now as far as sound quality the sony m4s sound the best now just because something is the most expensive doesn't always mean it's going to be the best but this is one of those times where the most expensive product wins all right the sony m4 sound the best then the link butts s as far as the original link buds for sound quality meh borderline trash okay now for ambient sound mode nothing that i've ever used beats the sony link buds and i'm talking about the bose frames now those are both frames the sunglasses with the speakers above your ears that's that's that's the ultimate ambient sound mode because there's nothing in your ears but you can't hear the music either as far as earbuds that really go inside of your ears and give you ambient sound the link buds are the best only buy these if you're concerned with ambient sound mode or transparency mode do not buy these based on specifically music uh listening now as far as around sony link buttons s where do these fit in exactly where they're at in the middle okay you got the same comfort that you're gonna get with the link buds okay so both of these super comfortable and you got some of the noise cancellation from the m4s not the god tier but top tier so let's go ahead and slide these to the side i would rank these right in the middle now this is going to be my last question matter of fact let's answer those three questions matter of fact let me do a quick test before i do that i want to find out which ones sound better the sennheiser cx plus or the sony link buds s now i just did some more testing and just like i thought the sennheiser cx plus blew the sony link buds s out of the water in terms of sound quality the sennheiser sound better they got better hides in mids and way better bass okay now as far as active noise cancellation both of these are top tier i would rank them about the same but the sennheiser cx plus 150 bucks the link buds s 200 bucks now the only difference is not the only difference other than the sound quality the size okay look at the difference in size so again if you're looking for earbuds that are thinner and lighter and you're going to rock them all day you want something a little bit more smaller and discreet spend the extra 50 bucks and go with the link buds s but if you just want a quality pair of noise cancelling earbuds okay that sound great for under 200 bucks i'm still going with the sennheiser cx plus let's go ahead and wrap this up all right so let me answer those three questions number one audi's worth 200 bucks and the answer is yes and no now for me i would say no okay i don't wear earbuds all day long i'm looking for the best sound and the best noise cancellation i could get these ain't it but i would say yes for somebody that works in an office or you work somewhere where you're going to be wearing your earbuds all day you got to put that into the equation these are some of the most comfortable earbuds around so if you're going to be wearing them for six seven eight hours straight you're gonna you don't mind spending that extra 50 bucks you want something that's going to be comfortable you don't want some big giant earbuds like these you don't want something heavy like these you want something that's lightweight that's going to give you good transparency mode and good active noise cancellation and sound pretty good so no for me i for me i want more bass i want more noise cancellation so i wouldn't spend 200 bucks on these but if you're gonna wear those for eight hours straight then these are worth 200 bucks for you next question how do these rank versus the m4s and the link buds again m4s top tier god tier noise cancellation actually the best noise cancellation on the market but a little bit heavier the link buds best transparency on the market but the sound quality is a lot less these rank right in the middle okay right in the middle of the sony lineup i just wish these would have been 150 bucks then it could have been direct competition with the cx plus which brings me to my last question which one would i personally choose the cx plus or the uh link buds s for me i want bass okay so i'm going with the sennheiser ch plus but i don't have to wear earbuds for all day so i don't really care about having the thinnest and lightest earbuds you might care about that okay so if you're wearing these all day long and you're worried about comfortable earbuds that are lightweight you're gonna love these all right but sony i think i should have bought these out at 150 bucks and i woulda gave these a triple major go just for the comfort alone but right now i'm just gonna give these a single major all right these are major go anyway sony link buds s hit me up in the comments let me know what y'all think about these shout out to everybody rocking with me on facebook foursquare twitter google

53,WfQ-s8RwO7c,Sony Linkbuds S Review - Seriously Impressive!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfQ-s8RwO7c,Jesse Chen, foreign [Music] guys Jesse here so these are the Sony link buds S A surprisingly good pair of Wireless noise canceling earbuds that may have been overshadowed just a little bit by their Bigger Brothers the Sony wf-1000x m4s but you might be wondering why does Sony make two pairs of Premium Wireless noise canceling earbuds that seemingly compete with each other because I know I was and the way I like to think about it is that the xm4s are for the Enthusiast with every feature Under the Sun packed in there but maybe at the expense of a little bit of comfort and convenience while the link buds s are more of a lifestyle pair just geared at fitting into your life as seamlessly as possible and I'm sure you've seen them around those people who seem to have a pair of air pods in their ears like 24 7 no matter what they're doing yeah the link buds s are for those people and to achieve that goal there's a couple of things about these earbuds that are truly exceptional and the first one I want to talk about is that they're incredibly small and lightweight so starting with the case if you've seen any of my other earbud videos in the past before you'll know how much I appreciate this but this case is very pocketable like here it is next to the airpods pro case which I consider to be basically the gold standard of earbud cases in terms of pocketability and the linkbuds case is basically the same size and even smaller in certain Dimensions but in terms of weight the link buds s case is way lighter and basically feels like it's filled with air and I'm really impressed with how lightweight they were able to get it and what's even more impressive is that they were able to achieve that without it feeling cheap like there's very little play in the hinge and it has a very satisfying snapshot the only thing I really have to complain about with the case though is the lack of wireless charging which I feel like for a pair of earbuds in this price range is just not really acceptable especially when you consider that their goal with these earbuds is to just have them fit into your life seamlessly like I have a bunch of wireless chargers just scattered throughout my house and it's so convenient just to be able to plop this on there and not have to fiddle with any cables but I guess if that's not the case for you then it's not really something you need to worry about battery life is pretty good though with six hours in the buds and 14 more hours in the case but the thing that really stuck out to me with these earbuds was just how comfortable they were like these might be the most comfortable earbuds that I've tried in a very long time partially because of the weight like I think these are actually the lightest pair of Wireless noise canceling earbuds on the market right now and also with just how small they are in the way that they're shaped they fit so well into my ears and really just kind of disappear and I legitimately forget that they're in there sometimes they also don't really stick out of your ears that much like they're very flush so if you want to put your head down on a pillow or something like that these should be just fine for that if they were looking for a pair of earbuds that you can keep in all the time you know mission accomplished because these are very comfortable they're also really great for working out as well like fit wise I had no issues no matter what I was doing they stayed playing planted in my ears but also with again just how lightweight they were a lot of the times with the heavier earbuds like if you're running or something like that every time your foot strikes the ground you can kind of feel the weight of the earbud shifting around in the ears and it's a little bit uncomfortable but with these that just wasn't the case at all and they're also ipx4 water resistant so you don't have to worry about sweating in them and ruining them so yeah good for working out in terms of features of course we've got active noise cancellation and transparency mode both of which I think are good but definitely not like the best out there like I wouldn't exclusively get these for that purpose but I think they're good enough for most people in most situations they did have this interesting focus on voice feature though which is basically supposed to block out all the noise during active noise cancellation except for voices um personally I I don't know if it actually does anything because I was turning it on and off and I could not tell a difference we've also got touch controls on the side of the earbuds which are still not my favorite but but they work I just don't really like how easy it is to accidentally activate and every time you do use them there's just this really unpleasant pounding sound when you tap on your ears so yeah not my favorite but they do work these also carry over a lot of the same features that were in the xm4s and the Sony headphones app like automatic detection of actions like if you're walking it'll be able to detect that you're walking or if you're sitting it'll be able to tell you that as well and then you can set different actions to have different sound settings and I think that's a really cool feature if let's say like when you're walking you want to have transparency mode on so you can be aware of your surroundings and then when you're sitting you want noise cancellation on because you want to block everything out and another feature I wanted to mention that was also in the xm4s was the uh speak to chat function this again I think is a great idea but in practice I found it to be just a little bit clunky to use but basically the idea is that when the earbuds are in your ears they should be able to tell when you start talking and then pause whatever you're listening to and turn on Ambient sound mode which is a great idea but for me there were a couple of issues the first being that it takes like half a second too long to activate and usually I find it a lot more convenient just to pull an earbud out and talk to whoever I need to talk to I also found that it was pretty easy to accidentally activate by coughing or clearing your throat which combined with the fact that it takes like 15 seconds for the music to come back makes it pretty annoying to have on and I just left it off most of the time because of that so overall really great idea and I really want Sony to keep on working on that feature but for now I think it's a feature that I'm not going to use okay so lastly before we talk about sound let's do a quick mic test so you guys know what these sound like in calls alright so the audio you're hearing now is coming from the mics on the Sony linkbuds S and yeah this is what they sound like let me know what you think do they sound good bad just okay yeah put it down in the comment section down below okay so last but not least how do these sound and overall I gotta say very impressed with the audio quality on the they don't have the most base or the most Clarity in the vocals but overall very pleasant sound signature they're a bit more mid forward than the xm4s so vocals tend to jump out a little bit more from the rest of the track which leads to a bit more clarity I think but they definitely don't have as much bass as those so you don't get as much of that rich full sounding sound signature as you do with the xm4s and I think sound signature wise these are actually very similar to the airpods pros which I honestly don't think is a bad thing because I quite like the way those are tuned alright so at the end of the day these are a very solid pair of Wireless noise canceling earbuds I've tried a lot of them in the past and these might be in my top five like I don't just value audio quality when I take a look at a pair of earbuds because how they fit into my life is really important to me and that's part of the reason why I really like the airpods pro and these are very similar in the sense that they're very easy to live with with just how small and lightweight they are but yeah overall there's just really not a whole lot wrong with these and I think my only real complaint is the lack of wireless charging which for me is pretty inconvenient but I know a lot of people don't even use it so depends on your situation but apart from that these are awesome and that's even before you take into account the price so these retail for two hundred dollars but I've been seeing them on sale for as little as 130 recently and I gotta say for that price these are an absolute steal anyways those are my thoughts let me know what you think in the comment section down below like if you liked it sub if you loved it and I'll catch you guys in the next one peace foreign [Music],Sony Linkbuds S,The Sony link buds S are a surprisingly good pair of Wireless noise canceling earbuds that may have been overshadowed just a little bit by their Bigger Brothers the Sony wf-1000x m4s.The first one I want to talk about is that they're incredibly small and lightweight.The thing that really stuck out

54,hibFV0HKwvw,Sony LinkBuds Review - 6 Months Later,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hibFV0HKwvw,6 Months Later," The Sony LinkBuds are weird buds. They go against the trend of wireless noise canceling earbuds by embracing an open design where ambient sound is let in, allowing you to hear everything in your surroundings. After six months of using them, my general feelings towards them are a bit mixed and let's walk through why that is, who I think these earbuds are actually for, and if in 2022, you can really justify paying $180 US dollars for earbuds that don't have any noise cancellation.For the past 6 months, the main thing I’ve used my LinkBuds for are phone and video calls at work because their mic quality is pretty good. Here's how their mics sound compared to some other common earbuds I have. Alright, and first we're gonna start off with the Sony LinkBuds. This is how their mic sound and this is the best they're like, they're probably ever gonna sound. I'm in a pretty quiet room right now and I'm recording this on my studio display, not with the studio displays mics, so these are the LinkBuds mics and then just recording it in QuickTime. So let me know how you think their mics sound. Alright, and these are the brand new Sony LinkBuds S. They're noise canceling earbuds and this is how their mics sound. All right, and these are the WF-1000XM4s. This is how their mics sound. Let me know what you think, and these are the brand new Google Pixel Buds Pro. They’re noise canceling earbuds at a great price point. This is how they're mic sound. All right and these are of course the classic AirPods second generation. This is how their mic sound.I’ve also used them occasionally for listening to music in the background when I want to still need to be able to hear what’s going on around me Or if I want to make myself available to talk to others in my household, but in general, these situations are uncommon for me. Typically I prefer using noise canceling earbuds, especially in noisy environments, because I don't have to turn up the volume as much as on a pair of earbuds, like the LinkBuds.They do feature adaptive volume control but I never enable this feature on any earbud because of health concerns. Hearing health is something I try to be very conscious of so I don't typically want earbuds where I have to crank up the volume to a pretty high level just to be able to hear music or a podcast. This is why I typically will gravitate towards earbuds that are in ear and have noise cancellation. Although, there are a lot of people out there I know that don’t like the feeling of noise cancellation.. If that's you, these buds may be more appealing to you, but I think you should still ask yourself the question: do you want earbuds that make no effort to block out any outside sound?or would you prefer something more like the The Google Pixel Buds which are in-ear earbuds that let in ambient sound, but because of their design, they do attempt to block out some sound by creating a light seal in your ear. Now, one thing that may sway your answer to that question is sound quality.The sound quality on the LinkBuds is decent, but not best-in-class by any stretch and this is due to that open design, the highs and mids, they're fine. But because these earbuds have such an open design to them, you're basically going to lose out on all bass and because of that, I wouldn't really recommend getting the LinkBuds for just listening to music. Now when it comes to music controls, the LinkBuds also leave a lot to be desired. You can go into the Headphones app which Sony uses to control all of their headphones, to set what you want the double tap on each bud to control, but in a world where other earbuds like the Pixel Buds Pro and Sony WF-1000XM4s exist and allow you to play, pause, skip tracks, trigger a phone assistant and turn on and off noise cancellation, the LinkBuds’ limited control options, leave a lot to be desired. Another thing that leaves a lot to be desired with the LinkBuds is their case, for $180 dollars, I think anything in this price range should have a case forward to wireless charging,The LinkBuds case only supports USB-C for charging. Now, one thing Sony did an excellent job with, with the LinkBuds is comfort. These earbuds are extremely comfortable. There are two main reasons for this, one, the earbud’s speaker sits outside of your ear canal, which is a design that will inherently be more comfortable and second, they include a stabilizer arc loop that helps the earbuds stay in your ear. It’s made out of a very flexible elastic material, allowing it to conform to your particular ear shape and they come in multiple sizes. I've been able to wear these earbuds for hours and they're very similar in their feeling to Apple's second generation AirPods. And that when you put them in, you kind of forget they're in your ears. The battery life on the LinkBuds is rated for 5.5 hours & 17.5 hours total with the charging case, And in my experience, 5.5 hours seems about right when I've used these earbuds though, to be fair, I have not stressed tested these as much as I would another pair of earbuds because they're not really suited for my needs in terms of day-to-day earbud use. And this brings me to the obvious downside to using the LinkBuds for normal earbud tasks. When I want to be able to block out as much background noise as possible, these aren’t a good choice for that scenario. and more often than not, I find I want buds that have the ability to block out noise because it helps me concentrate more on a podcast or even when listening to music in the background because you’ll pick up on way more detail in your music and I find the experience generally more relaxing. So now, let's talk recommendations, who do I think the LinkBuds are for, and do I recommend them? And that’s a really hard question to answer because I’m not really sure who these earbuds are actually for at this price. They do come with water and sweat resistance, support for the Google and Amazon assistants and their mic quality and comfort are excellent. So if you want a pair of buds with great mic quality, they’re great for that. however, you really have to love not being able to block out any background noise at all. If that's you, you're gonna love these. But if you like me and you want earbuds that have the ability to block out background noise, have great sound quality, and overall good comfort, the Sony buds I’d recommend are actually the Sony WF-1000XM4s, which are still my favorite pair of earbuds to use and we’ve done a review of them if you want to learn more about those that I’ll link here in the video and in the description below. But the XM4s, they cost about $100 more than the LinkBuds. Now, to me, it's been worth it, but if you want something closer to the LinkBuds price that offers noise cancellation, take a look at the Sony LinkBuds S which were released a few months ago for $200 US dollars,And we'll have a full review of those earbuds out on the channel soon, so if you want to see that review, make sure you subscribe to the channel. So those are my thoughts on the Sony LinkBuds, they’re great for phone and video calls if you want a comfortable set of buds that don’t block out any noise. But for anything else, I’d look at another set of buds. If you're interested in purchasing a pair of the LinkBuds , LinkBuds S, or the WF1000-XM4s, I've left purchase links here that you can click on in this video and down in the description below if you'd like to learn more.

55,zoHe2-yU5jA,Sony LinkBuds Review: A Shocking And Surprising Design,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoHe2-yU5jA,CNET, hey there these are sony's new link buds and i gotta say i was a bit surprised when i first got my hands on them for starters they have an actual name you can easily remember and not some funky model number and then there's the whole ring thing kind of weird right let's talk about that [Music] so as far as the name goes sony says the concept behind the link buds was to make an always-on product to link your online and offline worlds i'm not quite really sure what that means but the idea is that these buds are supposed to be really comfortable to wear around all the time while not shutting you off from the outside world that's where the ring comes in these are open earbuds like the standard airpods so they allow ambient noise in but in some ways they're more akin to samsung's galaxy buds live earbuds aka the beans because they have a stemless design and although they're not exactly kidney shaped they are elongated they come in two color options speckled white and speckled carbon and sony says both the case and buds are made out of recycled plastic which may be a first for earbuds they cost 180 dollars i'll get into weather i think they're a good value toward the end of the video but they're basically in line with what the airpods third generation and galaxy buds live cost when they first launched i'd say the one big advantage these have over both the airpods third generation and the galaxy buds live is that they're designed to stay in your ears really securely i was actually able to get a good fit with the buds live and a pretty good fit with the air pods 3 but i've seen plenty of comments from people who couldn't get the buzz live to stay in their ears and not everybody can get a secure fit with the air pods which is why you see all those airpods winning accessories selling on amazon the link buds come with five different sizes of fins or arc supporters as sony calls them medium is the default size but there's also extra small small large and extra large the large and extra large worked well for my ears and the thin wedges under that top ridge on your ear and helps lock the butt in place i wouldn't say these lock in quite as well as the beats fit pro but they're arguably more comfortable particularly if you're someone who doesn't like having an ear tip jammed in your ear it's pretty self-explanatory how the buds fit in your ears but the app does have a tutorial that shows you how they're supposed to fit what's interesting is that the way the ring sits in your ear it's partially hidden so people can't really see it from the outside anyway it just looks like you're wearing regular buds you may not totally forget you're wearing earbuds and they may not fit everybody's ears perfectly but i found them quite comfortable to wear from time to time i did make little adjustments to how they sat in my ears and how the ring is positioned in your ear can impact sound quality slightly you can tweak this out a bit in the companion app for ios and android but changing the eq settings doesn't dramatically change the sound profile engaging bass boost for example only gets you a touch more bass these use sony's v1 integrated processor which is its version of a bluetooth system on a chip it's bluetooth 5.2 and like the sony wf-1000x mark iv the link buds unfortunately do not support multi-point bluetooth pairing that feature allows you to connect the butts to two devices at the same time like your smartphone and your computer and easily switch audio back and forth between the devices sony says these have 12 millimeter drivers and the buds are ipx4 splash proof i got some shots of them in the rain was a little worried i might have gotten them a little too wet but after i dried them off they worked fine so you can definitely use them for workouts and runs and they did stay in my ears when i ran with them these are not noise-cancelling earbuds and they don't have a transparency mode because they're naturally transparent if you pause your music it basically sounds as if you're not wearing earbuds [Music] the link buds do have a few extra features and a couple of them are pretty cool these have ear detection sensors so when you take a bud out of your ear your music automatically pauses and then resumes when you put the butt back in your ear and yes you can use a single bud for audio listening and leave the other one charging in the case if you want the buds have touch controls and they work just fine but what's cool is if you want instead of tapping on a bud you can tap on your face just in front of your ear sony calls the feature wide area tap and you can turn it on or off in the companion app it's two taps to pause your music and three taps to advance the track you can also set taps for volume controls the link buttons also carry over sony's speak to chat feature found in its wf-1000x mark 4 buds and wh 1000x mark 4 over ear headphones that's the feature where if you start talking to someone your music automatically pauses so you can have a conversation with them music then resumes about 15 seconds after you stop talking if you talk to yourself a lot or maybe talk to your pets too much you might want to turn the feature off in the app it does use up a touch more battery life when you have it on battery life with these guys is rated up to 5.5 hours at moderate volume levels so it's not stellar but the case does provide a couple of extra charges and has a quick charge feature that gives you 90 minutes of playback time from a 10 minute charge how do these sound well good but not as good as the wf-1000 xbox 4 and they fall a tad short of the airpods third generation which offer improved sound from the airpods second generation they have a nice open natural sound well balanced with good detail and just enough bass but like a lot of open earbuds they just don't deliver the same kind of bass response as a set of noise isolating ear buds and while they have sony's dse digital sound enhancing feature that does make your music sound a little fuller there's no support for sony's near lossless ldap codec like there is with the wf-1000x mark iv they also have the same issue that all open earbuds have in noisier environments they let sound in so whatever you're listening to competes with whatever ambient sound you encounter for a lot of people that's a feature not a bug for safety reasons you often want to hear the outside world but you should be aware that despite having an adaptive volume control feature that automatically adjusts the volume to your environment some folks may have an issue with how loud these play i paired them with an iphone 13 pro and the google pixel 4 plus and stream music from apple music spotify and quobas there was some variation volume levels across devices and streaming surfaces and i do think how your ear shaped and how the speaker ring sits in your ear can affect volume levels some people may think they play plenty loud while others may not particularly when you're outdoors when you're dealing with competing sounds including wind noise [Music] sony is targeting the link buds at jen's ears and i guess it doesn't want to kill younger peeps ears which i do appreciate with my ears anyway the airpods 3 play a little bit louder and had slightly bigger sound overall so did the galaxy butts live but those can distort a bit at higher volume levels as i said sony's wf-1000x mark iv have these beat for sound quality but weirdly the link buds are better for making voice calls sony won't say how many microphones the link butts have i see only one external one on each butt but it says it's improved the noise reduction algorithm and callers told me they thought my voice sounded clear with minimal background noise in the noisy streets of new york city so these in fact have surprisingly good voice calling performance i just hope sony brings that same new algorithm to the wf-1000x mark iv with a firmware upgrade all right so i got some traffic going by here it's pretty noisy in the background hopefully you can lean pretty decently yeah your voice is coming in super clear right now don't really hear much going on i'll finish by saying that i'm generally impressed with what sony has done with the link buzz and that's not just because it gave them a real name open earbuds are difficult to do well and these definitely have an innovative design not only are they very comfortable to wear but they stay in my ears well and even if they don't play quite as loud as i'd like in noisier environments they do sound good for open buds and i am a fan of the speak to chat and wide area tap features these are an excellent alternative to the airpods particularly for android users who can't take advantage of some of the airpods apple only extra features like spatial audio if you just have trouble keeping airpods in your ears they do have google fast pair the link butts are a little expensive at 180 but i do think there's room for some discounting while they feel premium enough they're missing features like wireless charging and both the case and buds don't quite feel as solid and substantial compared to what you get with the wf-1000xmark4 so like the galaxy buds live i think you'll see the street price on these come down fairly quickly but let me know what you guys think does the link buzz design seem appealing to you sound off in the comment section and

56,aNikTwG8b-Y,Sony LinkBuds Review | Truly Unique True Wireless Earbuds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNikTwG8b-Y,Tech Spurt, so sony has just launched a fresh new pair of true wireless earbuds a very unique pair indeed and no they're not the latest wf model they're rather actually a completely new brand called the sony link buds these are a pair of truly open in-ear headphones allowing you to have a conversation and be aware of your surroundings while simultaneously enjoying your music or that rogan fella telling you that scientists are injecting you with their jizz juice for shits and giggles or whatever else you fancy according to sony their new link buds are your perfect partner wherever you go pretty sure they just described a hip flask there but whatever maybe these will be a close second they'll be released soon for 150 quid or 180 euros and i've been testing them for a couple of weeks now so question is are the sony link buds actually worth picking up for that premium price point well here's my full review and for the latest greatest deck please do pog subscribe and ding that notifications bell cheers so let's start as always with the design and you can pick up the link buds in a choice of just two colors white or black nothing too exciting i'm definitely quite digging the design kind of looks like a soft mint glued to a hula hoop certainly very unique but the best part is they are incredibly light and really really comfortable to wear even if you have them lodged in your lug holes all afternoon long they're only 4.1 grams each so to be honest you can have them in there for hours and forget you've even got them in you've also got a flexible arm bit which just nestles up against your ear flap and helps to hold the link buds firmly in place and the arm comes in five different shapes and sizes as well you can easily swap them out to replace it with a different one so you should be able to find one that suits you no worries and of course with that open-ear design the sony link buds are basically meant to sit in your ears all afternoon long you don't have to keep on whipping them out every time you want to have a conversation with someone you can just stop your music or your podcast or whatever chat away leaving them in there and then resume your audio again once they've buggered off and quite often it is that constantly taking your buds out putting them back in again that can result in a lot of ear fatigue so you definitely do not get any of that with the link buds and they're also ipx4 splash resistant as well so noise if you want to rock them out in the rain found that particularly handy when i buggered off up to sunderland for the weekend and the sun part of that near definitely a complete misnomer the sunnylink buds support bluetooth 5.2 connectivity got fast pair and android phones as well which worked to charm setup took literally a few seconds and i thought i could easily repair the sony link buds with a different android device or whatever else if i needed to as well but of course whether you actually get on with the sony link buds or not depends on your feelings towards that open ear design they are absolutely ideal if you want to rock them in a workplace or somewhere else where you need to be aware of what is going on around you so for instance personally i found that they were fantastic when i was at home expecting a courier to turn up any moment usually i have to just like play my music quietly so i don't miss the doorbell but with these things i could listen to a podcast listen to music anywhere i roamed about the house and i could still hear the doorbell when it finally went off they're also pretty good if you've got a sprog for instance constantly making demands of you so you're not having to constantly switch on awareness mode or take out one bird to actually hear what they're wibbling on about this time although of course in those cases you might prefer a bit of active noise cancellation however when i tried using the sony link buds when i hit the high street or when i was trying to travel somewhere by train or by tube for instance just i just gave up straight away basically podcasted audiobooks had to jack up to the maximum volume to actually hear what on earth was being said music just you can't really hear the finer details at all as well because of course you're getting all of the surrounding noise filtering in so these things are definitely made to be used indoors or in quieter environments that is for sure i certainly couldn't use them as my full-time pair but they are great as a backup when needed now certainly one of the funkiest features of the sony link buzz is the touch controls because you don't actually tap the buds themselves you can just tap your face just in front of the buds instead and it just works flawlessly as well literally double tap your left cheek and your music will pause double tap your left cheek again and it will resume it just works every time flawlessly it's utterly bonkers you might be thinking yeah sure that's very snazzy and all but it's actually the bloody point well i found it really handy actually if i was wearing a woolly hat or whatever to protect my baldy bones from the elements you can pull that down up over your ears and then just tap on your cheeks when you need to control your tunes or whatever i only ever had a problem one time with the touch controls and that was when i was rather vigorously chewing on a double decker and my music just suddenly paused and i figured that was probably down to my jaw motions but i tried replicating it and got bloody nowhere it was just a one-off basically the controls are fairly comprehensive as well you can double tap your left cheek to either pause or resume your music you can triple tap in order to skip forward a track meanwhile the right cheek is reserved for assistant functionality so a double tap allows you to speak to the assistant and make your demands and a triple tap will get the assistant to read out the current time and also give you an update when there's any notifications waiting around for your attention and if you happen to think that the google assistant is a load of old bollocks well you've also got full alexa support on the sony link buzz if you prefer the amazon effort now sony has chucked in a few familiar features with the sony link buds as well so for instance you've got that speak to chat which you can enable or disable within the sony headphones app if you're not aware of this feature basically just pauses whatever you're listening to when the headphones detect that you are speaking unfortunately there's somebody who likes to jabber on to himself cursed to himself and occasionally have a bit of a sing-along with whatever i'm listening to that feature really does not work for me so yeah just kept that knocked right the off the entire time you've also got an auto volume feature which can lower the volume of your music or whatever again if you enter a quiet environment but as i mentioned before i wouldn't recommend using the sony link buds anywhere but a quite quiet environment so it's again not really essential and as usual that's funny headphones app includes a built-in equalizer as well with various presets you can enhance the the vocals the bass whatever you fancy i'll just have a manual tinker around with if you want that's for the actual audio quite an important part of it all well this is powered by a 12 mil ring driver and you've got sony's v1 processor on there which offers up features like the dse sony's digital sound enhancement engine to improve the clarity of lower res audio you've got support for 360 audio yada yada as well and the sound quality is pretty decent the only problem with the open-ear design is that it doesn't feel like the sound has actually been pumped directly into your ears more than it's been played around your ears so it doesn't sound quite as full bodied as what you would get with just a standard pair of true wireless earbuds you know i found the sony link buttons were great for podcasts great for audio books for that sort of shenanigans as well and music is fairly enjoyable through these things as well although if you want that sort of really full-on intense musical experience then definitely go for a proper pair of in the earbuds instead oh yeah i actually remembered to trim my ear hair before shooting this video as well for a bloody chain so all these close-ups and everything hopefully not too much ear bush action going on there you're welcome now fun with the sony link buds i got around five ish hours of audio playback on a single charge before the buds needed to be recharged again so not far off sony's on estimates and not bad at all for true wireless here but it's about sort of average and when they have given up the ghost way you can just pop them back inside of their highly adorable wii case you'll get a couple of extra charges from the case before that also needs to be powered up in a few minutes and the case will give you an hour of playback the case itself is actually made up from broken up recycled car parts blended with elements of stone it's environmentally friendly and i've got to say it feels absolutely lush as well it's got that sort of lovely textured finish to it but also strangely smooth kind of like a bizarrely light pebble and also it's just utterly charming compared with most of the true wireless earbud cases look at how dinky it is i mean this thing will slip into any bag or pocket or let's face it bodily orifice without any complaints whatsoever and it is well and truly cat proof as well the number of times this thing has been battered off of my table by one of my cats the only problem is that when it hits the floor does tend to pop up and despite the fact you've got the little button release thing there and then the buds go flying off everywhere and then when the the case itself actually needs to be recharged as well because it's run out of battery where it's just type c usb port around back as well you've also got a little button there for repairing so there you have it that in a nutshell is the sony link buds fresh new pair of truly innovative true wireless earbuds certainly not for everyone best used in quieter indoor environments where you need to be aware of your surroundings like a workplace if you're waiting for the doorbell something like that as i say can be yours soon for the princely sum of 150 quid or 180 euros but are you tempted it'd be great to hear your initial impressions down in the comments below please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell for more on the latest and greatest deck

57,luojyDJwXfA,This feels WRONG - Sony Linkbuds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luojyDJwXfA,ShortCircuit," - I'm really excited for these that the- - [Jono] Oh no, it broke. - [Brandon] Jono broke the press kit it's not Sony's fault. (Jono laughing) - Way to go Jono. (Jono laughing) - [Jono] It wasn't my fault. - [Brandon] It kinda was though. - Oh, there's goo on it. The conventional wisdom has always been that in ear headphones isolate you from the outside world. And we've used technology to get around that to a degree with things like transparent modes that use microphones to pass through ambient sounds. But the LinkBuds take a far more holistic approach to this problem with a shape that I would've actually never imagined ever seeing in an earphone. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to open this box. - [Jono] Check that little cap on your right. (indistinct) - This paper. - [Jono] Yeah that part. - [Brandon] Sheer brute force. - [Jono] Oh, he forced it. - Okay. Oh, please tell me it's not an NFT. YouTube sent this cringe NFT display thing to me a little a while ago. Just didn't know what to say. Sustainability is extremely important to us at Sony which is why the LinkBuds and their charging case are made using recycled plastic materials and have plastic free packaging. Not the press version apparently. I swear to you, this thing's really cool. I can't get the box open. And then I can't get the other box open. But trust me, it's really cool. Oh, all right. Okay. This is actually pretty cool. It's all just cardboard padding. Like it. Very compact charging case. No wireless charging on the charging case, but it has a lot of other redeeming qualities. USB C charging. There's your pairing button so nice, simple pairing process. It's really small. Here actually hold on. I've got my AirPods Pros in my pocket. So you can see it's thicker than the AirPods Pros, right? But in both other dimensions it's actually substantially smaller. Like other wireless earphones. The case acts as a charger, holding 12 hours worth of juice while the earphones themselves hold five and a half for a total of seventeen and a half. That should be good enough for most people's long day. And if you want to top up the earphones quickly, Sony quotes, 90 minutes of use off of a 10 minute quick charge. And then I believe it's 90 minutes total to fully charge the assembly. Now this is where the similarities to other earphones pretty much die in a fire. Look at these things, Brandon. - [Brandon] That's so cool. - They've got kind of this bulbous almost figure eight shape. And you can see the analogous components, right? Like here's the part that goes into the canal. And here's the part that sits in the little, like, you know concave spot in your ear, right? So relative to the AirPod you can kind of see how it's gonna sit. But it's got a hole in it. - [Jono] It's a donut. - This is what I meant when I said they've taken a much more holistic approach. Get it? Pun very much intended. To making it so that you can hear your surroundings. The driver is actually a ring shaped driver around the outside here. So what they've done is they've created a completely actually open backed in ear headphone. Okay, I'm gonna put it in. They've got these little silicone loops to help hold them into place. Hopefully my ears aren't too waxy today. So it kind of sits like that. One of their priorities for this product was all day comfort with the being that because they're not cutting you off from the rest of the world, you are able to wear them all day while still carrying on normal conversations or safely walking around in the city and not getting, you know, run over by a car or a train or whatever the case may be. I believe they've actually partnered with Niantic. And they've talked about Pokemon go as a specific use case for these headphones. They've also boasted that they have excellent ambient noise rejection for the microphone. So if you wanna carry on a conversation with someone, we'll have to do a test call with Jono. You gotta way to record it real quick. Actually okay, I guess I'm not gonna use this phone. I'll use the one that is preloaded with their application because these aren't released yet so you can't just grab it from the app store or the play store. Thanks to Vessi footwear for sponsoring this video. Vessi shoes are known for being lightweight, easy to pack comfortable, and most importantly water resistant with their Dyma-tex technology. Their everyday move lineup is designed to keep up with your active lifestyle with added support in the mid sole and better breathability. It's also got a pull tab to make taking them off and putting them on super easy and they're made creature free. So you don't have to worry about that. You'll wanna wear them everywhere. So keep your dry and save $ 25 by visiting the link in the video description and using offer code shortcircuit. Crap, Jono, you gotta sign into your Apple ID. I gotta say these typing sounds are tripping me the crap out. Because I don't feel like I'm wearing headphones. So you know how with some headphones you get that like inside your skull sensation. - [Brandon] Yeah. - I'm definitely getting that a little bit. They're very comfortable. I mean, obviously I haven't spent an entire day with them and I actually sleep with my AirPods Pros and my Tone Free FP8. But they're extremely comfortable for me. I don't know if I could say that about these yet. The XM4's from Sony I found were a little bit too bulky for that. And the touch would often get activated by lying down on my pillow. So I wasn't able to do that with those, But these seem at least on first glance, extremely comfortable cause they don't put pressure on the canal. It's all up here. They're really light too. Like extremely light. - [Jono] How are you doing today? - That's really weird. Just how, how do I describe this? - [Jono] Is it like I'm right there? - With the typing sounds and with this phone call. It sounds like you're coming from like in between my ears. (Jono laughs) - [Jono] I'm in your head - Now this is interesting. The press deck for this talks about wide area tap. Whatever that means. And it seems like the guy in the picture is like tapping his head. Whoa - [Brandon] That's cool. - [Jono] Whoa - Could you hear that? - [Jono] Yeah, I can hear that. (group laughing) - [Jono] I can hear that from here though. - That's crazy. Yeah. So that was one of the things we asked Sony about. If I'm on the bus or if I'm in a quiet room, will people be able to hear my music? The answer is sort of. Because they're in ears, what sounds loud to you is gonna be pretty quiet for everyone around you, but because they're open backed there's no isolating layer that will prevent sounds from leaking out of them. So yes, it's possible. They're also ridiculously loud right now. This is just the default. - [Brandon] Then it's not that bad probably. - [Jono] Yeah. - You definitely have to tap with intent. This is what I would consider to be a reasonable listening volume for me when I'm not like jamming out, but I'm sitting and working. Can you guys hear it? - [Jono] No. - [Brandon] No. - No, okay. This is like, I'm cleaning the house and I need energy. - [Jono] I think like a little bit. (indistinct) - These sound great. - [Brandon] Better than the XM4's? - They're different from the XM4's. So the thing about the XM4's is that like most earphones they're a closed back design. So even though you can run them in a transparent mode, right? That's always gonna be artificial sounding and there's always gonna added background hiss or added artifacts from doing it that way. Whereas these are allowing ambient sound so I can hear the person who opened the door over there. Hi, how you doing? - [Denniss] Hello. - [Jono] Denniss. - But the music also has a more open and natural sound. That's one of the key benefits of open backed headphones when we're talking about full size headphones as well. So if you like an open back sound these are just gonna completely change your world. They sound really good. Oh, for crying out loud, you will not be able to listen to music while I go for through the app here. Speak to chat. You can start conversations while wearing the headphones simply by starting to talk. Yeah. I wanna experience that. Try saying things like hello while music is, oh, okay. So it pauses your music. Oh, that's really cool. It will resume while you are speaking and will close if approximately 15 seconds passes after you finish speaking or you've operated the headphones. I would make it less than 15 seconds. That seems like a lot. Although I guess if you're going back and forth with someone. They've got some EQ presets here. Pretty cool. And then I believe you can also edit it. Very nice. I wouldn't mind if these were a little more granular. This is cool. The ear shape analysis thing, I've run this with previous Sony products before. It actually does appear to make a small difference. - [Brandon] You know honestly I almost can't tell your wearing headphones, with your hat. - Yeah. Cool, right? And they actually have what, I think a really cool look to them. Like I could see these being a conversation starter when someone does notice that you're wearing them. They've got support for adaptive volume control. So if the ambient sound gets louder, they will try to overpower it, If you're into that. Personally I think you should always control volume yourself to keep it at a safe level. Wide area tap. Super cool. That was on by default. And you can actually configure the tap operations. So there's no single tap because obviously that would cause problems, right? If you just, you know, accidentally slapped yourself for example, that might start playing music. So it's only double and triple tap. That is one drawback could see to this product is that you can't have as many different functions, but because you can program the left and the right individually I think you can kind of overcome that. Four functions is a fair bit. I'm gonna turn the screen recording off now cause I wanna listen to a little bit more music on this puppy. Man. Other earphones try to get this sound. With if like digital sound processors and you know adding like an auditorium effect or like a open sound stage wide sound stage effect. Nothing is ever quite right. But an open backed earphone. Now to be clear there are far more open back earphones. The regular AirPods, for example have a much more open back sound than the AirPods Pros. But this is more open than I've ever experienced before. I can say that definitively. There's a hole in it. It's open. I'm just talking to you. And what's interesting about that. Is that actually carrying on a conversation with you is not as easy as an earphone like this in a specific transparent mode because they're using like voice detection to find voices around you and amplify them for you and they're plumbing them right into your ears. But this is more natural. These sound great for $179.99. - [Brandon] 179 US? - Yeah. They're like reasonable actually - [Brandon] Oh Man, I'm tempted. - Man, I'm not gonna be able to daily drive them. Because ANC is actually a lot of what I use my earphones for. A lot of the time I'm not even listening to anything. I just have the ANC on because I find my life a little overwhelming. But if it was just about the music, boy are these ever cool? - [Brandon] What about gaming? - Gaming's a tough one because I would say that gaming is more about immersion than a lot of the other things that I do. But the funny thing is that I actually use open back headphones for gaming. I use Sennheiser HD 600's because when I'm gaming, when I'm in my computer room I don't have to worry about distractions or anything like that. I want the best possible sound. And for me, open backed is a more natural, better sound. So I would absolutely use them for gaming but maybe when I'm out in public where there's distractions all over the place where I want to dial in. Your mileage may vary though. Maybe you're on the bus and you like, need to hear the next stop or the train, right? So you guys can check them out.

58,0qx6BIGgIGc,Sony LinkBuds Review - The Worlds First Open-back earbuds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qx6BIGgIGc,WhatGear, so when it comes to sony products i've always appreciated them a little bit more when they add a little bit of that japanese authenticity to them and these the sony link buttons do this quite literally because these earbuds and charging case are encapsulated in a unique material made from recycled japanese car parts and natural stone and the end result is a soft touch hard shell with a unique speckled pattern and it kind of has this organic feel to it like a smooth stone washed up on a sandy shore and because of this eco-friendly manufacturing process no two sets of sony link buds will have the exact same pattern which makes each and every set of link buds unique and i think this is a great design feature because you don't want to be like everybody else do you and it's also good because sony is recycling cars that are no longer on the road in order to pave the company's road to a zero environmental footprint by 2050 and this could mean the playstation 8 could look like origami and of course sony's eco-mindedness carries over to the packaging as well it's 100 free of plastics and even 8 smaller in volume compared to the already incredibly eco-friendly xm4s packaging and you might be thinking this is unlike sony surely these earbuds should be called the mdr-1156 oem ones or something like that but they're not these are simply called link buds and the thinking behind the name is that these buds are designed to merge your offline world with your online world whenever you're using it but anyway that's enough backstory let me explain why the sony link bars are completely different from every other true wireless earbuds on the market today sony has created what i believe to be the world's first open back earbuds the innovative ring driver used inside the link buds are 12 millimeters that's nearly double the size of the drivers used in the wf-1000 xm4s and the xm4s are widely considered to be one of the best anc earbuds you can buy right now and i will tell you how these sound in comparison to the xm4s so stick around for that but think of the link buttons in a way as the opposite of the xm4s you see the xm4s are designed to block out the noise of the world around you with class leading active noise cancelling whereas the link buds are designed to keep you aware of the world around you allowing you to engage in conversations and daily tasks without ever having to take them off and they've even got an official ipx4 rating so a little bit of light rain won't be a problem for the link but and here's a true story on one occasion i jumped in the car i started driving and i was driving for about 15 minutes before i realized i was actually wearing the link butts so based on that experience i'd say sony have done an excellent job at designing the link bars to fit seamlessly into your daily life and sony have described the new link buzz as a marvel of miniaturization and rightly so the link buds are around 50 smaller in volume than the xm4s and approximately 45 lighter and this is precisely what you need with an always-on set of earbuds and that is what sony are calling these always on earbuds but that isn't exactly true because at some point or rather you're going to have to recharge them and when you take them out of your ear they do have wear detect sensors so they will automatically switch off and save power and when you put them back in they will spring to life again but on the topic of power the earbuds themselves have five and a half hours of playback time with the charging case adding an extra 12 hours of power and of course you could double your playback time by using these one at a time as a sort of old-school hands-free headset and if you chuck them in the case for 10 minutes you can get up to an hour and a half of playback if you're in a pinch and the case is also reduced in size by 26 compared to the xm4s case which means it easily passes the cowboy pocket watch pocket test [Music] so this is all sounding good but you're probably wondering what is it actually like to use them well i've been lucky enough to have tested these out for a couple of weeks prior to the launch and i have to say the fit in the ear is unlike anything i've ever tested before sony say they've been analyzing ear shapes ever since the days of the walkman in 1982 and it's this data that they've used to shape the link buzz to sit perfectly in your ear and this must undoubtedly be another world's first i've never seen anything quite like the fit here on the link buzz but check this out there are five different size supports in the box which kind of work like little elastic springs it's up to you to find the right size for your ear and when you eventually find the correct size support it should ping into place inside your ear and if you do decide to get a set of these i do recommend you get a mirror and make sure you find the exact fit for you because this is crucial and once you do get it right the link buds are very comfortable and easy to wear for long durations your ears won't start to sweat or anything like that so my personal opinion on the fit is it's kind of a loose fit because the ring driver is only really being held in by gravity and the shape of your ear with a little bit of support at the top with the elastic spring support thing so because of the loose fit i'd probably not recommend these for any kind of vigorous workouts however with that said they'll be perfect for weightlifting or cycling and stuff like that and to be honest with you i don't think sony had sports in mind for the link buds when they created them i believe these are purpose built for more office environments or work from home environments where you need to be more productive and i say this because sony seemed to have focused quite a bit on the voice call quality so the great thing about the link buzz is you can engage in online meetings whilst being able to clearly hear what's going on in the room around you in your surroundings so if someone starts speaking to you you'll still be able to hear them and that's thanks to the open driver design so when it comes to voice call quality and the mics on board it actually uses a machine learning algorithm that has a database of over 500 million voice patterns and it will use these to enhance your own voice and cancel out the background noise let me know how it's sounding to you and now let's simulate some wind rushing past the earbuds let me know how it's sounding now as if i was outdoors and it was a windy day and now we've got some coffee shop background noise in the background let me know if my voice is still being picked out clearly with that machine learning now when it comes to sound quality and how these compare to the sony xm4s it's actually a different kind of feeling you get from them they have this kind of airy clarity and it's this that shines through as the link buds real strength vocal clarity is impressive and instrumental details and nuances are present especially if you're in a quiet environment but if you're into loud volumes and heavy bass i definitely recommend the xm4s all day with that said i have found a way to make the sony link buzz sound much bassier and much louder but i don't think sony intended them to be used this way so in order to do this if you twist the link buds into your ear in an anti-clockwise motion and kind of lock them in place like that it literally doubles the perceivable base output but the problem is when you do this they're not that secure in your ear anyway that's a little trick that i discovered whilst using these and do you know what really takes the link buys audio to the next level it's the software combined with sony's v1 chip and onboard dac to this day i believe the sony headphone app is the most advanced and best app on any set of earbuds i've ever tried it brings so much to the table for example ldac for high-res audio playback the dse for upscaling compressed audio you've also got pop-up pairing that will work on google devices and you've even got google location services on android devices as well and there's the new adaptive volume feature exclusive to the link buds which will adjust the volume levels on the fly based on your locations and the surrounding noise levels the xm4s do a similar thing but with anc not volume and of course within the app you can adjust the eqs save your own presets or use the built-in presets there's also the speak to chat feature which is particularly handy with these earbuds as soon as you start speaking your music stops and when you stop talking it will switch back on again which is ideal for work environments and you can customize the controls as well and this is really interesting just like any earbuds with touch sensitive controls you can tap the back to play pause and skip but if you hold your finger down you can summon your ai assistant but with the new sony link bars the side of your face actually becomes part of the user interface and this sounds strange but it's true and it really does work and i guess the upside of this is you're not disturbing or dislodging the positioning of the link buds in your ear and you won't hear that horrible tapping noise loudly when you do it so i think it's fair to say the link buds are unique and i do believe they're not just all about working environments and i say this because sony have partnered with microsoft on their microsoft soundscape platform and nintendo with their app store and google store pikmin game and pokemon games so the idea is that the sony link buzz can also be used for augmented reality again linking the offline world with the online world using audio and if this sounds like an interesting topic and you'd like to see a video on it let me know in the comments below and i'll do my best to test out this feature more specifically so at the end of the day can i recommend the sony link buzz to you well the answer is yes if you're an apple android user and you're looking for a lightweight compact pair of earbuds that don't make your ears sweat and you don't need noise cancelling in fact you need the opposite you need to hear what's going on around you all the time and if voice call quality is a priority and when it comes to sound if you prefer clarity over volume and heavy bass then yes i absolutely can recommend the sony link bus so let me know what you guys think of the sony link bytes do you like the name or would you prefer the more old-school name would you choose these over the xm4s let me know in the comments below and if these don't seem like the right earbuds for you you should definitely check out my review on the xm4s especially if you're looking into noise cancelling earbuds and i appreciate you guys for watching this one if you got any kind of value out of this a thumbs up would make my day a subscribe would make my month and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music],Sony Linkbuds original,The link buds are designed to merge to

59,7UvOqJ8Oml0,Sony LinkBuds: What worked (and what didn’t),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UvOqJ8Oml0,Joshua Vergara, all right a ton to talk about with this product i hope you guys stick around because i do have a lot to say i really am into these earbuds so let's uh go ahead and get into it see i'm a bit of an audio addict by that i mean i'm the kind of person that likes to have something playing in the background basically all of the time because of course truly wireless earbuds have been one of the most convenient ways of getting that kind of experience often by like i just showed you having one earbud in so that the other ear is open to whatever is in front or around me but it's not a perfect solution often having even one earbud in your ear feels just intrusive enough to hinder both sides of that experience there are earbuds out there that have tried to mitigate this via things like ambient sound modes basically the microphone funnels sound in while there's an actual physical vent that allows a little bit of air to seep into your ears for further comfort those products might have been a good step in the right direction but usually they're prioritizing active noise cancellation it's more about immersion over integration and their ambient modes just leave something to be desired but for whatever reason sony decided to take on this variant ocean and created earbuds that are all about letting the whole world blend in with whatever you might be listening to the result is a pair of earbuds that have become my go-to every day hey it's joshua vergara what's going on everybody thanks for indulging me on that long intro and these are the sony link buds i'm doing this video in the format of what worked and what didn't so let's get started with the first thing that really worked the design these are really small earbuds right down to the fact that the case that the two buds fit in are just big enough for them but before we even get to the unique looking earbuds themselves uh what struck me about these link buds is the feel of the case there's a particularly noticeable matted feel to everything here one that almost reminds you of like a raw material rather than something that has been smoothed out now while that might not be what is actually being used here it's not far from the truth because sony is actually using recycled automobile materials as much as possible at least in this product which itself is a great thing to see just for the sake of sustainability even the packaging is made of as much bio-friendly material as possible but beyond the materials the design is again quite minimal and easy to have in a pocket or a bag the earbuds are then pulled into their respective spots in here via magnets but one thing to keep in mind is that there's still this little clip on the back so you hear this little click and it allows them to get even more secure one thing to bear in mind however is that the tiny size of the link buds all around could make them a little tough to handle super securely i will admit i actually dropped the case one time while trying to fish it out of my bag which led to the case opening upon impact and the earbud that was inside fumbling out thankfully nothing was damaged but speaking of durability the link buds do have an ipx4 certification which makes them plenty applicable for like workout scenarios and maybe the occasional splash okay this is something that is always contentious in the audio world because when you're dealing with a product that is supposed to go in your ear well let's just say everyone's comfort level is different yes there is a literal hole in the portion that's supposed to sit in your ear and there's a speaker lining that circular area here's a quick throwback from my fellow elder millennials do you remember those cheapo earbuds that we all grew up with that were basically just a tiny plastic speaker sitting in the main outer portion of your ear now that i'm thinking about it the pair i'm picturing might have actually been made by sony as well well this seems to me like the literal evolution of those old earbuds i can see the circular area being the part that people have trouble feeling fully comfortable with i make this joke with basically every earbud video but honestly it's true i think i have the most average ears of all time because i rarely ever have discomfort with earbuds straight out of the box that is also the case with the sony link butts you see the speaker doesn't actually go into your ear canal but rather they sit just before that threshold so that anything can enter from sound to air to further combat that earplug feeling that many earbuds have so to be as secure as possible these wing tips right here are the key it's important to figure out which of these wings will help anchor the link buds best into your ears because otherwise they can fall out pretty easily since they're not being shoved into your ear canal for security so clearly the link buds are meant to prioritize comfort from the airflow that's possible to the spatial awareness because of the nature of their design but when it comes down to it this is the shape that you get in these earbuds and yet no two pairs of ears are or feel the same for now this will just remain a somewhat novel form factor for earbuds and they definitely are super unique but perhaps in the future we're going to see further experimentation by brands like sony and maybe even beyond to find an even more universally comfortable shape for this type of earbud speaking of features though um there are a couple of omissions here that are understandable but i do feel need to be addressed uh and no i'm not talking about active noise cancellation just yet the main thing for me that is missing here is wireless charging for a pair of earbuds that can potentially be perpetually in use keeping the case topped up easily is really convenient unfortunately this tiny case doesn't support wireless charging and has to be charged via the usb-c port back here now to be fair wire charging doesn't seem to take too long the other feature that i know some people really hope for is multi-point connection this is when you can let's say listen to media from your laptop but then if a call comes in on your phone and you answer it the earbud can shift focus automatically and accordingly unfortunately it's not here either but it's not a huge deal for me personally at least pairing is easy given this button that's on the rear of the case and then switching from device to device is just a matter of hitting the link buds in the various bluetooth menus to me that's easy enough but i do understand why people would prefer multipoint to be included okay so we have a unique design clearly employed for the sake of listener comfort i'm getting to the sound quality and the experience of listening to these earbuds but let's talk about their control real quick one issue i know that people have with earbuds is the act of tapping pressing or holding on them because it can actually take away from the comfort for example you can press on an earbud but that pushes it in or shifts it around or pinching a stem can sometimes just make you accidentally remove the earbud well estonia thought about that too because there's a feature here called wide area tap through some sort of sound or vibration detection the earbuds are able to perceive taps around them meaning that the double or triple tap that you would usually do on the surface of the earbud can actually be done on your face right next to the earphone let's say double tap your sideburn to play you'll hear the dun dun when you do the double tap or you can triple tap to do things like trigger a google assistant to read your notifications depending on what controls you set up for either side this is a rather ingenious way of mitigating yet another aspect of potential discomfort and weirdly it's another way that the link buds manage to integrate themselves pretty seamlessly into everyday use seriously the white area tab is really reliable almost so much in fact that the tapping can be done on almost any part of my ear around the earbud it can just trigger it like my earlobe or if i needed to go hands-free and pause the single earbud that i have in i can actually do this i literally do that once in a while but i will say for whatever reason this teeth clicking that i'm doing in order to do those taps it doesn't work as well when both earbuds are in it's something that i can only do when there's only one earbud in on either side but while the wide area tab is a particularly great feature i will admit that just having doubled or triple taps as the methods of control feels a little limited i'm more than happy to have the taps available on the earbud or via wide area but then pressing and holding on the earbud itself i feel should still be available the main reason why i would want this is because there's actually good voice assistant support on here amazon and google assistant can be used with the link buds and in the case of google assistant you can do the double tap and trigger the assistant or you could just say hey g that is all great but i would just prefer to talk to google assistant walkie talkie style via holds like this and then letting go when i'm done because sometimes voice detection can't tell when you stop talking still for what is given here in terms of control google assistant integration is pretty well done i just think a bit more control will have helped here and in general but let's go in and get back to the point of the link buds the fact that they can let the world in with or without anything playing through them as i mentioned before the design of these link buds means way more airflow than any of those vents that we've seen on like the airpods pro or the pixel buds or the galaxy buds live the ear plug feeling is virtually gone resulting in basically let's say 80 to 90 percent of the feeling that there isn't actually anything in my ears which is why in some videos lately you've seen me just leave it in while i'm recording my a-roll when playing media you'll still be able to clearly hear the people around you and actually yourself as well making environmental awareness a huge plus here to be fair some earbuds can actually amplify outside sounds as an alternative and that can be a useful feature but that's digital noise and doesn't address the physical feeling of those earbuds one thing to consider though like with open back headphones those same people that you can hear can probably hear what you're listening to as well not necessarily to the point of them understanding what you're listening to but just enough to make it clear you are listening to something else but with one earbud in and let's say half volume you can actually have the soundtrack of your everyday playing whether it's music playing while you're doing stuff or spoken word content like podcasts that you can focus on but you won't get so lost in as easily speak to chat a feature we've seen in other sony headphones is here as well by detecting that you are talking the link buds will pause so that you can comfortably converse after which it will resume playback after a certain amount of time that you're silent it certainly implemented the best here because of just how the link buds are constructed but as someone that does talk pretty frequently even when things are playing it can get a little bit annoying besides it's easy enough for me to just tap my sideburn or do the teeth click there is a reason why you keep hearing me and my peers say these are most like open back headphones it's because there's no questioning how headphones like that even without the more isolating qualities of closed back or noise cancellation headphones the fact that they can sound really great still the same goes for the link butts because they actually sound really good one point of the spectrum that you'll miss is bumping bass mainly because there isn't actually anything in your ear and rocking the eardrum but the low ends are certainly there confirmed for me by the fact that the deep voices of speakers and my favorite youtube channels and podcasts still resonate really well and even though i focused on the use case of just having one earbud in i've definitely enjoyed having both in from time to time and just listening to music or podcasts while working away the difference with these headphones compared to any other ones i would use here in the office is that i can clearly hear issa from the desk next to me if she needs to grab my attention right but even if the isolated experience of an active noise cancelling pair of headphones might not be there anymore i have to give the link bud some points back for being one of the most comfortable pairs of earbuds i have ever used as the homie thunder e over at board at work said in his video regarding these earbuds active noise cancellation is not a measure of good sound quality the link buds sound great but they're just a different listening experience for some of you that might be a deal breaker because you just want to swim in the sound but i would argue that sony is just taking immersion to a different level one that doesn't have you separate yourself from everything outside of the product but instead just immersing both together and making it so that your digital media doesn't have to take away from your real world interactions and vice versa what sony have achieved here is exactly what the pixel buds and the air pods pro were trying to achieve an audio product that is on the same level as the smart watch that might be on your wrist it might be a bit niche but for someone like me that just likes to have things playing all the time or to have my digital content at the ready the link buds finally give me that use case they're certainly better than the various audio glasses that i have covered on this channel these have better sound quality better battery life they're a bit less intrusive and they are decidedly cheaper at 179 you are paying for a different kind of headphone experience and it's up to you to decide whether or not this rather unique take on earbuds actually fits in your lifestyle if anything we're starting to reach the point where there are now headphones for multiple use case scenarios hear me out here maybe you have active noise cancelling headphones for full isolation in situations like travel maybe you have studio open back headphones for video editing you have a microphone toting pair of cans for gaming and then you have the link buds you have these for all the moments in between and as long as these don't make your unique shape of ear uncomfortable you might actually find yourself being a little bit more like me and having at least one of them in a lot of the time maybe not even playing anything the earbud is just there for those times when you can hit play or maybe you get some sort of call and since the earbud is already there you could just go ahead and tap get into the call and the call quality is going to be pretty good here is your mic test by the way i'm using the samsung galaxy s22 right now in the pro video mode using bluetooth earbud as the mic so when it comes to video calls or audio calls or anything like that of course the quality is going to uh vary because of connections and whatnot but here's a taste of what these earbuds would sound like straight through the microphones to this recording so with the sony link buds going back and forth from digital to life is really easy with the blending of the two actually comfortably possible as well so maybe for the first time we can actually call a product a hearable or at the very least this is definitely the best step toward that potential category of tech that we've seen thus far for more on audio products like the sony link but subscribe to my channel sound off by hitting the like button and by getting into the comments from there i'm going to go ahead and call it on this one

61,PEFUuP3eWCc,Google Pixel Buds Pro Review: Just Get These!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEFUuP3eWCc,Marques Brownlee, [Music] so the pixel buds a series the cheapest ones right now cost 69 nice but the old retired 2020 pixel buds before they stopped being sold were 179 dollars and i really like them i reviewed them i thought they were nice but they did lack active noise cancellation and so they sort of fell a tiny step behind the most premium best wireless earbuds that were out and so i mentioned this at the end of my review this is exactly what i said maybe later they'll do a some next-gen or a more premium pixel buds pro and they'll be 279 and they'll do a noise cancellation and a bigger battery and it turns out well that's exactly what we have here this is pixel buds pro active noise cancellation larger battery except they're only 1.99 and actually if you're cool with any color other than coral they're literally already on sale on amazon for less than the price of the last pixel buds so just to get out of the way right off the top these have nailed it from every single turn from the case to the fit to the sound to the features you probably just close this video right now and just pick up these but don't do that because then you'd ruin the watch time on this video and then that's no fun so how about how about i take you along and i'll show you why these are so good so first of all the case that these come in is basically the same as before which is to say underrated like so many wireless headphones have annoyingly thick or larger cases this is a nice compact clean well-made case sure the white might get a little dirty after a while but it's got this super satisfying magnet to open and close it is ipx2 splash resistant as a case and it has a usbc port at the bottom but also has wireless charging so you can pop it on any qi wireless charger you already have or on the back your phone if it supports power sharing and that's all in a package that fits in the coin pocket in my jeans an all-around absolute win in the case but it's what's inside the case that we're here for and the pixel buds pro have this new shape to them they're mostly a matte black plastic and they have a sort of colored cap at the end that's either fog colored which is what i have it's kind of a light blue or coral a yellowish green or black so just like any other wireless earbuds you pop them out of the case you give them a quarter twist to lock them into your ears and while they don't stick out of my ears too bad like maybe the sony wf-1000xm4s it isn't the lowest profile i've ever seen either it's somewhere in between just a little bit bigger than the last pixel buds but the main difference for me is these don't have the wing tips anymore the wing tips have their upside in the downside the upside is they would absolutely stay locked in my ear much better i could run around and jump and they wouldn't fall out but the tip of it when it was in my ear for more than about an hour or two would create this pressure point that would get more uncomfortable over time and i didn't really like that too much so these don't have that anymore which means they're not quite as locked in my ear but they are more comfortable of course earbuds are different for everybody and when i switch to the larger earbud tips like they really do still stay in my ear fine for walking around normal everyday activities and things like that but yeah that's worth noting honestly i think this is the right move also the buds themselves are ipx4 rated so if you still want to work out in them they're sweat proof but i just probably won't so once it's paired up and these are in your ears there are a lot of different features in here thanks to the pixel buds app but i'm just going to start with the sound you just listen to music how do they sound and i think these sound really really good now i'll spare you the bunch of descriptors and audio file terms that i could use just to tell you basically i really like the sound from these new 11 millimeter drivers once you get a nice seal in your ear you can tell they're really crisp and clear they aren't too shrill or tinny they don't distort very much and the noise cancellation does a great job of getting rid of white noise and there's basically no perceivable bluetooth lag at all when watching videos or gaming there's just two slightly odd things that i noticed one these just have a much stronger bass than the last pixel buds i kind of noted that as a weakness in the previous pixel buds review like they were a little bit weak on the bass not these the bass on these is so much stronger and punchier and just a more full low end that it's a real character highlight like so hip hop music anything with a lot of that lower end frequency sounds really good but in like podcasts or other genres or just things where i don't need all that bass i was looking for an eq to even that out but the pixel buds app doesn't have eq and the pixel phone also doesn't have an eq i actually got a buds firmware update while i was testing these and i thought it was about to add an eq in the sound settings but all it added was this volume eq setting which basically just makes things a little punchier at lower volumes so if you do specifically want to adjust the sound signature of these maybe your phone has eq settings built in some of them do maybe the app you're using for audio has eq settings built in some of them do but yeah pixel buds themselves don't have eq built in yet and neither does a pixel phone but google has thankfully said that there is a full five band eq coming later this year hopefully soon but then the second thing i noticed is these also have a slightly lower overall volume than any other buds i've tested in a while it's not problematically low but i did find myself almost always listening either right below max volume or like two to three notches below the max volume because that was the comfortable listening level usually max volume is way too loud for more than a few seconds of listening on most earbuds but not here it feels like it feels like the bottom 40 of the volume slider is basically useless i can barely hear anything that's that low but yeah i am definitely impressed by how little distortion there is and how clear and thumpy and great it sounds at or near max volume so that's worth noting every pair of noise-cancelling earbuds shall have a transparency mode at least seems like they all should it's like an unwritten rule of these things yeah these are transparency mode built into the pixel buds pro and it's okay it's gonna let in sound from the microphones and pump in your ambient noise so you can hear what's around you but it's not the best i guess airpods are still in a league of their own when it comes to this but i'd rate these transparency mode like a b minus basically it's better than leaving them off but it certainly still sounds muffled and i'm hoping i'm hoping stuff like this gets better in the future i hope they can push firmware updates to also improve transparency mode but the pixel buds real advantage to me is still definitely the software and all the features that are built in i still love having google assistant like a hold away or a tap away anytime i want to ask a question i literally just hold it down and say how tall is the taj mahal it's like a superpower i can just just start opening light shades and turning on smart lamps and things and just yeah assistant everywhere is great and in the pixel buds app in the settings you can customize what a tap and hold on each side does so right now i have the right side hold to trigger the assistant but the left side hole toggles between noise cancellation and transparency mode pretty much every pair of earbuds nowadays also has some sort of touch controls on the outside for your media these are no different it's touch wants to play touch two times to skip forward three times to go back the one thing i couldn't quite get to work as smoothly as i'd like is swiping to change volume these they're just not a big enough surface for me to like reliably get a good swipe in i kept trying to do it but this was like the most inconsistent thing for me basically i just end up like wobbling it around in my ear it works sometimes but again it's not a big surface so what i ended up doing is i just end up reaching in my pocket and blindly like changing the volume on the volume rocker on the phone in my pocket which turned out to actually be totally fine as long as my phone was on me so and there's a bunch of other features too multi-device support so these buds are paired to both my phone and my laptop at the same time and seamlessly switch back and forth as advertised no problem i love that and then they have a find my device feature in case they get lost they have in-ear detection to automatically play and pause when you take them out and put them back in and they even have this ear tip seal check feature which analyzes how well the microphones are actually canceling out sound for you and if it's not working so well it can recommend a different size ear tip to improve the seal it's smart the only thing missing might be the like adaptive sound feature which listens to your environment and then automatically bumps up the volume when your environment gets louder i didn't really use that very much but i noticed it wasn't here so that isn't in the pixel buds pro but it's also apparently coming other than that it's not really missing anything like these have every feature that i'm used to having with earbuds and the cherry on top as they did also with this slightly larger body improve battery life so you're going to get seven hours of actual listening with active noise cancellation on which is far longer than i would ever listen to earbuds that's up to you if you want to do that 11 hours with anc off that's a huge advantage so for 199 should you just get these probably yeah i mean this is easy to recommend there are some other options out there so for around this price you're looking at you could definitely get air pods if you're into that but you can also look towards if you specifically want better sound there are better sounding earbuds but also something like samsung's new buds 2 or pro they're 229. i haven't gotten the chance to hear them yet because they just came out and samsung didn't send me any but i imagine considering how good the previous ones were that those might also be really good and then also as far as like working out in headphones or fit in the ear i still prefer a wing tip in the ear for like actual workout stuff so like beats fit pro beats studio buds those types of things stay in my ear better so worth considering that stuff but as far as like everyday buds you put them in your ear every day you take meetings on them phone calls you walk around with them you just have them on all the time google assistants your super power yeah these are great uh these are the these are the ones i'm gonna put in my backpack and keep around with me everywhere i go well done google thanks for making these please push that eq feature i'm gonna be waiting for it thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace [Music],Pixel Buds Pro,This is pixel buds pro active noise cancellation larger battery except they're only 1.99.They have a new shape to them they're mostly a matte black plastic and they have a sort of colored cap at the end that's either fog colored.The main difference for me is these don't have the wf-1000xm4 rated so if you still want to work out in them they're sweat proof. These new 11 millimeter drivers aren't too shrill or tinny they don't distort very much.The noise cancellation does a great job of getting rid of white noise.There's basically no perceivable bluetooth lag at all when watching videos or gaming. The pixel buds app is great and there's a bunch of other features too multi-device support.You're going to get seven hours of actual listening with active noise cancellation on which is far longer than i would ever listen to earbuds that's up to you.The only thing missing might be the like adaptive sound feature which listens to your environment and then automatically bumps up the volume when your environment gets louder.
62,8urgLV72QU8,Google Pixel Buds Pro Review - 6 Months Later,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urgLV72QU8,6 Months Later," It’s been 6 Months since I bought the  Pixel Buds Pro and since their release,   I’ve found I actually like them more. The  first thing i really like about them is a   feature that was actually missing at launch,  which is EQ settings. Google did a great job   with the layout of the EQ settings, it gives  you the full EQ but in a way that explains   what adjustments you make will actually do and  they have multiple slides for bass and Treble.   Also I find their suggestions of different  sound profiles at the top to be quite helpful. however, a word of warning, there’s  a feature called Volume EQ in the   sound settings that I personally have  found to make the bass sound too muddy   and not tight. The next thing I like about  these buds is their overall sound. I think   they sound pretty good. They've got pretty  clear sound with a nice punchy bass. Now,   if you compare the Pixel Buds Pro to something  like the Sony XM4s or Bose, they sound close,   but the Sony XM4s, which we've reviewed,  in particular, sound noticeably better. They have a wider soundstage than the  Pixel Buds Pro and I’d say a bit of   a warmer sound to them as well. Now, I  know sound can be somewhat subjective,   so if you've listened to the Pixel Buds Pro and or  the Sony WF-1000XM4s, let me know in the comments,   how do you think these buds sound  and how do you think they compare? Now, one category where the Pixel Buds Pro  clearly beats the more expensive set of   earbuds like the Sony XM4s is with their comfort.  They’re noticeably more comfortable than a lot   of buds that have a more in-ear design. This is  because the silicone tips of the Pixel Buds sit   just outside of the ear canal to create a light  seal but they don't go in as far as the XM4s. This does mean, however, for me, their noise  cancellation, while still pretty excellent,   is not best in class. But considering they  retail for a hundred US dollars less than   earbuds that I’d considered to have best in class  noise cancellation, I think the Pixel Buds Pro are   still pretty good. The noise cancellation still  blocks out most things you don't want to hear. These buds, like a lot of the other buds they're  competing against, also do not give you that   plugged ear feeling when you wear them and because  of their noise cancellation, I found they sound   quite a bit better than the less expensive  buds from Google, the Pixel Buds A Series. Another area where the Pixel Buds  Pro really stand out is battery   life. TThey’re rated for 11 hours  of battery life which is a slightly   misleading figure since that’s without  noise cancellation turned on. The buds   only get 7 hours of battery life with noise  cancellation, which is still very respectable. I'm not typically used to saying this phrase,  but Google is absolutely crushing most of the   competition when it comes to the spec.  When you add in the Pixel Buds Pro case,   you get a total of 20 hours of listening  time with active noise cancellation on. So, how exactly do Google manage to be most  of their competition with a battery life spec?  Well, you have to make the year buds weigh  more for the larger battery and you have to   be able to fit that battery into earbuds in a  way that's comfortable. Google was able to do   both of these things while not making these  Buds noticeably more uncomfortable to wear. The Pixel Buds Pro, unlike the Pixel Buds A  Series, do not feature a stabilizer arc in   their design, which I think actually helps make  them potentially more comfortable but might not   fit some people’s ears as well. Another thing  I love about these buds are the music controls   used for them. Unlike most competing buds, not  only can you control the music by playing and   pausing it with taps or cycling through  noise cancellation and transparency mode. But Google also brought back volume controls.  With volume controls on the Pixel Buds Pro, they   do occasionally misfire and instead of swiping  forward for volume up and falling it back all   accidentally play or pause music. Most of the time  the volume swipes do work for me. And honestly i'd   rather just take the misfires than not having the  ability to swipe volume up and down on these buds. So, some other things I've liked about  these buds over the past six months,   are their multi-point audio controls, the Google  Assistant works well on the buds themselves,   though I personally wish the response  time of the assistant was just a bit   faster. One issue I ran into when using  Nest speakers and displays is sometimes   the Google Assistant on the Nest speakers  will still hear the requests that I meant   for the buds and they'll do the same thing like  start playing music which can be a bit annoying. I also like the buds come with a Find My  Device feature and allows you to ring a bud   to try to help you locate it and the range of  these buds is also very good as well as their   connection stability. Which I know some people  had issues with, with previous generations of   the Pixel Buds. With Pixel Buds Pro, I have  had no issues with their connection. The   mic quality of these buds for phone and work  calls I thought was also surprisingly good. Here's an example of how they sound compared  to some other buds I own. Josh: “These are   the Pixel Buds Pro. These are the Pixel  Buds A-Series. And now, we have these   Sony LinkBuds S. And these are the mics for the  Sony WF-1000XM4s. And these are the mics for the   Bose Quiet comfort II. And once again, here's  the Pixel Buds Pro and how their mics sound.” Another thing I love about these buds is  their case, t feels great in your hands   with this matte white finnish, it’s smooth like  a river stone, has a satisfying open and close   mechanism that’s fun to fidget with,  has USB-C for charging as you’d expect,   but unlike the A Series, these buds  come in a water resistant case that   also brings back wireless charging to  a set of Pixel Buds. The Pixel Buds Pro   themselves are also water and sweat resistant. Last few things I like about these buds. First,   they're setup process was  easy and straightforward. And Google did listen to people's feedback when  it came to how confusing firmware updates were   for previous versions of the Pixel Buds. All  right, now let's talk about a few things I   don't like about the Pixel Buds Pro and about  the only downside I've run into with them over   the past six months is their transparency mode,  which you can enable by just pressing and holding   the bud and when you listen to your voice like  'm doing now with transparency mode, it sounds   like i'm a bit underwater, it definitely sounds  like I'm still wearing buds and it's not nearly   the best transparency mode i've heard, which  is really weird considering that i thought   the mics on the Pixel Buds Pro were actually  pretty decent. Another not really downside,   but slight disappointment with these buds is  the spatial audio feature google announced   along with the buds hasn’t rolled out yet and  we’re now 6 months into the life of these buds. All in all, I think if Google could just improve  the sound quality on these buds to be able to   match what Sony is able to do with their XM4s,  these buds would pretty much be near perfect. The only people I don't think these  buds are for, is iPhone users. While   these buds will work with any device that  supports at least bluetooth 4.0 or later,   you have to set them up using an Android device.  Google does not make their Pixel Buds app   available on iOS like competing buds, because  of that it really only makes sense to pick up   these buds if you're primarily and Android user.  The Pixel Buds Pro retail for $199 US dollars,   come in several different colors and I’ve  left purchase links in the description   so you can check out their current price  because you can often find them on sale. If you're looking for what to watch next,  check out some of the other reviews I've done   on earbuds, headphones, and smart speakers and  you can get to all of those reviews by clicking   on the playlist to the right. Hit that thumbs up  button if you like this video and subscribe to   the channel for more reviews, like this one.

64,8QcTmzxDQVE,Pixel Buds Pro Review: I&#39;m Giving up My AirPods!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QcTmzxDQVE,Mark Spurrell, ever since i bought a pair of airpods pro almost like two years ago i've used them as my main pair of earbuds for like every single phone didn't matter if i was using an android or an iphone the airpods pro were the earbuds that i grabbed every single time until now these are a pair of pixel buds pro and as much as i love my air pods i think they're getting replaced with these they are the real deal the last pair of earbuds that google came out with which is the pixel buds a series were also really really good and if you're looking for a pair of wireless earbuds that are on the cheaper side i still recommend them you should at least consider them but they had a few downsides there was no active noise cancellation or no transparency mode it could only charge via that usbc port because there's no wireless charging built in and while they did sound decent they didn't blow my mind or anything the pixel buds pro change almost all of that if you put the two side by side they don't look all that different especially when they're in their charging case but there's a lot of little details here and there that add up to a much different experience the first noticeable change is the addition of these microphone holes on each earbud those are for the new active noise cancellation features that we're going to talk about later they've also removed the little wings on each earbud which at first i was actually a little worried about because without them i thought the buds would fall out of my ears easier but it turns out that that's not the case they've ever so slightly thickened the pixel buds pro so that it stays more in contact with the inside of your ear and the result is an earbud that's not only more secure but it's also more comfortable i do want to make the disclaimer that everyone's ears are different and what's comfortable in my ear might not be comfortable in yours but i found that the pixel buds pro definitely are more comfortable in my ear and when i shook my head like crazy to try and make the earbuds fall out the a series bud fell out long before the pixel buds pro one did there is one downside to this new design i found that if i was doing some strenuous activity like running on a treadmill the pounding of my feet on the treadmill would shake the earbud just enough so the sound would distort a little bit in my ear they never fell out but they do move around a little in there you know what the best thing about bigger earbuds is though they usually fit bigger batteries in them and that has to be what google did because the pixel buds pro has the best battery life in any pair of wireless earbuds that i've ever tested google is claiming 11 hours with the noise cancellation turned off and then seven hours with the cancellation on and that's only what's stored in the earbuds themselves that doesn't include the 20 hours worth of charge that's stored inside the charging case which is now capable of wireless charging heck yes so let's talk about that active noise cancellation each pixel bud pro has three microphones there's two on the outside and then one on the inside of the ear like most noise canceling earbuds they do fantastically with sounds that are fairly even in pitch you know air conditioners fans airplane cabin noise that stuff people talking not so much but that's fairly par for the course the only thing i was a little disappointed with is the transparency mode on the pixel buds pro with it turned on you're supposed to be able to hear things around you as if you didn't have earbuds in your ears but the sound that's projected through is not great there's still a bit of that earplug sound where everything is just a little bit too muffled you can switch between the two modes by tapping and holding one of the earbuds you can actually rebind that so that one of your earbuds will activate the google assistant and then the other one will change the noise cancellation mode but that's not the exciting part the best part for me is that the pixel buds pro have full volume control gesture support and that's something that's either overlooked or done very poorly on most earbuds you just swipe forward or backwards to change the volume and it works perfectly love that they've got a few extra smart features built into like the fact that your music will automatically pause when you take out one of your earbuds and then resume when you put it back in you can also just use one earbud if you want to leave the other one in its case it'll work just fine all right sound quality the pixel buds pro actually have slightly smaller drivers than the a series from 12 millimeters down to 11. what does that mean for sound honestly haven't got a clue i'm not an audiophile but the pixel buds pro do sound a good bit better than the a series do to my ear there's quite a bit more of that low end present in the pixel buds pro especially in bass heavy edm songs but i also think they've scooped the mids a bit too much meaning the treble and bass are exaggerated and then that mid-range is kind of left behind it's all right for certain genres of music but i think these earbuds would benefit a lot from a better eq which is not available in the software right out of the box they do get loud enough at the top end for me but i think they also distort a little up there so maybe keep the volume a bit lower than maxed out i'm usually pretty happy around the 80 to 85 range i think the worst part about the pixel buds pro is the price and it's not even that bad they sell for 200 us dollars which is still 50 cheaper than the airpods pro and are around the same price as samsung's galaxy butts pro it's a solid twice the price of the pixel buds a series though which are still a great pair of wireless earbuds the biggest thing you have to ask yourself is if the active noise cancellation wireless charging and slight bump to sound quality is worth the extra 100 bucks to you if so the pixel buds pro are awesome if not maybe click on this link right here to watch my video on the pixelbuds a series and decide if you want to go that route instead anyway hope you liked the video thanks for watching and as always have a great day,Pixel Buds Pro,The pixel buds pro has the best battery life in any pair of wireless earbuds that i've ever tested google is claiming 11 hours with the noise cancellation turned off and then seven hours with the cancellation on and that's

65,-Nd9L8zy2po,Google Pixel Buds Pro (2023) Review | Worth £199?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nd9L8zy2po,Tech Spurt, so as well as spaffing out two new flagship smartphones and a new watch Google has also massively updated its pixel buds Pro busy buggers got some great new features packed in there like conversation detection and this spangly new color right here to match the beer blue pixel 8 Pro but the pixel buds Pro certainly ain't cheap at £199 anyway I've had these dinky we ear Pebbles lodged in my lug holes for over a week now to see if the Google pixel buds Pro are worth a punt in 2023 here's my full review and for more on the latest and greatest Tech please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications Bell cheers now beyond that gorgeous new color scheme the design of the Google pixel buds Pro hasn't really changed up at all compared with the previous version from last year so thankfully they don't poke too far out of your head and look ridiculous they've got a lovely soft touch finish to them and yeah the lack of ear hooks definitely still gives me minor anxiety at times I feel like these things are going to kind of flop out if I'm moving at PACE if I move my hand head a little bit too quickly but thankfully the fit is nice and stable I've had no issues with them whatsoever you've got a selection of different size silicon tips to fit loles of all different shapes and I found that even if I'm jogging jiggling whatever these things stay firmly planted inside of my head and just to prove the point Mar test I've also found that the pixel buds Pro are comfortable to wear for prolonged periods I've had them stuffed in there for a good 3 4 hours at a stretch and absolutely no a fatigue or whatever going on and like most modern true wireless earbuds they are ipx4 water and sweat resistant now if you got yourself one of Google's smartphones like the pixel 8 or the pixel 8 Pro you'll find that all the settings you need for the pixel buds Pro are tucked away inside of the Bluetooth settings no worries if not though you can always just grab yourself the Google pixel buds app fresh from the Play Store now you've got all the settings you would expect to find squirrel away in here including a find my buds feature you can custom cize the touch controls change up the sound options we've also got a couple of new bits in here fresh for 2023 including the Hein Wellness section you can come to this at any time while you are listening to music and check just to make sure that the volume of your audio isn't set too loud possibly damaging your hearing can also check your exposure over time to see if again there's any lasting damage possibly being caused and as someone who's knacking his hearing from attending too many ravy Dy gravy Shenanigans as a kid it's definitely good to see Google promoting this stuff now if you jump on into more settings this is how you can update the firmware you've got some tips and tricks Shenanigans and you can also Chuck a widget on your smartphone desktop this just allows you to quickly access all of those settings with a simple porke Now setting up the Google pixel buds getting them connected with your Android smartphone is as you would imagine an absolute piece of piss literally just flip open the case and you'll immediately get a little popup say do you want to connect to the pixelbuds pro yes please job done and as usual these pixelbuds Pro can connect to two devices at once so quite handy if you want to flip between your smartphone and your laptop say it's all very smartly handled nice and easy as for the touch controls well no real complaints there either you can resume your music with a quick tap like so and then pause again with another tap you do also have an autop pause feature so just yank out either of the buds and your audio will stop playing and also will enter transparency mode check it back in and everything will go back to as it was stuff like double taping a bud to skip a track works really well you get sound feedback so you know that your Taps are actually being registered and as usual you can swipe forwards in order to raise the volume and swipe backwards in order to lower it again I did find i' occasionally accidentally raiseed the volume a bit when I was just going to pause my music or whatever CU I just slightly brushed it instead of tapping it's an occasional minor Grumble that's it you could also long press either bird in order to jump between the noise cancellation mode and the transparency mode or also to conjure up the old Google assistant or you can just completely avoid the whole Pok and P and shenanigans by using your voice say hey which I will censor out in the video so I don't send all your smart home good he's going mental and in the pixel buds Pro settings you can deactivate those touch controls if you want you've also got some minor customization you can do basically the touch and hold can be customized to either toggle the noise cancellation or talk to the assistant everything else however is set in stone now as well as Conjuring up the Google Assistant with a quick bit of voice action or with a long press of those buds you can also have the assistant pop up and read out any notifications for any apps that you're particularly interested in and this is a particularly handy feature if you find you miss a lot of important notifications because you're on the move you're not glancing at your smartphone every 10 seconds however it can also be very distracting if you get a lot of notifications through constantly interrupting your podcast or whatever you're listening to you can of course knock it off if you find you're not enjoying it one of the more interesting new features here on the Google pixel buds Pro for 2023 is the com convers ation detection feature and what this does is if you start chatting away it will pause whatever you're listening to and activate transparency mode it's a great bit of automation if somebody suddenly pops up and you find yourself embroiled in some unexpected chat and I thought this feature works really well but unfortunately it is a bit cak if you find yourself talking to yourself a lot as I often do just sat in this room by myself all day long even some proper law muttering will trigger that conversation feature and pause whatever you're listening to and if you find you cursed to yourself quite a lot even a brief oh sakes that will set it off and then pause whatever you're listening to so then you'll be angry with the world and also with your buds for interrupting your music but conversation detection also has a built-in Auto resume feature so if it detects that youve stopped talking and there's no other voices happening all around you for about four or 5 seconds then it will auto resume your music your podcast whatever you were listening to before so boring any lengthy awkward pauses in your convers ation it works really well but if there are any other conversations going on around you in like a cafe or some other public setting you will have to manually restart your tunes or whatever and then there's the active noise cancellation and I might be imagining it but I honestly think the ENC has improved here on the Google pixel buds compared with how it was when I first reviewed them last year even in my local Macs thatc managed to dampen down all but the most frantic of Chip and McFlurry fuel kicking sessions from small obnoxiously loud children so I could enjoy my podcast or audio book in relative peace they're also pretty good with traffic Trend sounds Etc but like all other true W earbuds the pixel buds Pro are vanquished by the horrendous squealing of the beoo line that line and there's next to no wind interference as well so quite good on a Gusty day on to the sound quality and the Google pixel buds Pro Sport a pair of 11 mil drivers spaffing audio into your ears you got an equalizer in the Bluetooth set you can mess around with the bass The Trebles the mids and everything if you want to although I found the bass was fairly respectable for a pair of true wireless earbuds though the overall sound wasn't quite as well-rounded or as full bodied as what you get on some other premium Rivals at this sort of price and that's certainly not helped by the fact you still haven't got support for ldac or Apex HD or any of those standard codex I was happy enough listening to music on the pixel buds Pro and audiobooks and podcasts come through nice and crisp and clear as well those vocals really shine but certainly at this sort of price point audio files might want to look elsewhere one of the other fresh new features for the Google pixel buds Pro for 2023 is spatial audio support complete with head tracking I found this works perfectly well in supported content on the likes of YouTube I think it's still kind of a niche feature of course and not the kind of thing that most people would actually bother ever really using or even realizing it existed and the Big G is also promising reduced audio when you're gaming on the ls of genin impact on supported smartphones like the pixel 8 and the pixel 8 Pro I certainly had no complaints in this area it sounded like the audio was perfectly matched with the visuals and the pixel buds Pro are excellent if you actually take a lot of phone calls on your smartphone you've now got Bluetooth super wideband support for those Beam for and mics as long as you have a pixel8 or a pixel 8 pro stuffed in your shorts the color quality is excellent I'm recording this on a pixel 8 Pro and Google has also enhanced the performance with AI noise cancell and smart arery and this is absolutely fine if it's just dealing with l levels of background shind diery occasional bit of traffic etc etc but if that background noise gets really really loud then you will notice that the AI actually starts to muffle your own voice as well as that background stuff and so your voice doesn't come through quite so clear and Google promises seven full hours of playback on these buds before they'll need to be stuffed back inside of the case for a recharge I found the battery life is actually slightly better than the advertised length even with active noise cancellation switched on it it was around half an hour before the battery life even dipped below 100% on the pixel buds Pro app and I found that I got around 7 and 1/2 hours of fullon use before they were finally drained that is better than average for a modern pair of true wireless earbuds and if you knock off thec you'll get an extra couple of hours on top of that as well which is just excellent you'll be able to recharge the pixel buds Pro a couple of times fully by bugging them back in the dinky we case giving you around 30 hours of playback maximum with thec knocked off and around sort of 23 24ish hours with thec on and when the case itself is drained way you can either bung a type-c USB cable in its bottom otherwise it also supports wireless charging so again handy if you've got the likes of the pixel 8 or the pixel 8 Pro with that reverse wireless charging just Chuck it on the back to be able to Power It Up on the move and the case itself hasn't changed up at all compared with last year it's once again pleasingly dinky nice and rounded so easily slips into a pocket of bag or whatever this is very very cute indeed so there you have it my lovies that is the Google pixel buds Pro improved and updated for 2023 and still not my favorite true one ear birds out there especially as they do cost 200 quid they are competing with boses and sonies and the like but if you're sold on those Google Assistant features and you've got yourself a pixel blow you'll certainly be able to get the most out of these things that's what I reckon anyway be gritty your thoughts on the Google pixelbuds pro down below please do pug subscribe and dig that notifications Bell for more on the latest and greatest dech and have yourselves a wonderful rest of the week cheers every war love you,Pixel Buds Pro,Google has massively updated its pixel buds Pro

66,MlwzASBicRY,Google PIXEL BUDS PRO: An Audio Engineers Review,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlwzASBicRY,This is Tech Today, it all started with the original google pixel buds in their weirdly fitting string design that didn't impress much or sell well google followed it up with the pixel buds too which had a far better fitting truly wireless design and some great touch and swipe gestures to interact with it unfortunately many users reported experiencing connectivity and sound dropouts on their pixel buds too resulting in google quietly discontinuing them well as the saying goes third time's a charm right finally google would replace them with a true successor and true competitor to the airpods pro but for android users finally right no we get the pixel buds a series which had the design and fit of the pixel buds too but with all those great swipe features removed from it and no wireless charging well that's not as exciting as what we're all hoping for but at least it came at a lower price of 100 bucks and they actually sounded kind of decent well unfortunately google has fallen far behind what apple has been doing with their multiple versions of airpods and especially the airpods pro until now these are the google pixel buds pro google's latest truly wireless earbuds to compete with apple's airpod pro with features worthy of the pro name wireless charging multi-device support transparency mode active noise cancellation and swipe gestures from the google pixel buds too and of course even better sound than the pixel buds a series right i mean surely they sound better right well it's complicated well good thing that this is an experiential review and comparison of the google pixel buds pro with the pixel buds acers so maybe it's best for you to hear it for yourself make sure to wear headphones or earbuds in both ears to fully experience this video and by the end you should be able to find out which one you should get or if it's worth upgrading to the pixel buds pro from the a series based upon your preference of course if you want to purchase either of these there are links down below in the description to do so and they help support the channel now if you're confused about what makes this video experiential let's find out with this first song where you can hear the comparative differences between each earbud this track is filled with a lot listen for the sub frequencies the high end from the snare and the hi-hat sounds in the mid-range from the sin [Music] so [Music] so now one of the greatest benefits of audio products becoming more high-tech is the ability to make adjustments to retune or adjust their sound over time based on user feedback or a desire to refine the sound sought out by the engineer it's quite similar to how i'll create updated versions of the custom eq's are great for various headphones and earbuds for channel members sometimes i just want to refine it or provide different options with the google pixel buds pro this experience has been interesting and complicated for you and reviewers you see when i initially listened to the google pixel buds pro i actually thought mine were defective i thought surely there's no way the high end sounds this bad why does it sound like a really bad mp3 at the time i just got off a plane so i thought maybe my ears were a bit messed up from the pressure but when i tried out other earbuds and even asked other trusted ears like l heifer reviews the answer is clear the high end sounded awful these were so bad that my custom eq looked insane with the highest frequency slider nearly pumped to max i wondered how any review could say that they sounded good because they seriously sounded defective and despite my opinion that one shouldn't judge the sound of something purely off of a frequency chart the frequency chart referred that something was way off thankfully they do handle eq alright but there's no way i could suggest these for those who care about sound quality unless they use my custom eq or know how to eq themselves to be frank i was really disappointed but something changed with the 2.14 update google changed the tuning of it which actually brought back some of that missing high end this certainly makes a way that you receive reviews from others and even this one a bit more complicated i have no idea if they'll change the sound in the future and if it makes this video outdated so being the curious type i wanted to capture the differences between each firmware version so i bought another pair of google pixelbuds pro with my own money with this one using the old firmware now admittedly it may be a little bit hard to hear the change in the high end or the air of the song depending on what you're listening on but try to listen to the high end where the air the vocals or reverb linger along with the high end from the hi-hat on this song [Music] when are you [Music] did you hear the difference in the high end between them to make it even easier here is a live frequency graph to show you the difference pretty crazy right for the rest of this video we'll use the updated firmware when we compare it with the pixelbuds a series i'll give you more of my thoughts on the sound later on in the video for now i want to present the audio samples to you to form your own opinions before i share mine with you the google pixel buds pro continue their great design language with a clean soft design that i've come to really love the case continues the egg design they compare more to a soothing stone because of how calming and soft it is to hold and rub your fingers across the pro case is a little bit more rotund compared to the a series case but is still easily pocketable it does only come in a white color and it is a bit easy to get a bit dirty so there are some cases from nomad i like to use to add some extra color and protection the buds pro come in four different colors fog lemongrass and i have both the charcoal and coral here they have the same clean disc design of previous versions but the pros gain a little bit more of an advanced look with the added ports on the other side the actual design between the buds do differ quite a bit while each person's ear is different the a series has a more assured feel in the ear with its little wingtip and narrow stem that goes deep into your canal uh you think that sounds awkward get ready for more um uh tip talk the pros on the other hand are quite bulbous in comparison and rely nearly all on the ear tip to hold it in your ear this is similar to the way that the airpods pro work which ends up feeling quite comfortable and at times like there's nothing in your ear and that's normally a great thing unfortunately for my ears in particular whenever i was working out or a mist of water got into my ear and encountered the ipx4 water resistance i could feel the pros slowly slipping out and became an area of concern for me that they just fall out and i'd lose them i did get some comply foam ear tips that do an excellent job of keeping the earbuds in place and added some extra passive noise cancellation but just a heads up though you can really feel these in your ears as it fills up the space and i know some people will find that uncomfortable as for being able to sleep with them in your ears i personally haven't found any ear but that is as comfortable as the pixel buds a for that the pixel buds pro do manage to do better than most and you could manage to fall asleep with them in your ear if you were tired enough but i do still feel a little bit of pressure on my ear when i lay down with them in so yeah you could sleep with them in your ear but i wouldn't prefer to use them while sleeping for this song pay attention to the clarity of the attack on the acoustic guitar strings and how forward the mid-range is on the body of the guitar and vocals the nights get cold sometimes when i look over i see you by a fire with your hands out in the open and i wonder if [Music] i must be singing on my own the pixel buds a series have the typical tap touch interactions for interacting with it to play pause move between tracks and activate the assistant the pros gain the swipe gestures i miss so much from the pixel buds too so they gain a very easy and intuitive way of being able to increase and decrease the volume with a swipe surprisingly not a ton of earbuds offer the ability to change the volume while retaining other features like skipping tracks or activating the assistant so this is very nice to have and i think they work quite well as for connectivity both of them have android quick pair which is nice to have and because of their link with your google account it does make it very easy to pair with other google or android devices just by tapping on the toast notification on your other device this comes in particularly handy for the pros with multipoint as long as you've previously connected to both devices before you can play audio in one device pause it and then start playing audio on the other device seamlessly and for those out there like me that like to use one earbud at a time either to extend battery life or give you less of a congested feeling you can indeed use them one at a time however one thing that i've noticed a number of times when i do end up putting in the second earbud after using one at a time for a bit is that the two earbuds will be slightly off sync giving a bit of that coarse effect as if it's off by milliseconds not great but you can always alleviate that by putting them both in the case and then reconnecting them there's also a button on the back of the case to manually put it into pairing mode in case you need to this is a much better option compared to others and yes that means you can easily connect it to your computer or even an iphone however there is an app for both earbuds but it's only available on android and it may never expand beyond that so that's worth considering both of them have a neat feature called volume eq which follows a fletcher munson curve or equal loudness curves which has to deal with how human ears perceive low and high frequencies at lower volumes compared to higher volumes i talked about a bit in my video about how to eq headphones and earbuds which you can check out in the card up here but essentially it compensates for this unique thing with our ears that makes them sound consistent in sound whether it's at lower or higher volumes they do differ in areas like adaptive sound which adjusts the volumes up and down depending on external sounds and the pixel buds a series also give you the option to adjust the amount of bass you want for this entire video i have it set to plus one which kind of fills it up a little bit more while still being tasteful now for this track it is a very mid-rangey warm and soulful track listen to her vocals electric guitar lines and the keyboard [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] now let's see how the microphones perform in various environments what you sound like on a zoom call on default settings and how it sounds to receive a phone call while doing that and to help financially support videos like these and to provide the value that you're looking for while saving you time i'll test out the mics while telling you about this video's sponsor nordvpn i don't know if you feel the same way i do but it seems like many things that internet are changing a lot and the need for privacy is even more important a vpn is a must and it needs to be fast easy and secure nordvpn is my go-to for that because it's a vpn that isn't slow and is as easy to use with one click i use it for streaming services which are becoming more fragmented daily it seems like shows that used to be on one platform are no longer there unless you're in another country having a vpn makes it easy and makes it appear that you're in another country so you can keep watching that show that they just removed nord not only makes a vpn but also has bundle deals if you add in their nordpass software that's a password manager that helps you easily do what you're supposed to do instead of using fuzzykitty123 for all your

portion of the video here's what the pixel buds a series sound like next to a really loud fan on max speed and with when it blowing on the earbud and this is what the google pixel buds pro sound like when i'm next to you two really loud fans and the wind blowing at my ear yeah that's pretty loud here's what the pixel buds a series sound like in a simulated crowd environment couldn't find a rowdy enough group so we have to simulate here's what the pixel buds pro sound like in a simulated crowd environment here's what an hd phone call would sound like on the google pixel buds a series how do you think it sounds and here is what an hd phone call sounds like on the google pixel buds pro how do you think it sounds here's what the pixel buds a series sound like next to a busy road here's what the pixel buds pro sound like next to a busy road and here's what the pixel buds a series sound like next to a water phone here's what the pixel buds pro sound like next to a water fountain here's what the pixel buds a series sound like if you're getting a car wash and here's what the pixel but pro set like if you're getting a car wash i'm totally not doing this for taxes just kidding i'm totally doing this for taxes this next track is filled with a wide spectrum of frequencies and can really make the mid-range and high-end differences come out quite a bit [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] unfortunately neither of these are great for gaming on pc or mobile and do not offer a low latency mode so you'll experience a bit of a delay in audio i wouldn't suggest them if that is something you care about and honestly no bluetooth option i've tested out even gaming earbuds are sufficient for fps games or other reaction critical games so it's best to find a wired option or headset with a wireless receiver on a pc compared to the five hours you can get on the pixel buds a series the pixel buttons pro coming in an insane 11 hours on one charge and a total of 31 hours when recharging with the case but with ansi off when you turn anc on it's still a phenomenal 7 hours on the earbuds alone and 20 hours when you include the charging case in my practical experience i've accidentally fallen asleep with the pros in my ears and woke up the next morning with it still playing audio with battery to spare so i think they're quite stellar this track is quite revealing on how the mid range is handled between each earbud as well as how it handles some of the higher end for things like symbols and the snare pay attention to see if you hear one of them being a bit harsher than the other [Music] uh [Music] hey [Music] [Applause] google's approach to anc is actually really quite nice in my experience i find that they managed to cancel more the body of a human voice and a white noise from things like fans a bit better than apple airpods pro what you do still hear in a person's voice is more around the cliche honky telephone sounding ranger frequencies but at a reduced level this is in comparison to the airpods pro that have more of an even and natural sound that still comes through but lowers the overall volume across the entire frequency spectrum i do think this does come down to preference on what you prefer and will have a bit more of an in-depth comparison of anc performance where you can actually experience what it's like to wear them and we'll compare it with the galaxy butts 2 pro and the apple airpods pro as well that's one of my insane in-depth reviews and comparisons if it's out by the time you're watching this it'll be up in the card up here or link in the description one area that the pixel buds pro excel in is the reduction of that plugged ear cabin pressure that you typically experience in your ears when you have anc on this is something that my ears are extremely sensitive to in the pixel buds pro they have sensors and ports built into the earbuds that can detect the pressure and reduce it so that you don't feel as much pressure and it really does work i can still feel it but i have to really pay attention to it compared to other earbuds where it's really obvious one thing to note i do notice that the comply ear tips will actually reduce the performance of the anc a little bit which is actually a bit of a surprise as foam ear tips usually have the assumption that they'd block out more sound and that is indeed the case passively but not in the case here where it's matched with google's anc tuning also another little quirk i've noticed that if you put your finger on the ear tip or you don't put it in your ear just right you actually will hear a little bit of a feedback on your earbud that sounds like this kind of quirky and weird i haven't experienced this on any other ear butter headphone alright for this song listen to the low end in the high end from the snare and especially the hi-hat to hear how bright or sharp the high end is [Music] i cannot be going home [Music] one area that isn't so great on the google pixel buds pro is transparency mode it's actually not that bad in terms of how things sound around you but not as good and clear as airpods pro which keeps that high-end air that makes it sound really natural no the issues i particularly run into comes from wind noise and sudden sound when you walk around fast enough have a guess of wind hit you or have a fan blow out your ears you'll hear it blowing up against a microphone like this just walking through this room at a normal pace will be enough for me to hear the wishes of air in my ears just imagine how bad it is while running now to be fair there are many other earbuds that also struggle with this in transparency mode the other issue i have comes from sudden loud sounds i particularly noticed this when working out when i set down my weights the sudden clink is amplified in what feels like is even louder than real life and at a frequency that is especially painful in my ears and to be clear i'm not dropping my weights i'm not even setting down my weights hard so i really make sure to not use transparency mode while working out this is less than ideal for those who work out in a public gym now if someone from google is watching this i imagine they have their limiter tuned to have a very slow attack so the sudden clink of weights is let through at an amplified volume before it has time to process and reduce the volume so it doesn't blow out my ears hopefully this is something that they can address in a future update all right this next track is from my personal friend hannah apparent listen to how dynamic the trek sounds and if you can hear all the layers from the horns and the varus strings and melody percussion instruments and make sure you go follow her at himparrot.com [Music] as an audio engineer i typically avoid talking about how loud a pair of headphones or earbuds can get because most people want to crank things up as loud as possible and end up causing permanent hearing loss as someone that is a strong advocate for protecting the only pair of ears that you have i don't like talking about which one is louder for the google pixel buds pro i'll make an exception because i often find myself thinking that they're too quiet for some pieces of content despite having them turn up to max and specifically on google pixel devices if you're listening to something that is quieter like a part of a tv show or movie a youtube video or a podcast that's particularly quite compared to most you don't have the added headroom for increasing the volume to make it a bit more normal and loud now it's quite interesting because i normally have my earbuds six to eight clicks down from the top depending on the earbud but for these i have them almost always on max for anything that's not music and with that said i'll say that most music should be more than loud enough if they're mixed to typical standards and this may not be as much of an issue if you're using these on another device other than a google pixel my samsung galaxy s2 ultra was louder by notable amount in my tests hey so i forgot to film this initially but another really interesting thing about turning the volume all the way to max on the google pixel buds pro is that it compresses it it'll actually have like a pumping kind of sound when you turn it all the way up [Music] so you actually get a poorer experience or the music sounds worse at max volume so you know it's not really worth it save your ears alright for this song it has a killer bass line on it pay attention that the synth and the vocal reverb [Music] forever [Music] prior to the update i honestly couldn't suggest the google pixel buds pro to anyone that strongly weighs sound quality for their buying decisions since the update though i really haven't changed my mind but there are some caveats do i think they're one of the top choices for sound quality definitely not the first generation of galaxy butts pro and the new galaxy buds 2 pro are significantly better in sound quality the pixel buds pro have a bit too much bass boost that seems to really muddy up the sound a bit and there's a weird spike in the highs where the attack of a snare drum tends to be on heavier rock or metal type songs that can be particularly painful at louder volumes and it pokes out a bit higher than the rest of the frequencies interestingly enough this happens to also be the painful frequency range produced when i set my weights down that i mentioned earlier when i talk about the transparency mode and unfortunately the mid-range also has a kind of papery sound to it that makes it sound really cheap at its default tuning i find that the sound is quite a few steps back compared to the pixel buds a series when you can adjust the bass up on the a series to fill it up a bit more it makes it closer to what the pixel buds pro are trying to do but it manages to have a cleaner and airier high end without an overly congested low end and that is as long as you set the base boost at a moderate level you might go with plus one and plus two at max in terms of what would be less painful to listen to the a series are a much better option now i really want to emphasize that earbuds come down to your personal preference and the wing that you give to various things like sound features and the quality of those features and whatever else that comes into play but if audio is one of your main qualifiers it may be comforting to know that you are able to just eq on the pixel buds pro somewhat with something like wavelet this would allow you to balance out the frequencies around those spikes in the high end so they don't stick out so unevenly while cleaning up the low end and when i do this i actually like the sound quite a bit more than a series the issue is that this process isn't exactly the easiest thing for the average person to explore and wavelet is not without its quirks and limitations again i do have a beginner's guide to eq'ing that you can watch but if you prefer not doing that on your own or wanted tuning based upon my own preferences i have spent a few days putting together a custom eq for channel members if you want to use it all you have to do is hit that little button next to the subscribe button and it does help support the channel and the purchase of earbuds headphones and equipment for videos like this like this extra pair of google pixel butts pro to show the difference between firmware versions how about we listen to how my custom eq sounds compared to the stock tuning this song has a lot of great reverb going so kind of emphasize a bit that vocal forwardness and the airiness let me know what you notice and let me know what you think of the sound in the comments [Music] i need a west coast [Music] that's like [Music] at a price of 199 the pixel buds pro are twice the price of the a series and like most things it is not twice as good but it does come down to your wants or preferences i never want to force my preferences on you but here are some things to consider as you figure out what is the best route for you if you're the type of the person that honestly doesn't care about active noise cancellation transparency mode multi-device support or swipe gestures i'd honestly suggest buying or keeping the pixel buds a series not only are they more comfortable and secure at least for my ears they're also quite a bit cheaper if sound quality is the most important thing for you and you're not the type that knows how to or feels comfortable adjusting the eq on your earbuds then again the pixel buds a series make the most sense now it is possible that google will continue to refine the audio over future firmware updates or maybe the eq feature that soon account will be more than sufficient for adjusting the sound quality but it's really hard for me to suggest something on possibilities in the future so i guess that comes down to your own comfort level also if you are the person that is comfortable adjusting things in wavelet or wants to use my custom eq then the pixel buzz pro can make some sense if you do care about active noise cancellation a lot and want to be in the google ecosystem i think the google pixel buds pro actually do a pretty good job here like i mentioned before its weak spot is how fast it compresses or limits audio and transparency mode so hopefully that can be fixed in a future firmware update and to be fair that's only an issue in one setting mode the area that the pixelbots pros shine the most is the swipe gestures and the battery life if either of those are the main part of your buying decision then the pixel butts pro make a lot of sense now here's another great song that covers a ton of the frequency range let's compare both earbuds and my custom eq [Music] mistake [Music] is [Music] now for those who really want to know my personal preference if i had to choose between the two i would actually pick the google pixel buds pro and that's because i have the ability to adjust the eq to my taste if i couldn't do that i definitely wouldn't use the google pixel buds pro they have to listen to and they have a sound that really bums me out i was hoping for something far better than this especially when their nest speaker was tuned surprisingly well now if i had a choice of any earbud these wouldn't even be considered as an option for me to choose from as there are many other options that sound way better than these trust me i really wanted to like these but the sound really bothers me but if they don't bother you and you're the type of person that would like to buy them you can do so by clicking the link in the description or right here let me know your thoughts on the sound test features and which one is for you or not for you full disclosure google did not send these to me they were purchased with my own money and google has no editorial control of this review and they are seeing it at the same time as you thanks for watching this is tech today until next time,Pixel Buds Pro,The google pixel buds pro is google's latest truly wireless earbuds to compete with apple's airpods pro.These earbuds have features worthy of the pro name wireless charging multi-device support transparency mode active noise cancellation and swipe gestures.This video is an experiential review and comparison of the google pixel buds pro with the pixel buds acers.You should be able to find out which one you should get or if it's worth upgrading to the pixel buds pro from the a series. Google pixel buds pro continue their great design language with a clean soft design that i've come to really love.The pro case is a little bit more rotund compared to the a series case but is still easily pocketable.The two earbuds will be slightly off sync giving a bit of that coarse effect as if it's off by milliseconds not great. The pixel buds have a neat feature called volume eq which follows a fletcher munson curve or equal loudness curves which has to deal with how human ears perceive low and high frequencies at lower volumes compared to higher volumes i talked about how to eq headphones and which you can check out in the card up here but essentially it compensates for this unique thing with our ears that makes them sound consistent in sound whether it's at lower or higher volumes they do differ in areas like adaptive sound which adjusts the volumes up and down depending on external sounds and the pixel buds a series also give you the option to adjust the amount of Google's earbuds come in an insane 11 hours on one charge and a total of 31 hours when recharging with the case.Google's approach to anc is actually really quite nice in my experience.The pixel buds pro excel in is the reduction of that plugged ear cabin pressure. clink is amplified in what feels like is even louder than real life and at a frequency that is especially painful in my ears. galaxy buds 2 pro are significantly better in sound quality the pixel buds pro have a bit too much bass boost that seems to really muddy up the sound a bit. This video shows the difference between the Google pixel buds pro and a series of headphones.The pixel buds pro is cheaper if sound quality is the most important thing for you.It is possible that google will continue to refine the audio over future firmware updates or maybe the eq feature that soon will be more than sufficient for adjusting the sound quality.The pixel buds pro actually do a pretty good job here like i mentioned before its weak spot is how fast it compresses or limits audio and transparency mode.
67,JNa1UMrV5zo,Pixel Buds Pro Review | Best New True Wireless Earbuds?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNa1UMrV5zo,Tech Spurt, so the fresh new pixel buds pro or google's first true wireless earbuds since the excellent pixel buds a series which by the way came out over a year ago now seriously time stop being so  scary all right and with the slightly eye water and asking price of 179 great british pounds these fresh pixel buds pro cost 80 quid more than the a series earbuds and for that extra scratch you get active noise cancellation longer battery life wireless charging and a few extra tasty bonuses now i've had these curvy weed buggers lodged in my lug calls for a good few days now so here's my early google pixel buds pro impressions and for more on the latest and greatest tech please do poke subscribe and hitting that notifications bell cheers so let's start with the design beginning with the case and as with the pixel air series it's like a smooth round pebble just slips effortlessly into any pocket or bag if you do slip it into your jeans pocket or something it won't jut awkwardly into your pancreas and make things a little bit awkward the actual pixel buds pro themselves are also like smooth round pebbles and they are pleasingly dinky so they don't jut right out of your head like some of google's previous efforts they are a lot more subtle in that regard it's a matte surface they don't get all smudgy and greasy or anything like that you got a two-tone finish here as well available in four different colors charcoal fog lemongrass and coral there's no kind of ear hooks on the google pixel buds pro to help keep them stable inside of your head so i was a little bit worried that they would be constantly slipping about you'd have to be constantly adjusting them but thankfully even if you're wearing them while walking at peace they stay lodged neatly in place somehow i don't know physics because i really love you guys i even indulged in a little bit of light jogging to see how they'd fare there and again stayed perfectly in place they didn't go flying off and straight down the nearest drain you've just got to make sure you've got the right size of silicon tip installed you get three different sizes bundled with the pixel buds pro so that shouldn't be a problem you've got a fit test as part of the pixel buds app in case you're not entirely sure anywhere but yeah fit seems absolutely ideal and just to further prove that wash test and the pixel buds pro are super comfortable to wear all day long as well apparently google has built some sort of sensors into these things which can actually monitor the levels of pressure inside your lug holes just to make sure that everything is as comfy as possible and whatever this crazy magic is it seems to do the job because i wear these things for hours at a time with no kind of discomfort that's probably helped along by the fact that i'm not constantly fidgeting with them because they're slipping or anything so no issues there and these things were also ipx4 water and sweat resistant yum so yeah no problems whatsoever if you do want to do a proper bit of jogging or get yourself down the gym now when you first hook up your pixel buds pro to your device well i certainly had no issues with the pairing on any of my android smartphones that i tried it with i did have some problems with the pixel buds pro app which were then prompted to download just to add some extra features and settings and toggles but that was only for the first 24 hours and then it just seemed to magically work absolutely fine so just some early teeth in there pre-release let's just add a whole bunch of extra controls which are pretty standard for true wireless earbuds including the ability to customize the controls tweak the anc level just do that ear tip seal check which i told you about before and a bit of find my device action as well if you have to misplace your pixel buds pro anywhere you've also got the ability to connect to two different devices and swap between them on the fly quite handy if you want to get connected to your laptop as well as your smartphone and i've got to save repair true wireless here but the touch controls here are absolutely excellent just a single tap of either birds will pause your music another tap again will resume it you can double tap in order to skip forward triple tap in order to skip back and sometimes those multiple tap efforts can be a little bit wonky sometimes you'll have to do them a couple of times before it actually registers here on the pixel buds port just works perfectly every single time no learning curve or whatever it's perfectly intuitive you can even change the volume on these two wireless earbuds by swiping forward to raise it swiping backwards to lower it of course that's slightly different to most true wireless earbuds where it's up and down it took me a little while to sort of adjust and also swiping down in these buds seems to raise the volume still uh which resulted in earpiece and shrieking and me going you can also long press on a bud to swap between the anc mode and the transparency mode which is basically the opposite of vnc just pumps in everything into your locals you can hear conversations announcements whatever's going on that's the default setup you can also have it cycled between anc on anc off and transparency or just anc on an anc off or whatever you fancy it's all customizable via the app and if you want to have a bit of a chat with the google assistant well no need to poke or plug these buttons you don't have to touch them at all just use the usual voice activation phrase which i won't say right now just in case it sends your smart home gear going a bit mental and speaking of the assistance you can pop up at any time in your ears and alert you to any notifications that have just freshly appeared on your smartphone as long as it's hibernating of course this can mean constant interruptions when you are enjoying a podcast or an audio book or something while you're out and about or just doing a bit of work but no worries if that sounds bloody awful to you you'd rather just be left completely alone because you can knock it off in the pixel buds pro settings you can also highly customize it so you can have it turned on for certain apps turned off for other apps or only your high priority stuff will be alerted now one of the big upgrades for the google pixel buds pro versus the older ear series is the active noise cancellation that's now built in apparently controlled by a custom google processor la di da it's not adaptive vnc or anything like that it can't boost up and then lower back down depending on what's going on in your environment and it's not one of the best noise cancellation efforts i've tested out in a pair of true wireless earbuds either certainly around this sort of price point a lot of stuff still leaks in just in a dampened state so not quite as ideal as some big rivals from the likes of boars if you are a regular traveler for instance but that said the google pixel buzz pro do do just enough so you can walk down really busy noisy high street and comfortably listen to an audio book or a podcast without having to jack the volume all the way up and thankfully no wind interference either hibbet bizarre so let's have a shift onto the sound quality and the google pixel buds pro do pump some pretty respectable sound and audio into your head unfortunately the codec support is rather limited i was basically on esc the whole time but these things i think they also support spc so there's certainly no ldac action there's no aptx hd any of that good stuff it's a bit of a shame considering the price these buds they ain't exactly cheap i also found that the base output was a little bit soft for my personal taste and it's supposed to get a bit more powerful a bit more beefy as you lower the volume but i gotta say i didn't personally notice any difference that said i did enjoy listening to music here on the pixel buds pro as well as audio books and podcasts the whole range comes through nice and clear no discernable issues and the vocals are really strong as well which again is great news if you are a podcast fan for instance and if you actually want to take a call on these things as well if you indeed actually ever take calls well the good news is that the beamforming mics do a great job of picking up your voice and drowning out a lot of the crap that's going on around you if you are making a call while you're walking down again a busy high street so here's a recording of me just chatting using the google pixel bud microphones and i'm in a fairly quiet studio environment right now so nice and easy for them but let's do the high street test by turning on some really loud obnoxious traffic sounds and those on the go right now right next to my head super super loud so a very busy nice people like a dual carriageway or something actually and as you can hear the mic is still doing a pretty good job of picking up on my voice and last up for this google pixel buds pro review the battery life and google advertises seven hours of use on a single charge before the buds will be completely depleted i finally got just under that advertised amount more like sort of six and a half hours and that is with the active noise cancellation turned on if you knock that off entirely you can add a few extra hours on top of that seven hour torso which is bloody brilliant well above average for a pair of true wireless earbuds even in 2022 and perfect for long journeys except for you know transatlantic extravaganzas as for the case well this doesn't pack the biggest battery in the world it can fully recharge the pixel buds pro close to two times and then the case itself will need a recharge as well but the good news is you've got type c charging down below and also wireless charging which you can you kind of expect at this sort of premium price point i cannot mention again just how much i love this case nice and dinky just feels great in the hand in the pocket and i also love the way it flips open like a lighter like it just it really makes me want to spark up a ciggy and i don't even smoke oh and the case itself is ipx2 water resistant as well so not quite as water resistant as the buds but it can still get a bit moist and that right there in a nutshell is the google pixel buds pro and my thoughts on them just have to use them for a few days as my full-time true wireless earbuds i do really like them even though the anc isn't quite as strong as a lot of rivals the customization's great touch control is fantastic got that dedicated google assistant support brilliant battery life comfortable design yada yada so yeah definitely if you've got the scratch for them and you've got an android smartphone and you love a bit of google you want to give them even more cash i love you google here's all my money then 100 i would say go for it definitely if you've got a bit less money to spend you're not quite so bothered about having the likes of the anc and the battery life isn't so important for you but you got the pixel buds a series which are a lot cheaper instead so what do you guys reckon are you tempted have you actually got some pixel buds poor because they

68,Z3-EoHIAMmo,Do You Hear That? - Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3-EoHIAMmo,ShortCircuit," - Sponsored by Soundcore by Anker, we've got our unboxing of the Liberty 3 Pros. These have a host of improvements over the last generation, starting with la couleur. la couleur? Help me out David, how's my french? How's my- - [David] It's pretty good. - Okay, cool. There's white, purple, silver and black. And obviously I'm going straight for the purple ones. - [David] Good choice! - Everything from comfort to sound quality, to even the packaging. Nice. Seems to have been improved over the last gen. Let's start with what they figure are the top selling points. Their Astria Coaxial Acoustic Architecture 2.0, which doesn't have any more elaboration on the box. But basically there's a Knowles balanced armature driver as well as a 10.6 millimeter dynamic driver in each earphone. There's six microphones. So that's part of their HearID active noise-canceling, which can apparently be adjusted in terms of how much ambient noise it blocks. Personally, I think that's a really good thing because there are times when I want to block just a little bit of my kids being too loud. No, seriously. I use my ANC earphones all the time to not listen to music. You know, but I still want them to be able to talk to me if they're hurt. You know what I mean? Let's go ahead and put on the small ear tips. There are small, medium, large and Chungus, man. Yeah. My ear canals are nowhere near that wide. - [David] Not with that attitude. - I mean, they can be stretched. They can be stretched. We've also got three different si- oh, four difference included sizes of their kind of active wing tip things here. So let's go ahead and, Wow, this is pretty impressive. These were super easy to put on and are really freaking hard to take off. Wow, that's a really good design. I've never seen this before. I like it. They've got a little lock in there. Look at this. It's a little lockie boy in there. Neat right? - [David] Yeah! - Now that we're looking more closely at this, you can see the insertion detection mechanism right here. So that'll be able to tell if it's in your ear or not. There's your charging contact points. So a total of, I believe it's 30 hours, 32 hours of battery life is held in the case. So that'll give you four charges. And then there's 8 hours of rated battery life for the earbuds themselves. I like the style of these. That is a really cool purple in my opinion. One big improvement over last gen is that they are quite a bit smaller and lighter. So they're still not going to be as small and light as something like an AirPods Pro, but the lighter you can make these things, the better pretty much, cause that's really going to help them stay in. Now I think I did get the size of my wings and my ear tips right so we can do a quick shake test. You ready for the shake test David? - [David] Yes. Okay, here we go. I've got to brace myself here. Not bad, not bad. I managed to loosen the right side. So I might actually, I might have asymmetrical ears, might need a slightly bigger earpiece for this one. It feels like it's not quite as snug of a fit, but the left one held really, really well. Good noise isolation. I haven't actually experienced the noise cancellation, so let's go ahead and get it paired to my phone. One cool thing is that they support multipoint connectivity. So you can have two devices connected to them at once. And the case charges either wirelessly or over USB Type-C. This is a pretty cool case, considerably larger still than the AirPods Pro case. But boy, are we ever getting closer. Like I think this looks like it might be earphones pocketable. Let's find out. We're ready? - [David] Oh yeah. Easy. - Yup. Well their previous ones have been quite a bit bigger. I think Soundcore is moving in a really good direction in terms of the size of the case. Alright, let's throw these in pairing mode. I'm assuming that it's pressing this button is what pairs them, but I don't actually know that for sure. I mean, I guess there's always instructions. Hey, look at that. There's my USB-C cable. No wall wart included. Although, I get that with earphones. Open the charging case and they will just automatically go into pairing mode. Oh, alright. Well that's the LED indicator flashlight. Okay, so you can just automatically put it in pairing mode or you can force it. Not bad, I think the active noise canceling is working now. Oh, hey! Is this our restock beanie tube things? - [Nick] Yeah you bet. - Yay! lttstore.com baby. Do we have new colors? - [Nick] You bet. - Nice. Wait. We're not actually doing a pink one are we? - [Nick] Uh, No. We've got replacements if people need them. - Sorry, sorry you guys. If you had your heart set on getting a pink one, that is not going to be a thing. Let's see if I can figure out how to turn the ANC off. Okay. Hi. - [David] Hello. - Yep. That pass-through is working confirmed. So I tried to install it and it basically just said, app not installed, which was self-evident. You won't have this problem because you'll be buying this product after it's available. We are back. And this time the app has been updated on the Play Store. Liberty series, boom. Liberty 3 pro. Here we go. Touch range is highlighted in the blue area. Four gestures. Press, double tap, triple press and long press. Okay. Here's one of the things I really wanted to try out. Oh. Vocal mode, fully transparent. So, If you want to hear like traffic or whatever. So cause you don't want to get hit by a car. I guess you want fully transparent. And then vocal mode is supposed to only let through voices I guess. How you doing David? - [David] I'm doing fantastic. Did you know the average Blue Whale is actually smaller than 16,000 elephants? - 16? How many elephants? - [David] 16,000 elephants. - 16,000 elephants? - [David] So the average Blue Whale is smaller than that. - Smaller than that. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Thank you, that's very helpful. They both sound about the same with voices, but we don't have a lot of ambient noise here to sort of compare their functionality with. Okay. One of the big functions in their software is the HearID test, which will actually test your hearing and then adjust the EQ of the headphones based on that. So, oh man, look at this. I got to click this third button here, 30-40. - [David] Should you try them before doing that and then do it, so you can hear the difference? Or does that not matter? - Oh, I guess that's not a terrible idea. The ear canal test needs to be taken in a noisy environment. Wow. That's really interesting. David, can you say something? - [David] I'm speaking, this is me speaking. - Oh, okay. Yeah. That's working then. They've done a really good job of dialing in the noise cancellation and transparency modes so that your music sounds basically the same. But the flip side of that is that while the AirPods Pro do a good job of sounding more like an open back headphone when you're in transparency mode, these don't. They sound like IEM. So if you like the IEM sound, these are always going to sound like IEMs. Even if pass-through is on. Impressions without LDAC, little hollow sounding, not super rich. It's nice to just have a super easy to use EQ built right into the software. That's more to my liking. Definitely find the highs a little bit, almost too crisp out of the box, but you can turn them down. It's kind of too bad you can't go in and just say, I mean, hey. Yeah, this may be true to what the artist intended. Like nice and flat. You know, once we've compensated for my hearing. But it'd be nice to be able to go in there and say, okay yeah, that's fine, but I'd like to boost this a little bit. Definitely addresses the lack of fullness that I was hearing with the default EQ curve though. Would strongly recommend running the wizard, if you get yourself a pair of these which of course you can do at the link in the video description. Thanks for watching. Thanks to Soundcore by Anker for sponsoring the video. And we'll see you guys in the next one.",Soundcore Liberty 3,"Soundcore's new Liberty 3 Pros have a host of improvements over the last generation.One big improvement over last gen is that they are quite a bit smaller and lighter.The case charges either wirelessly or over USB Type-C.

69,jMonppsA_N8,Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro Review: Here’s The Truth.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMonppsA_N8,Dion Schuddeboom, hello everyone i'm diane boehm and today we're going to be looking at a pair of truly wireless noise canceling and excellent sounding earbuds from soundcore big thank you to soundcore for providing these these are the liberty 3 pros and coming in at 169 they have a lot to offer so without further ado let's get right into the unboxing as i always like to say the unboxing experience is a product's first impression and the liberty 3 pros deliver with sleek packaging lifting the magnetic lid reveals everything neatly laid out first we have the charging case and this has a nice feel in the hand and is actually surprisingly thin and has a very satisfying sliding lid mechanism sitting right above the charging case are the liberty 3 pros themselves featuring a cool futuristic design looking at the different use of materials already i can tell that these are well put together in the middle of the box are a wide selection of ear and wingtips to help you find the best fit possible putting them on the earbuds they click firmly into place and don't feel like they would ever fall off we can now rest the earbuds in the charging case and this looks very nice lastly in the box we get a usb a2 usb-c cable it's always good to see usb-c and we also get a quick start guide and warranty information alright so let's take a closer look at the liberty 3 pros now the liberty 3 pros come in four colors and as you can see i have the black versions here and they feature this rounded almost futuristic design that i think looks quite good on the back here we have a glossy plastic surface with the soundcore logo and this surface also acts for your multi-touch controls so you can for example start and stop your music take or make phone calls and even switch between the anc and transparency modes right on the headphones but more on that later here we will also find one of the many microphones now the liberty 3 pros feature six in total and these all serve to help with noise reduction and then looking at the ear tips you can see we have some metallic accents and not only does this look good by adding a touch of color but of course is also very durable in an area that is very important on the back the earbuds feature a sensor that will detect whether they are in your ear or not and will therefore automatically play or pause your music this is a feature i always look for in a pair of truly wireless earbuds additionally they are water resistant so this means you can wear them out in the rain or say during a workout the earbuds themselves will magnetically sit in the charging case and as you can see the charging case actually features a couple of leds on the inside to illuminate the earbuds which is a nice touch now one thing i especially like about this case is this sliding mechanism it's just so satisfying to open and close and i could literally see myself doing this even if i'm not using the headphones the charging case itself has this very nice matte soft touch finish which i think looks quite sophisticated i especially like the use of minimal branding as you can see we just have a subtle soundcore logo on the top and then we have nothing on the bottom and what they've done is they've actually put all the regulatory information underneath the sliding hinge here which i think is quite smart as that keeps the case looking very clean in terms of the size i would say the charging case while it's not the smallest i've ever seen when you look at the height it is actually quite narrow and this is a really good thing as i find this way the charging case will have a lower profile in your pocket and just make it easier to carry around with you and then on the front we have some leds to indicate power as well as battery life and on the back we have the usb c port and also wireless charging at the bottom to charge the battery and then speaking of battery life uh the individual earbuds will give you eight hours of battery life which is definitely above average which would be around five to six for a pair of anc earbuds and then with the charging case you get a combined total of 32 hours of battery life again above the average of 24. and in my testing i definitely found these battery measurements to hold up listening at around 50 volume with anc on i get around 7 hours of listening time from just the earbuds i would say the battery performance of the liberty 3 pros is absolutely more than enough not only is it better than much of the competition it actually means you don't have to charge them more than once per week with daily use the earbuds pair seamlessly with bluetooth 5.2 and what this means is they can be paired to two devices at once so i like to have mine paired to my iphone as well as my macbook and then i can easily switch between the two throughout the day so what are they like to wear well i would say the earbuds themselves are slightly above average in terms of size but with the added support from the wingtip as well as the wide range of ear tips you actually can get a very comfortable and light feeling fit out of these earbuds now to insert them properly make sure that you first angle them up into the ear and then once they're in you twist them down to sort of lock that rear wing into place and once they are in they are really in during an intense workout these earbuds do not even come close to falling out while at the same time still being comfortable enough to wear several hours throughout the day before i talk about sound i want to talk about one of my favorite features of the liberty 3 pros and that is the built-in active noise cancellation now this can be toggled on and off directly from the earbuds and this is great if say you're waiting in line for your coffee and quickly need to speak to make your order but then want to switch back to turning on the anc all without reaching for your phone or removing your earbuds speaking of the transparency mode i found this to work quite well although it can make voices sound just a little bit robotic it does a very good job at identifying the voices and only letting those through so in that sense is very functional and useful to have when the anc is on it very effectively blocks out more consistent lower frequency noise so things like your car engine plane engine or even the train tracks and then less consistent more higher pitched noise so for example a crying baby will slightly come through but even this is only just now when it comes to anc on headphones and particularly on earphones i find that sometimes as a result of having the anc on you get this pressurized kind of feeling and compared to other anc earphones i found that the liberty 3 pros perform very well in this area causing minimal discomfort and again this makes them easier and more comfortable to wear for longer periods at a time okay but now let's get to what actually matters most and that is how do they sound well the soundcore liberty 3 pros have been endorsed by 20 grammy award-winning audio producers so let's see if they live up to the hype the frequency response goes all the way down from 20 hertz up to 40 kilohertz now this provides a very broad range across all frequencies the earbuds themselves feature soundcourse coaxial dual driver design and what this will provide are exceptional highs and lows and this is reflected in the sound profile which definitely has that v-shape again emphasizing the lower frequencies as well as the higher frequencies and what this creates is a very pleasing and exciting sound profile in my testing i found the liberty 3 pros to perform well with all genres of music but especially stand out with genres that have a little bit more bass so think things like hip hop pop as well as house music the lower frequencies are super tight punchy and deep while at the same time the higher frequencies are very clear and detail rich at the same time the mid-level frequencies remain present now out of the box i would have liked to see these be a bit more emphasized but thankfully this was easy to adjust in the app but i'll get on to that later for a pair of earbuds the sound stage was also surprisingly wide letting you hear and differentiate between all the different instruments in your track and then when it comes to listening to podcasts i was really impressed by how natural and true to life the voices sound and then to top it all off the liberty 3 pros get very loud i found myself comfortable at around 50 volume and this is something i can't say for any other pair of truly wireless earbuds so earlier i mentioned that the liberty 3 pros feature six built-in microphones so how do they perform well during a call test i found it to be clear on both ends i could easily hear the person i'm speaking with and they could clearly hear my voice despite being in some challenging conditions for example walking by a busy street i want to talk a little bit about the app now soundcore has a really fantastic app that allows you to customize your sound as well as other features of the liberty 3 pros for example if say you want a more flat sound profile this is completely possible too in the app you can simply adjust the eq and quickly save and create presets and then to make things easier soundcore also provides a bunch of presets to fit your mood or the kind of music that you're listening to and then there is here id now this was a feature that really took me by surprise what this does is it tests how you hear different frequencies at different volumes and then adjust the eq accordingly now this takes a couple of minutes to complete but in my opinion is absolutely worth it after taking the test myself what this did for me was it emphasized the mids and then slightly toned down the highs and this really made the sound even better i highly recommend trying this feature the app goes even further by letting you customize and fine tune the transparency mode as well as the anc now as someone who loves to customize their tech to really suit my needs and my style this is a feature that i've always missed on some other headphones such as the airpods at the end of the day the liberty 3 pros provide the sound as well as the features of the best of the best for example the airpods pros or the sony xm4s but do so while coming in at a significantly lower price points if you're looking for excellent sound quality that is also customizable anc long battery life water resistance multi-device support and much more for the price the liberty 3 pros are a fantastic choice as always i will leave all of the purchase links down in the description thank you very much for watching guys if you have any questions or comments be sure to leave them down below and i'll see you in the next video thanks for watching,Soundcore

70,JRa9zoktMVw,"5 Months Later, is it still good? Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro Long Term Owner Review!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRa9zoktMVw,Sean Talks Tech, [Music] see that little town called homes [Music] so five months ago we took a look at the soundcore liberty 3 pro and compared it with some of the flagship options out there and if you haven't checked out this video yet you can take a look at them right up here and when we looked at the liberty 3 pro back then i thought it was an absolute solid bit performer and gave it a really good score in terms of performance sound quality anc as well as overall build and design and five months later i have been using them on and off and i also left it on my nightstand to listen to music at night so i'm here to share with you what i think about these earbuds today after using it for a couple of months so the liberty 3 pro steel comes in at around 170 us dollars and prices for its competition such as the bose qc earbuds the sony wf-1000xm4 and the airpods pro are still pretty much the same so in terms of value for money i would say the liberty 3 pro is still a very attractive price earbuds especially for all the features sound quality and anc performance so i have always taught the design of the liberty 3 pro to be really beautiful the case is also well made and the led light inside that shines through the earbuds simply looks fantastic and when reviewing it a couple of months back i felt that it is quite a comfortable earbud i have then also used the earbuds for a couple of more hours throughout the day and i have found out that after an extended period of use probably around three to four hours of use i start to get some ear fatigue and i believe it is because of the shape of the earbuds and how the wing tips presses against your ears that causes the pain so if you take a look at the earbuds here the wingtips kind of stick out quite a bit of course you can change this to different sizes but this is the one that fits me really well but it does press against the inside of my ears when you wear it for short periods of time it's fine but when you wear it for slightly extended periods of hours like three to four hours then it starts to hurt so unfortunately this is also the same case as the sony as well as the bose and the most comfortable of them all is kind of still the airpods pro where you will still get pain after a couple of hours but you can wear them for longer periods compared to all of these different competitions out there and design wise i think these are quite hardy so i personally care for my earbuds and gadgets and you can see even after months of casual use they still look kind of pristine kind of nice and i tried not to toss them around or you know hold it with my dirty hands i must say it really hold up quite well and although my unit was white you can see that it did not turn yellow because i think the material here is a little bit of the pearl white type of finish so it doesn't really change color or this color and the earbuds itself also held up really well you can see that it's still very white and pristine there's no yellow markings around so i think that's pretty nice so my only problem with this is that it doesn't have any aftermarket case that i can put it onto the unit since i'm quite paranoid about my gadgets getting scratched up or dinging so far being careful with it really has paid off but i still don't like living on the edge both my sony wf-1000xm4 as well as the airpods pro permanently lives inside a case so honestly battery life isn't a big issue for me and i think for my personal use case i think they lasted longer than i can honestly use them every day and in my everyday use i don't really use the ldac codec for my usual stream since i used an iphone 12 pro and i have to be realistic that's the phone that i travel with day in and day out so using this earbuds with it i'm pretty much always in the aac codec with the anc turned on i prefer to use anc so i never really turn them off i use them without being too loud since they do get quite loud i mostly use them around 20 30 volume only since i work in quite a quiet environment so six to seven hours of use really isn't much of an issue for me and sometimes i really don't get to use them for such a long stretch at a time as well so realistically i think four or five hours of use definitely not a problem for these earbuds chuck them back into your case and the quick charging will quickly top them up to 100 and i always have a wireless charger on my desk and if i use these earbuds the case will sit on the wireless charger permanently to be topped up so when i move around i grab it and it's always topped up so that's a bonus plus point for me so speaking of volume i think the volume has been consistent i haven't seen any degradation in terms of volume and honestly after burning in the drivers i think they sound actually quite nice and the volume is still really solid so a comfortable listening volume for me is around 20 to 30 percent and pushing it up to 50 is quite loud for me honestly 60 is already too loud for me and i rarely push them so high up so i'm still giving them thumbs up for the volume after so many months so in terms of anc unfortunately i haven't been able to fly with these earbuds yet so that's one thing that i really wanted to test in the future and i still stand by that these earbuds are one of the best in anc performance and i believe if you've tried them with good fitting you definitely can agree with that as well the sony and bose are both really good examples of anc earbuds and to be honest using them for a long time now i would just say that they are all on par and equally as good since either one that you get you're gonna get amazing anc performance so i don't think that one or two percent difference in anc performance really makes a difference one way i love using anc earbuds is when it rains out if your earbuds can knock out 100 of rain noise with some soft music playing that's a testament to how great a pair of anc earbuds that you have and all the sony the bose and the soundcore manages to do that and surprisingly the airpods pro is the only one that cannot really mask off that rain noise but it's pretty darn close so is the sound signature still impressive for the liberty 3 pro and i would say an absolute yes no change to my opinion with the sound signature and it still tums like the first day i unboxed them and to be honest after burning them in i think they are even better sounding so base here is still really powerful and clean giving you a very solid powerful thumb through each beat and after listening it to a while you start to be able to tell the drivers apart because the dynamic driver just pumps out insane amount of power and bass but at the same time the mid and highs are still crisp and clear it's like the two frequencies just don't mind each other and play really well together and that's where this nose ba driver really shines however with my own eq tuning i do notice that some songs will actually get a little ear piercing with higher volumes because i mainly like to tune my earbuds to be a little bit brighter so some songs really does get pushed quite high and gets a little ear piercing but with that happening i'll just lower down the volume so overall i'm still very impressed with the sound quality here with the liberty 3 pro so will i still be buying these earbuds in 2022 and if i am in a market looking for a high performing earbuds below the 200 us dollar range i would definitely say yes but if you can afford the other earbuds like the sony or both of course they all have their own advantages and their own app layer which is fantastic i'll say why not because since they are also very highly rated earbuds both the bose as well as the sony personally i would say that the sound core is really mingling at the same level as those flagship earbuds so definitely give this a go if you haven't so that is it for this long term review if you find this video helpful smash that thumbs up button share this video everywhere and if you haven't yet subscribed do consider subscribing i'll see you in the next video,Soundcore Liberty 3,Five months ago we took a look at the soundcore liberty 3 pro and compared it with some of the flagship options out there.We gave it a really good score in terms of

72,Tc38SeObwDQ,Half A Year Later... Here&#39;s My Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro Review,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc38SeObwDQ,Picky Audio, hey everyone today i'm finally going to be reviewing the soundcore liberty 3 pro and you know sometimes it's worth waiting around because these buds have been updated quite a bit since their initial release so things are a little bit different now but i can definitely say these buds are a banger they're coming in at 269 australian 149 us but they often go on sale quite a bit cheaper so make sure you check the links out below now today these buds are going to get the usual picky treatment we're covering everything and i'm also going to compare them to 14 different true arts earbuds because why not so no time to waste let's get straight into it as usual here we're going in down let's get into another picky review [Music] all right starting with the design here i got them in dusk purple don't really know why i felt like switching it up a little bit i can safely say now that purple probably isn't my color but at least i gave it a go despite whatever color you choose there are four to choose from they all look pretty good this is a nice looking bud there is a lot of bud though it's quite a chunky one so my initial thoughts of the fit weren't very high but as usual my initial impressions are wrong and the fit is actually really good included in the box you're getting four sizes of ear tips and wing tips so you can probably find a size that works for any ear for my giant ears i use the largest wing tip and the second largest ear tips and with this combo the buds slide in nice and smooth no mucking about so nice ergonomics and the actual feel of the ear tips a nice quality so the comfort is really great i normally test my buds mainly when i'm training which is normally over two hours no issues at all with discomfort these are also engineered with a bit of pressure relief so basically this means you don't get that pressure or suction in your ear canal now the security here considering it's quite a chunky bud with the help of that wingtip it's surprisingly good in my training sessions i've used these at least 20 times there's no way the buds are going to fall out of my ears the only issue i ran into was the buds kind of budging out ever so slightly when like making weird training faces setting up for a bench press like moving around a little bit again no way they're going to fall out but the still can be lost a little bit this just means i need a couple of extra readjustments here and there throughout my workouts so overall they're still solid they're not going to be my go-to training bud right now i'm still using the jabra elite 75t and jbl live pro plus but anyway if you like using your earbuds when training these have an ipx4 water resistant rating fine for sweat splash of the water using the rain you just can't submerge the buds in water now with the battery life you're getting an advertised eight hours from the earbuds 32 hours in total with noise cancelling off and six hours from the earbuds 24 hours in total with noise cancelling on and in my battery test on an iphone 10s at 70 volume with noise cancelling at full strength i got 5 hours and 20 minutes so just below the advertised amount there but pretty close you're also getting some pretty solid fast charging here so chuck the buds in the case for 15 minutes you're gonna get three hours of playback on the earbuds which is i think some of the best fast charge i've ever seen and the case can also be charged wirelessly and speaking of the case the actual build of it feels quite hollow it's a little bit light but the sliding mechanism works really great feels nice and smooth it's just taking the buds in and out of the case at first feels incredibly strange it took me like two months to get used to it but i honestly could have just sat down and probably figured it out in like 10 minutes but i just want to suffer for some reason but once you get it you're all good now let's talk about the touch controls i love seeing this with my true wild earbuds you get complete customization of each individual touch control in the app so you can tailor it to whatever you like and you can also include your volume controls in there you even have the option to completely disable each touch function so a good example of this is disabling the single tap because that can be something people don't like using because it's easy to activate a single tap rather than a double tap and you're also getting some inner detection some of the slowest that i've ever seen it def it's 100 the slowest it takes about three seconds for your music to pause or play when you take the earbud in and out of your ear and look three seconds might not sound terrible but normally it's instant with most e-bars even budget earbuds it takes under one second so not a deal breaker but a little bit weird but thankfully if you don't like it you can just turn that off in the app as well now onto connectivity you got the usual spc and aac but the quite rare ldac codec for some high resolution streaming only on android can you do this and test it on my samsung galaxy s10e you're basically going to be getting about a 10 improvement in your streaming quality it's basically going to be closer to what you would get with a wide pair of earbuds so not a massive difference but it's nice to have there just keep in mind it will use a decent amount more battery life and the connection probably won't be as stable as spc or aac now another rare feature you're getting here that just doesn't seem to be on any earbud nowadays is true multi-point connection so yes that means you can connect two devices to the earbuds at the same time so you could basically have your earbuds connected to your phone and your laptop and it's very easy to switch between you have to disconnect or reconnect just pause playback on one device play it on the next it doesn't work 100 seamlessly all the time i've never seen that with any multi-point connection but it works really well and it's great to see it because you never see it on any trials earbuds so nicely done sound cool it's not all good though there's a little mini con here and that's with single earbud use you can use one earbud while the other rest in the case but the earbud that you are using doesn't work in mono mode so you're not going to be hearing both the left and right audio channel in the one earbud so not a deal breaker you still can hear the audio fine it just doesn't work in mono mode which you kind of see nowadays that's kind of a common thing and another slight con here is that there is no low latency mode so this is mainly going to help with gaming if you're watching videos all that kind of stuff there's barely any latency to be seen now here are my detailed latency results on both ios and android generally if you're like looking for real low latency 200 milliseconds around that is about as low as it gets as long as you're below 400 milliseconds or around that for casual games you'll be fine but now let's jump on over to the indoor and outdoor microphone tests all right so here is a microphone test with the soundcore liberty 3 pro currently in a nice quiet environment all right now i've currently got some proud simulation noise playing quite loud off the bookshelf speakers right behind me to give you a rough idea of the ability for these microphones to block out some background noise all right so here we are in the outside world with the soundcore liberty free pro on a nice busy motorway here right now with cars flying past at over 110 kilometers an hour so if you can block out the noise behind me to do well with any noise in the world and now i'm currently using my airpods pro which are known to have some very nice mic quality they're my go-to pair of evas when i'm on phone calls so i wanted to compare them to the airpods to see what the difference was all right before we talk about noise cancelling a quick little drop on my instagram if you want to see updated with behind the scenes action to me my audio ventures link is down below on the noise cancelling and quickly how i test my noise cancelling to keep it nice and even across the board i chuck my soundbar on and play simulation playing train noise and crowd noise and this gives me a good idea of the noise cancelling performance and the soundcore liberty 3 pro in my anc ranking are falling in just behind the quality of the airpods pro there so they work great at blocking out consistent low frequency noises like in my plane noise test it was with the crowd noise so voices and more high frequency noises they didn't do as good of a job as blocking those sounds out as all those buds above there and just keep in mind this anc ranking is for me it's for my ear canals it's for how the buds fit my ears and how the noise cancelling algorithm used on the buds work for me it's going to be different for everyone other reviewers is going to be different so just keep that in mind people so it's not the best noise cancelling but it's definitely up there with the best of the best but there are some pretty cool features here that make up for it the first feature is the here id noise cancelling which basically tailors the noise cancelling performance to your ear canal you run through a quick test and having an on and off i noticed it helped the noise cancelling ever so slightly and with my ranking that's with my here id anc on as well now the second feature which isn't really a feature it's to do with eq shift that's how your sound quality changes with noise cancelling on compared to noise cancelling often normally with noise cancelling on your sound quality is reduced but that's kind of switched here on the liberty 3 pro because with noise cancelling on i have to say they sound a little bit better and this sound quality is going to be the same with transparency mode on as well so with noise cancelling off the bass is increased by about 15 percent and it becomes a bit overly boomy for my liking and the mid-range also falls back ever so slightly it's not a huge change but it's there so an easy fix here is to just never use noise cancelling off so you have to worry about the sound quality changing so what i did was just jump in the control settings and you can choose what you want to activate when switching your ambient controls and i just turned noise cancelling off off so i'm only switching between noise cancelling on and transparency mode now i normally wouldn't want to do this because there are times when i want to have voice cancelling off because i might not be in a noisy environment but thankfully soundcore has a solution with their adaptive noise cancelling so basically how this works is the noise cancelling strength which goes from low medium to high will adjust depending on how noisy the environment is around you and i tested this with my soundbar on and kind of turned the volume up and down and it normally would react pretty fast within to ten seconds of the volume change so it's great if you're like just chilling at home and you don't need strong noise cancelling on the buzz will just automatically adjust it for you which will save battery life but also more importantly reduce that kind of noise cancelling pressure and suction that you can get when the noise canceling is on height and if you don't want to use this you can also just manually have it always on high medium or low so that was cool feature number three and now on to number four we've got wind noise reduction these buds really do have it all basically how that works is whenever the earbuds detect a lot of wind coming through the microphones it'll attempt to reduce that wind noise it's not going to reduce it completely it's probably going to cut it down by about 50 percent like if you're riding really fast on a motorbike or a bike or whatever the wind noise is still going to come in but it is going to cut it down quite a bit i don't ride a bike or a motorbike but i tested it with a blow dryer which is a decent amount of wind and it cut out about 50 of the blow dryer so we've got some really nice features there but a not so great feature is a transparency mode it's not terrible still gets the job done i rated a solid 7.5 out of 10 on my transparency scale with a pair like the airpods pro being about 10 out of 10. so it's not the most natural has a bit of white noise hissing in the background whether you have the full transparency mode on or the vocal mode i found vocal mode kind of amplified voices a little bit better and it can kind of cut out more consistent low frequency sounds but there's not a huge difference between the two modes there and i did find a bit of a bug with the transparency mode it's also happened with noise cancelling i found randomly like one earbud would have noise cancelling or transparency mode on and the other one not have it on as strong but an easy fix just chuck the buzzes in the case take them out and it's all good but now before we talk about sound quality first touching up on volume if you want some loud level listening i've heard people saying these aren't loud enough at 100 they are definitely loud enough there are definitely louder buds out there i rate these about an 8 out of 10 on the loud listening scale but when you're at those high volumes the buzz do retain the same sound quality no issues with distortion and if you're looking for low level listening these bugs easily get my bedtime certification so even if you're on the first three clicks of volume these buds are nice and quiet if you want to listen to some nice low-level music or podcasts before bed which i personally like doing but now under the sound quality itself and i'm going to start by saying thankfully these have an eq customization because right out of the box they sound great but it's kind of just treble and bass very nice treble and bass but the treble does get a little bit too harsh for my liking the bass i really like though i'm giving it a solid 8 out of 10 on my subwoofer scale it's a pretty perfect balance of that deep subwoofer bass tiny bit of boom but it still retains a bit of punch and keep in mind is definitely not a natural bass response these are a bass heavy tuning the mids are also just a little bit too recessed for my liking so instrumentation and vocals can fall behind a little bit right out of the box it's quite a v-shaped tuning basically a lot of bass and treble and recessed mids but instrument separation is pretty solid but it's a sound stage that even with this tuning is the widest i've ever tested in any true lcd bud which also for a bass heavy earbud is very rare it has better sound stage than the airpods pro sennheiser momentum 2 and sony wf xm4 not miles better but they do have a slight edge so overall it's still a great sound but with that great eq customization you have some pretty nice freedom to customize these to your liking you still can't make this sound i would say like a natural or flat sounding earbud even if you bring the bass all the way down in the eq there's still going to be quite a lot of it but you can balance these out quite a bit and with my customization here's what i got i just kind of boost the mids bring down the mid bass ever so slightly and just dial down that treble ever so slightly as well and i must say these sound a lot better at least for my ears you can also save your own presets or use the included presets from soundcore which honestly aren't the best there's also a 3d surround mode which sounds quite strange and you can also run through a here id sound test to optimize the sound quality to how you hear basically uh that also sounded very strange to me but maybe you did a few let me know and to wrap it up they've also got 14 presets from grammy award winning producers and fun fact after i did my eq'ing i played around with the grammy presets and apparently buck snow and i have almost the exact same eq customization so does this mean i'm a grammy producer now i think so anyway back to the sound take everything i mentioned of how they sound out of the box with my eq customization the mids are a lot more forward now you get better vocal clarity better instrument separation but at the same time i've kind of tuned them in a way to try and stick true to the original sound core tuning and i think i've done pretty well with it the only real issue with the tuning here is with the treble it's some of the nicest most sparkly trouble that i've ever tested with great detail but even when bringing it down a bit with my eq customization above 75 80 volume on certain songs that are mastered just with a bit more high end it can still get a little bit harsh a little bit sibilant on vocals and you can just bring the trouble down further if you like but you start to lose a bit of sparkle when you start going below negative two decibels there but now with my eq customization it's tailored to what i like it might not be what you like i can thankfully say these are not the overall best sounding buds that i've tested but they do have the best bass to clarity ratio and if you follow my channel you know i'm all about as much bass as you can get while still retaining as much clarity and the liberty 3 pro easily the new number one just keep in mind there are buds that have more bass buds with better clarity and overall sound quality and i will be comparing these to those 14 earbuds in just a second but first let's run through the generating checklist here are all the results so with edm hip hop and r b very vocal driven music you get great clarity with your vocals here and a nice amount of bass always works well with those genres metal i'm giving it a solid 9.5 out of 10. being a drummer myself this kind of tuning with that nice sparkly treble brings out high hats ride cymbals crashes all that good stuff your double kicks come through with nice presents nice punch and you also get all this with great separation and kind of sticking true to that kind of like live heavy sound which is how i love listening to my middle these are probably my favorite metal earbud right now now that i think of it i'm gonna yes yes they are and this carries over to rock that nice base works really well basically any instrumentation orchestration acoustic guitars female vocals it all comes through with nice presence it's great separation and the sound stage also carries the sound through very well now with hard style trap and dubstep i brought the score down ever so slightly because there are bass ear buds out there and they still give you a decent amount of bass but for example i was in the gym and i normally just crank the earbuds at 100 on some angerfist a bit of hardcore to get me going and it sounds great but i do prefer a pair like the jabra 75t when i'm going for a nice heavy set with as much bass as possible i also brought down cytrans ever so slightly because the bass response here is a little bit over the top so i find a punchier bass response works a little bit better with sidetrans again you can just eq these if you want that kind of sound and they'll sound a lot better because the separation and sound stage here is some of the best and it works great with psytrance and look basically every other genre is going to sound great as long as you like your bass again these are not a balanced earbud you can make them more balanced but still they're bassy but now it's comparison time and i'm going to break this comparison down into three very weirdly named sections section one we've got earbuds with over the top base section two over the top base but not as over the top and section three balance but still a nice amount of bass makes sense moving on so let's start with section one over the top base because these are all buds that if you eq the liberty 3 pro as much as you can at a more bass you're still not going to be able to get the same bass response as these earbuds but you can get pretty close so that's why i'm comparing them here so on pairs like the sound piece h1 the sonic the jbl 230 nc these are all buds with more bass but when it comes to clarity it's an easy win for the liberty 3 pro the jabra elite 75t though come pretty close to the liberty when it comes to clarity they actually have a very similar tuning which is actually quite surprising because you're getting noticeably more bass on the 75t i give that a 9.5 out of 10 on my subscale compared to the 8 out of 10 on the liberty 3. still detail sound stage and instrument separation is better on the liberty 3 but i got to give it to the 75t they come very close and they're quite an old bud and are noticeably cheaper than liberty 3 pro so if you like more crazy over-the-top bass 75t you're probably gonna be the go now on to section two buds with over-the-top bass but not as over the top because these are all buds that have a pretty similar tuning similar amount of bass to the liberty 3. but it's no contest here all the buds there the liberty 3 pro easily sound better overall that was an easy one now onto section 3 the final stage balance but with still a nice amount of bass and starting with the airpods pro the most balanced out of the five there i'm not going to say which one's better i prefer the liberty 3 because i like my bass the airpods pro are just a more flat balanced sound which i know a lot of people like so it really depends on what you like there but for me when i have the airpods in and then i chuck the liberty 3 pro in they just sound way better for me this is kind of similar with the bose quiet comfort buds and galaxy buds pro so those are pairs where your vocal presence and detail is slightly better again more balanced it really depends what you like for me liberty 3 pro win for you it might not be the same now compared to my long time favorite bass to clarity bud the sennheiser momentum 2 things start to get a little bit spicy here because i honestly don't really know what pair i like better after testing these out for months the momentum 2 has a kind of similar v-shape tuning but it is more on the balance side so i wouldn't say the instrument separation or detail is better it's just kind of again it's a slightly different experience i like both buds it kind of depends on how i'm feeling which pair i would like better if i was to only choose one liberty 3 pro yeah now compared to the sony wf xm4 it's much easier to tell the xm4s push out better clarity and detail especially when it comes to vocals but you just can't get the same bass response the liberty hub even if you eq the bass on the sony's as much as you possibly can so just sound quality xm4 bass liberty 3 pro so there you go probably one of my longer sound quality explanations but to wrap it up here it's not just the sound quality and the nice bass heavy sound that make these a great bud it's about how they don't get everything perfect but unlike any butt i've tested everything is solid it's the easy fit the battery life the ldap codec multi-point connection solid noise cancelling great mic quality customisable controls and great sound except for maybe the transparency mode that's the only slight issue but everything else you can't really fault and i can easily say that all the 14 buds that are compared and pretty much any bud that i've tested doesn't hit all these areas as well as liberty 3 pro do so nicely done soundcore for making the best all-rounder true while seabud you can currently get but that wraps it up for today if you do like your bassy buds be sure to check out this video right here but in the meantime stay picky i'll see you in the next video bye now,Soundcore Liberty 3,The soundcore liberty 3 pro are a banger they're coming in at 269 Australian 149 us.The fit is actually really good included in the box you're getting four sizes of ear tips and wing tips.You're getting an advertised eight hours from the earbuds 32 hours in total with noise cancelling off and six hours from the earbuds 24 hours in total with noise cancelling on and in my battery test on an iphone 10s at 70 volume with noise cancelling at full strength. The soundcore liberty 3 pro in my anc ranking are falling in just behind the quality of the airpods pro.There is no low latency mode so this is mainly going to help with gaming if you're watching videos all that kind of stuff.The soundcore liberty 3 pro in my anc ranking are falling in just behind the quality of the airpods pro. With noise cancelling on the liberty 3 pro's sound quality is increased by about 15 percent.Wind noise reduction can reduce wind noise by about 50 percent. Transparent mode can cut out more consistent low frequency sounds.It's not the most natural has a bit of white noise hissing in the background. The liberty 3 earbuds have a v-shaped tuning basically a lot of bass and treble and recessed mids but instrument separation is pretty solid.With that great eq customization they have some pretty nice freedom to customize these to your liking.The only real issue with the tuning here is with the clarity it's some of the nicest most sparkly trouble that i've ever tested. Sound and they'll sound a lot better because the separation and sound stage here is some of the best and it works great with psytrance.Look basically every other genre is going to sound great as long as you like your bass again these are not balanced earbud you can make them more balanced but still they're bassy but now it's comparison time.
73,jIekmSbuEN0,Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro : Earbud Of The Year?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIekmSbuEN0,Gamesky, all right guys so today's video we're going to be checking out the brand new soundcore liberty 3 pros [Music] so yes your inbox today is going to be absolutely slammed with videos on these because they did come out today but this is one of those pairs that a lot of people have been looking forward to and i think that's mainly because the liberty 2 pros has been so good for so long and soundcore pretty much decided to go all in when it comes to the liberty 3 pros in fact i would say that this pair competes with all of the bigger name brands out there and that comes to the noise canceling and the sound that these have so it kind of justifies the reason to why these also have a price bump because these now come in retailing at 169 dollars although i think soundcore is running a deal between now and october 14th where you can pick them up for 149 bucks but all of that info will be in the description but we need to talk about the noise canceling all of the features that these have we need to talk about what comes inside the box and the sound and see if it's worth that 169 dollar price tag so let's go ahead and start with if you are interested in buying these they actually come in four different colors i have the white model and the black version but it also comes in a gray and a purple so i think it's kind of nice that there's some options out there but what makes these very impressive is they're now high-res audio certified because this pair has ldac playback and they've also upgraded the driver in these to an ac aaa 2.0 now this is their custom coaxial dual driver setup and it's using a 10.6 millimeter dynamic driver mixed with a nulls balance armature driver and to kind of dumb that down the dynamic driver is focusing a lot on giving you that really thumping bass and the nulls balance armature driver is focusing more on the mids and the highs so it's trying to bring you really good clarity when it comes to vocalists and a very bright sounding treble to just give you a lively sound overall but we'll talk about that once we get to the sound now as far as anything else these do have bluetooth 5.2 and they also have multi-point connection so you can connect to more than one device at a time and that makes it easy to just switch from one to the other without going into your bluetooth settings and having it forget or switch over to that other device so really before jumping into using these the first thing you're going to want to do is download soundcore's app and that's mainly because it's giving you control over a lot of different things when it comes to noise canceling and also when it comes to the sound in fact the first thing that it has you do is go through a fit test to make sure that you're wearing the right size ear tips and that you have the right size ear wings inside now if you do need to switch these around it does come with four sets of silicone ear tips and it also comes with four different sets of the wing tips as far as anything else that the app does it also allows you to go through a here id test it basically plays tones in your left ear and your right ear to make sure you can hear certain tones and if you can't you kind of let it know and at the end it gives you this personalized eq setting now i will say once i finished mine i felt like the eq option that they gave me was a little too bright but it does let you go through and custom kind of curve it yourself so i felt like the treble was a little too bright and i needed to pull that down but it was still kind of nice that it already kind of had a foundation of what it felt my ears wanted to hear i think they just kind of overdid it a little bit but if you want to you can just leave it in soundcore's signature sound setting which it comes on out of the box there's some other pre-built eq options in and you can just go through and custom eq it yourself so sound quality wise you can pretty much have it sound however you want to the app also allows you to switch around the controls on the earbuds there's also a surround sound feature there's a wind reduction mode so if you're using these in transparency mode or active noise cancelling or whatever maybe you're riding a bike it has the ability to cut out some of that wind also within the app you can turn on or off the wear detection mode because these earbuds do have the smart sensors and then there's also an anc test as well and this was kind of different because it wants you to be in an environment where there's a lot of noise and you start going through this test so that it can kind of customize how much of the sound it needs to block out and this app also has it where it adjusts to whatever environment you're in so if you go from inside to outside or into a restaurant it will kind of gauge all of the things going on and adjust how much noise canceling it actually needs to enforce and the noise canceling on this pair is the first pair that i've seen that's under 200 that competes with the sony and the bose which are closer to 300 i mean it's so close to being on par that i would say the sony mbos is blocking out around 90 i would put these probably at around 85. the ambient mode because there's also different levels of this as well you can just have it in a full mode where it's trying to bring in everything but there's also a vocal mode if you're wanting it to kind of enhance somebody talking that way you don't have to take your earbuds out and you can just carry on a conversation but it also has an enhanced vocal mode which is trying to pull in somebody talking let's say if you're in a classroom and you're wanting to try to focus on what the teacher's saying this one's kind of in beta mode but it works extremely well now if you're looking to use these outdoors they do come in rated at ipx4 which means if it starts to rain or if you sweat heavily or if they get splashed they're gonna be okay but this is not one of those pairs that you can submerge into water now as far as the charging on this pair it does come with a usbc cable but the case on these is also a qi wireless charging case and that's always nice because i don't like plugging cases in i just like to come in drop it on a wireless charger and just have it start charging and speaking of the charging battery life is actually pretty decent on this pair if you just decide to use these with the noise cancelling off you can get around eight hours on the earbuds with around 32 hours using the case but if you decide to use them just with the noise cancelling on you're still going to be able to get around six hours on the earbuds and around 24 hours using the case now i didn't see any information anywhere where these have a fast charge feature but if i do find any info on this i will pin it in the comment section below but moving over to looking at the case itself it is a flat style case if you look at it from the front it kind of looks like a pebble sound core still went with the sliding lid like they did in the liberty 2 pros now on the back you can see a pairing button and then you can also see the usbc input now if you turn these around to look at the front you will see that these have three indicator lights and that way you can kind of gauge how much battery life is left on the case now moving over to looking at the earbuds the earbuds you can tell they spent a lot of time giving a very premium feel and a very premium look everything looks clean and it doesn't stick out as much as the liberty 2 pros did like i said once you get the right ear tips and the ear wings this is one of the most comfortable pairs that i've tried now as far as the controls these do use touch controls and out of the box it didn't have the single tap or the triple tap function allowed so i did have to go into the app and open these up but once i did that i was able to have my play pause skipping my tracks forward going backwards my volume control and also the ability to switch between the noise canceling mode the normal mode or the transparency mode so you can do everything right from the earbuds themself but to do that keep in mind you're going to have to go into the app to open up those other touch functions now as far as using these for phone calls these sound excellent when it comes to phone calls it focuses in on my voice and i feel like it does a very good job of blocking out my surroundings but you guys can be a judge by listening to a test here so here is the mic test using the soundcore liberty 3 pros again i think it picks up my voice extremely well i think it picks up bass tones which a lot of earbuds don't but this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call and so now here's the mic test for the crowd noise being played which you can hear here and so this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call in public so now let's talk about the sound because the sound on these are bold they're boomy they're loud they're bright that's mainly because that's how i want them set up and i think that's the best feature about this pair although the noise cancelling is very good the ability to change these to make them sound pretty much however you want is really crazy because a lot of pairs have eq options and for the most part they may adjust it some it'll either be really dynamic or just really dull but with this pair i was able to adjust things you know in a little bit of a way or a huge way and i could notice the difference every time that i was doing that and like i said i like a dynamic sound i like for things to sound bold but i also like to have clarity and i think a lot of earbuds focus on low end and then you kind of miss out when it comes to vocalists or you're missing out on details because treble is not enhanced in a way to kind of balance out with the bass and i was able to get this with this pair and the sound it again i it could be different depending on what settings you have it on but my settings is a boomy bass with a lot of attention even to sub bass i mean you can have that subwoofer type feel vocalists are pushed forward where if i'm listening to metal and if i decide to switch over to pop or classical or country or whatever the vocalist always is up front it just never gets affected even again if i'm in metal and there's just a lot going on and the treble you have to be careful with the treble on these because they definitely can get harsh after i did the here id test i felt like the treble was just way too high it was really bright so i definitely had to tone that down but once you get that mix i mean you really can have a really nice bright clean treble and because of the surround sound feature you can open these up if you want to but honestly i didn't feel the need to use that because the sound that these had just after i had the settings the way that i wanted still sounded very open it allowed me to have that boomy bass without it feeling closed in i've been using this pair for quite a while and i could see this being my daily driver even over the sony wf-1000xm4s which i already picked over the bose quietcomfort earbuds and to me that's saying a lot because this pair is already a hundred dollars cheaper than those pairs and i don't feel like it's sacrificing anything that those other pairs are giving you to wrap this up i i'm just i'm impressed this this right now could easily be the earbud of the year especially in my book again that may just kind of depend on your sound preference but noise cancelling is up there the sound is up there the features are up there and having a high res audio certified earbud with all of these other things i think earbuds are now stepping up to what headphones have been doing for the longest time but guys that's my video on the brand new soundcore liberty 3 pros thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay tuned for more,Soundcore Liberty 3,The liberty 3 pros are now high-res audio certified and come in four different colors.They come with four sets of silicone ear tips and they also have multi-point connection so you can connect to more than one device at a time.The first thing that you're going to want to do is download soundcore's app and that's mainly because it's giving you control over a lot of different things when it comes to noise canceling.The first thing that it has you do is go through a fit test to make sure that you're wearing the right size ear tips The noise canceling on this pair is the first pair that i've seen that's under 200.If you just decide to use these with the noise cancelling off you can get around eight hours on the earbuds with around 32 hours using the case.If you decide to use them just with the noise cancelling on you're still going to be able to get around six hours on the earbuds and around 24 hours using the case. The sound on these are bold they're boomy they're loud they're bright that's mainly because that's how i want them set up.The noise cancelling is very good the ability to change these to make them sound pretty much however you want is really crazy.This pair is already a hundred cheaper than those pairs and to me that's saying a lot cheaper than those pairs wf-1000xm4s.
74,egBkUTF_-Ww,I&#39;m SICK of Wireless Earbuds - You&#39;re Good with This One - Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 Review,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egBkUTF_-Ww,cheapaudioman, i receive an email almost every day about reviewing some new wireless earbud and i've reviewed maybe six and i've probably had a dozen in here that never even got a video made about them because they were horrible so why am i reviewing another wireless earbud well because this one's pretty spectacular [Music] for my old job i used to travel a ton and was always looking for little travel solutions for charging and i found this cool little square it had a bunch of plug-ins around the side and it had usb charging not only to have usb charging it was quick charging so there was some brains going on inside and it would charge ipads headphones iphones very quickly and it was an anchor product and when i go to buy power strips or charging cables i almost always buy anchor products so what does that have to do with these well sound core is actually anker's top tier headphone and earbud line anker also makes some headphones under the anchor name but they're a lot less expensive i actually purchased three pair of soundcore earbuds before the channel ever started if you go on amazon and you look up soundcore headphones or earbuds there is a lot of reviews i'm talking tens of thousands of reviews on these i bought three pair of soundcore earbuds and i use them all the time i was even at walmart the other day and they have a small section of wireless headphones and they're not bad headphones they're bows they're sonys and guess what was right next to them soundcore which means soundcore is actually stocked and sold by walmart now it's not these i think they're a different model but i think the takeaway here is soundcore is not going anywhere and they are directly competing with bose and sony and i think they're taking a lot of market share away from bose and sony i like to have music with me at all times so if i'm shopping if i'm running errands and really when i'm mowing the lawn i especially want music noise canceling has never really moved the needle for me one way or the other but i always found that it really messed with the sound or it hurt my ears because there's too much pressure noise canceling for me never was i never liked it noise cancelling was never at the top of my priority list when it came to buying earbuds or headphones the irony is that the liberty 2 pro which is this one this video is about the liberty 3 pro this one doesn't have any noise cancelling and i didn't need it when i would mow the lawn it was actually it had good enough passive noise cancelling that i don't really need active noise cancelling so after a year of doing this channel there are specific products that i keep coming back to and i use the most and the irony is that soundcore wireless earbuds are one of the products that i use the most so these liberty pro three i think liberty pro three yeah i think that's right it comes in a little case the case actually slides up like that and then they have little leds inside which is pretty cool and they have leds right there and then the charging ports on the back it's a usbc there's also a pairing button back here so these are it pretty small and they fit right in here just like that and i was excited to get these because i use their older brother quite a bit these are the liberty pro 2s now the liberty pro 2s have a button the liberty pro 3s have touch controls let's talk about that i've had a half dozen products in here that use touch controls to change tracks turn the volume up turn the volume down answer calls hang up on calls and guess what they don't work sometimes they work every time 12 percent of the time they just don't work consistently so i was not thrilled when i learned that this one had touch controls because i like a button buttons rarely fail you can press it in and press it out number one you know when you pressed it number two generally the product knows when you depress something and close the circuit buttons are good buttons work the touch controls on the liberty pro 3 are the best implementation i've ever had there is another earbud that i have in here a wireless earbud that uses touch controls and it's way more expensive and it's unusable i didn't even do the review because it is so bad i would change things when i'd be pulling it out there would be all sorts of different noise cancelling modes i would turn on just by pulling them out of the case one of the coolest things about the liberty 3 pro is they have their own application and in that application you can change what the touch controls do so there's a one press a two press a three press and then a long press but the takeaway with the touch controls on these earbuds is it actually works dual driver technology so these have a balanced armature driver and a dynamic driver and companies can claim oh we have dual driver technology well that doesn't mean anything because i've heard dual driver i've heard 10 driver iems or earbuds that sound like garbage so it doesn't matter even though it has two drivers in here number one it doesn't mean they're balanced it doesn't mean they're combined properly and doesn't mean it's going to sound good so just because this has dual driver tech doesn't mean they're going to sound good the good news is it sounds pretty good one of the things about soundcore products is they don't really care about codex until now they have ldac and aac which means if you have a recent android phone you may be able to hook up ldac ldac is the bluetooth codec that can transfer the most amount of data does that actually translate into better music yeah it depends also has aac which is good because aac is what the apple platform uses for a bluetooth codec also has sbc spc is the catch-all bluetooth codec to me used to be pretty important however as i thought about things and as i enjoyed music on the previous generation sound core products which didn't have any fancy codecs i discovered that i was enjoying the music a lot and i think the reason why is it's kind of like listening to high-res music in the car 24-192 perfect recording perfect mastering the highest resolution you can get you're driving down the road with 65 db of road noise it doesn't matter how much detail you're actually hearing because you're not going to hear any detail because you have 65 db of road noise going on the opposite is true with iems if you have a driver that is five millimeters from your eardrum chances are you're going to hear a lot of detail even if it's an mp3 so you're probably going to hear more detail through a lossy codec or even a bad recording because it's so close to your ear add on top of that some really decent noise canceling and one is hearing a ton of detail and i would argue you're going to hear more detail out of a 170 dollar pair of wireless noise canceling iems than you probably will out of a 20 thousand dollar system that is just perfect because there's room stuff there's always stuff going on but there's not a lot of stuff going on when you have the driver a quarter inch from your eardrum while i'm happy this includes ldac and aac for bluetooth codecs i don't really think it matters all that much because i was really enjoying the music from the soundcore p3s and the liberty pro twos and they didn't have any fancy codecs something else that's cool about the liberty pro 3s they have an application it's a really good application within that application they have a hearing test you go through and you just listen get in a quiet room you listen and then you just do the hearing test and then it throws out an eq curve depending upon how you scored on the hearing test there are other products out there including android i think most androids you can do a hearing test and it will do something similar it'll spit out an eq curve for you i've tried that on multiple products including the android operating system and some much more expensive wireless iems never really worked out soundcore did a very good job with this hearing test it wasn't what i ended up with for my final eq but it was way better than other automated eq building programs and i think for a lot of people they're gonna enjoy that sound signature speaking of eq you can do your own eq you can save a bunch of eq profiles that you do yourself or you can go through their pre-set eqs and if you go to rock or r b and it's something that you will like but you want to tweak it a little bit you can go into custom and you can build upon their pre-built eqs to build something that is just right for you wireless earbuds for the most part now all have eq applications and it's good because you can get them to sound just about any way you want to and since this has a good driver that has actual clarity even if you warm these up a bit you're still going to hear a lot of detail again this isn't a feature that really moves the needle for me at all but what i will say is the noise canceling on these is very good when i say very good i mean it's not too heavy handed and when i say not too heavy handed i mean it's not putting pressure on my eardrum there is some type of technology in here that actually has some pressure equalization so you're not going to get that push on your eardrums that i hate so much the noise canceling works and it works better than any of the other wireless earbuds i've had that have noise cancelling the charge lasts a long time 32 hours if you're an adult just plug them in every now and again 32 hours unless you're trekking through the amazon rainforest looking for coronado's gold you're not going to need 32 hours of charging even if you wore them eight hours a day in the amazon you can still get four days out of them charging's fine you can plug them in for 15 minutes you'll get three hours of charge does it really matter if you get 20 plus hours of operation out of a wireless iem or earbud does it really matter if you're really concerned about it don't be 32 hours but just be an adult and plug them in at night so this is just like the apple earpods i know they're not called earpods i like to call them the earpods just like the apple earpods you plug them into here the case actually charges the earbuds and then you charge the case calls are good calls are great it's very good they have good microphones in here when i called some folks on here they were surprised i was talking on a wireless earbud so the calls is good if not great in ac and i mean a sea of wireless earbuds from klipsch jbl sony sennheiser just about everybody everybody and then there's offshoot brands that are trying to get into this market everybody has a wireless earbud and it's kind of surprising that a power strip company comes out with a wireless earbud and wireless headphone line that is just destroying all of the established players because these are spectacular they sound as good as some wired iems with a decent dongle deck and with the freedom to tweak the sound signature how you want in many cases these are going to be better than wired iems i know that's heresy oh my goodness but they are if i'm pressed for time i'm grabbing these movies i watched youtube on these all the time i listen to music all the time sometimes i listen to music for pure enjoyment not just background not just while i'm shopping they're that good the detail is incredible out of the box sound signature is now good it used to be really heavy-handed really bassy and i'd have to really bring down the bass quite a bit to get these where i want them to be they could be a little bit sibilant but even the flat sound signature on these is way better than the previous generation but the stock sound signature doesn't really matter because you can tweak it however you want to some people are going to say that wired iems are going to be better and in some cases they are going to be better in a lot of cases they're probably going to be better i don't know even at this price if you're going to get a wired iem that sounds better maybe with a dongle deck but by the time you add a dongle deck probably going to be around the same price point but it doesn't matter even if you have a wired iem and a good dongle deck that is cheaper and it's 25 better 35 percent better even if a product doesn't quite sound as good as something else if i use it more it's the right product for me if you need wireless earbuds for any reason i would take a hard look at the liberty pro threes because they are the best wireless earbuds that i've heard so if you want to support the channel you can sign up for

75,LcI6F_GPwfE,AirPods 3 Review: Easy Mode!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcI6F_GPwfE,Marques Brownlee, [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here okay so i'm in the last stages of my macbook pro review a lot of you been asking where it is i'm not rushing it it is not early so sorry about that but uh my final bits of testing include editing a full mkbhd video shot in red code raw on the 16-inch m1 max macbook pro that's this video so if you're seeing this then that means at some point i got through that whole process so hopefully that went well if it didn't go well then check my twitter because that's probably where i was complaining about how things went uh either way that's next up until then these are the most popular headphones on earth these are airpods so the newest update you're looking at here is airpods 3. they were a quieter announcement at last month's apple event but they're 179 and honestly the story with these is well there's quite a bit of new stuff but also the competitive landscape for earbuds has been heating up for years and there have never been more high quality alternatives to airpods than there are right now so the new airpods 3 design basically looks just like a set of airpods pro but without the silicon tips like someone chopped them off it's a the one size fits all hard tip from the air pods of the past and this is simultaneously its biggest advantage and its biggest downside for people like me see the shape is just slightly adjusted from previous hard-tipped airpods you can see it's more of a wedge shape where it goes into your ear it's a slightly bigger opening at the end and it's a bit more of a larger bulb but basically the idea is that it's pretty close to the common ear and it just pops in and sits there no problem at least it's supposed to for most people but for me again it's not the best fit the left one happens to stay in pretty well but then the right ones constantly feeling like it's slowly sliding out of my ear and eventually it just falls out if i'm not constantly adjusting it so it's pretty annoying clearly not for me and for that reason i still prefer silicon tips instead of hard plastic i am super jealous of all you people who just grab air pods and just put them in your ears and they just stay forever and just run around um i'm not one of those people oh well but i did test these for a little bit and there are some other new things aside from just the new design so there's the controls on the stem now on both sides like airpods pro you pretty quickly get used to squeezing it to play and pause you can double tap to go to the next song etc there's no noise cancellation in these but you can see the mesh cutout on the back and around all the mics all around this thing for adaptive eq it passes through some of the sound from the outside mainly to feel a bit more open than some other earbuds they are sweat and water resistant now so if you want to work out in them you might have already done it but they'll officially be fine now and also if you walk around in the rain no problem and there's also a new horizontal case looks just like the airpods pro case but it's a little bit smaller and for the first time the case is also officially ipx4 water resistant so like they might have survived water in the past but it's officially official now still lightning at the bottom unfortunately but this new case is now improved it'll still do wireless charging but it's also now magsafe compatible which just means it'll snap onto the iphone's magsafe charging puck and it holds pretty well there too this magsafe wireless charging case isn't unique to airpods 3 though by the way they quietly also updated the airpods pro case to also snap onto the magnets but they didn't also update it for water resistance so small difference what would have been even cooler is if you could trickle charge them via the qi charging on the back of the iphone since they're both qi charging it would have been the sickest like little ecosystem plug they could have called it reverse mag safe charging but there they don't talk to each other like that it needs some extra hardware to reverse wireless charge iphones don't have that so that's not a real feature in this product like it is with some other phones and their earbuds now if you decide to grab the sexiest case on earth the dbrand icons case or pretty much any other airpods case no magnetic snapping but yes wireless charging does still work if you're wondering i'll have a link below to this case if you want to protect your headphones and make sure you get an airpods 3k specifically because like i said airpods pro cases are slightly different dimensions they won't quite fit but really the most interesting change to airpods honestly is the sound they have a and i can't believe i'm saying this a perfectly respectable sound now so it's legitimately very improved i've trashed on airpods in the past as you guys have probably remembered for how weak they sound how tiny they've been these airpods when they're sat right in your ears have much more body and bass frequencies now and they get plenty loud as always and they really do sound pretty solid now the caveat is one there is no eq built in like a lot of other headphones have and two these were meant to still be good basic everyday headphones and so apple has tuned them as such meaning they've got to be usable for phone calls and podcasts which have a lot of high focus on vocal frequencies but also music listening in a variety of genres and then also movie watching and everything in between but one feature that sort of gets highlighted at least every time apple talks about these headphones is spatial audio now i don't typically use spatial audio very much but every time i try these i give them another shot and basically there are two types of spatial audio experiences so one is if you're just listening to music or watching a video and you can just force it on with the ios settings and the head tracking turns on and for most mixes it basically sounds like you're suddenly in a small room with a set of speakers in front of you and as you turn your head from left to right those speakers will sound like they continue to stay in front of you but then two there's a very small number of really well done mixes in dolby atmos and you can find some on apple music they actually do a great job of separating the instruments and the channels and sort of spreading them out around you and this whole symphony with a decent sound stage and the airpods do a good job of letting you kind of place the instruments and vocals around you in space around your head but i find that to be a pretty rare experience if you get to listen to these listen to uh blessings by big sean that's one really good example but again these types of tracks are few and far between but ultimately the sound for me comes down to the hard tipped plastic they do sound much much better but unfortunately i have one of the cursed ears that doesn't work with hard-tipped earbuds so i would take silicon tipped earbuds every single time some people are the total other way around so there's a lot of people comparing airpods pro with airpods 3. i would personally pay the extra money for airpods pro also right now if you check on amazon airpods pro have been like 190 bucks for a while and this is the new version too with the updated case so it's like 10 extra dollars to get the noise cancellation and the silicon tips i'm picking that every single time but for some people who don't care about that type of thing this is what they'll pick but that's really the summary for these headphones they don't really do any one thing amazingly meaning they'll get beat in certain single categories but they do everything you'd want headphones to do daily very well they have a slightly longer but totally reasonable six hour battery life they have an all-around good tune that's not adjustable they have a small case that wireless charges and they fit great in the iphone's ecosystem they instantly pair with the rest of your icloud devices and seamlessly switch between them and they have better find my ability now so if you lose the case which i don't know how many people lose just the case but if you do you can use find my to track that down it's not nearly as super precise as air tags but it's very convenient to get a notification on your iphone if you start to leave somewhere and you realize you left your airpods behind but look at the whole rest of the landscape it's way more diverse and interesting now beats fit pro just came out today these have the best in-ear fit of any earbud i've ever worn wing tip for the win they're amazing for working out they have noise cancellation but they have a kind of a still clunky case that also doesn't have wireless charging or check these these are the sony wf-1000xm4 these also blow the airpods out of the water in terms of sound quality but if you've ever worn these i mean they're much bigger and don't really sit in the ear as comfortably and you wouldn't work out in these and they're 250 dollars so they're in a different price category there's also the nothing earbuds that i reviewed which have a better battery life but also a pretty big case that does wireless charge and it's a more interesting distinctive design especially with the buzz that i really like but they don't fit as well in the ios ecosystem and then there's also samsung's buds too which have a lot of the same stuff and wireless charging but you get the idea there's a lot out there so air pods are meant to sit right in the middle of the road like that's they don't do any of the things amazingly in any one category but they do everything pretty well and that's what makes them so easy to recommend it's also they came out right before the holiday season like they know i i'm probably gonna end up getting these as a gift for some people they're incredibly popular for that exact reason but here's a fun fact airpods if you just cut off airpods from apple and just made it its own separate company airpods inc that company would be worth about 175 billion dollars that's from an estimate from back in 2019 just looking at how many they're selling approaching 100 million units tons of revenue obviously but can you imagine just a headphone company by itself with only like three models being worth 175 billion dollars like just for some context logitech which makes lots of headphones but also plenty of other accessories is worth 14 billion dollars sony which makes headphones but a ton of other stuff they make movies they make the playstation they make phones and cameras sony's worth like 150 billion dollars tops right now so that's that's not to say these headphones are amazing but that's to say they are probably the best lure to bring people into the iphone ecosystem and they're all around extremely convenient they're the easy choice so there you have it thanks for watching hopefully the macbook pro isn't exploding exporting this video catch you guys soon with that review but until the next one it's techvember that doesn't roll off the tongue as well see you guys next video peace,AirPods 3,The new airpods 3 design basically looks just like a set of airpods pro but without the silicon tips like someone chopped them off it's a the one size fits all hard tip from the air pods of the past.There's no noise cancellation in these but you can see the mesh cutout on the back and around all the mics all around this thing for adaptive eq.There's also a new horizontal case looks just like the airpods pro case but it's a little bit smaller and for the first time the case is also officially ipx4 water resistant. The most interesting change to airpods honestly is the sound they have.There is no eq built in like a lot of other headphones have.The airpods do a good job of letting you kind of place the instruments and vocals around you in space around your head. Beats fit pro just came out today these have the best in-ear fit of any earbud i've ever worn wing tip for the win.They have noise cancellation but they have a kind of a still clunky case that also doesn't have wireless charging.They instantly pair with the rest of your icloud devices and seamlessly switch between them.
77,TGrZzQ3fcpY,AirPods 3 Review: AMAZING Earbuds With One Small Problem...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGrZzQ3fcpY,Mark Spurrell, i'm predicting that this is going to be a fairly short video because when it comes to air pods 3 i don't have a lot to complain about and when i don't have a lot to complain about i don't rant nearly as much and then the length of my videos gets just cut in half in other more positive words i really like these they are a solid addition to apple's lineup and despite one small problem that we'll get into later on they are an excellent set of wireless earbuds on the outside the case for the airpods 3 looks very similar to what you'd find with the airpods pro it's slightly less wide and a little bit taller but other than that they look pretty much identical same position for the charging light same pairing button on the back and same lightning port on the bottom hidden within the airpods 3 case is a feature that airpods pro didn't originally have though magsafe compatibility up until earlier this year airpods pro had a wireless charging case but it didn't magnetically snap to magsafe accessories like the new airpods 3 case does i really don't want this to be a full video comparing the airpods 3 to the airpods pro though maybe i'll make another one later on if you guys are interested in that but i do want to draw one more comparison here the airpods 3 just looked like apple took the airpods pro chopped off these silicone ear tips and then called it a day they look very very similar to the point where i don't think you could tell the difference between someone wearing airpods 3 versus someone wearing airpods pro much more importantly though the airpods 3 are extremely comfortable like they nailed the in-ear comfort of these things i'll be the first to admit that the previous iterations of regular airpods didn't fit very well and i didn't really like them for that reason but these are much better i've spent several hours walking around with them in and they've never fallen out either they don't feel quite as secure as earbuds that actually have those silicone tips that the airpods pro have but they're definitely comfortable battery life is better this year too apple's claiming that the buds are going to give you between five and six ish hours of listening time and the case will give you another 18 or 19 hours of use since it has internal batteries i'd say that's fairly accurate it's only been about a week since i've got them so i'll have a little bit of a better picture once i use them more but battery life has been great so far to control these earbuds i have to again bring up the airpods pro they have the exact same pinch enabled control panel at the bottom of each earbud it's decent but just like airpods pro there's no way to control your volume from your earbuds unless you ask siri which is weird thankfully we do get in-ear detection on these earbuds this year if you pull an earbud out your music will stop playing until you put it back in very helpful if you're listening to loud music and you want to hear someone talking to you a little bit better speaking of which let's talk about microphone quality now the mics in these earbuds are surprisingly good and even though there's you know a little bit of that digital compression noise going on it's still a much better sound than most of mostly still much better sound than most other earbuds and that brings us to the sound quality of these earbuds now here's the thing about regular airpods i've never really been fond of how they sound and that mostly comes down to how they're designed they let sound in and out very easily and i found that the low end of most songs just didn't really carry much weight now airpods 3 don't really fix that first part there's still a very open design with very little cancellation so sounds from your environment will very easily pass through and get in the way of your music now depending on what you want to use them for that could be a pro and it could definitely be a con they also leak audio very well too if you're the kind of person that likes to play very loud music anyone standing in your immediate vicinity will be able to hear it at least a little bit as well but that second part the part about it lacking a low end that part has been improved with these airpods 3 quite a lot i actually found myself really enjoying the audio quality of airpods 3. they're way better than i remember airpods 2 being and even though i'm certainly no audiophile i think most people will be very very happy with how they sound they've added a few new features to airpods 3 that were there in airpods pro as well like spatial audio dolby atmos and adaptive eq now keep in mind that many of those features that are on the airpods 3 won't be available on an android phone though you'll get some limited spatial audio and dolby atmos support on android but worse than that is you'll be missing out on a lot of great features like seamless switching between devices uh voice assistant support notification announcements and find my tracking in fact airpods 3 are kind of a hard sell for android users i can see android users going for the airpods pro because they have an excellent active noise cancellation and pass-through mode that can be used no matter what os you're using but since most of the extra features of airpods 3 are locked behind apple's great walled garden android users get a little bit shafted but that's not really the small problem i talked about at the beginning of this video it's related but it's not what i was referring to the problem is that these new airpods 3 are priced very closely to what the airpods pro often go for i've often seen the airpods pro sell for as low as like 190 us dollars and while that isn't cheap it's only like 10 more than the 180 that these are selling for now now i'm sure airpods three will go on sale too once they've been out for a little while longer but for right now i'd actually recommend waiting to find a good deal on airpods pro unless you specifically want the airpods 3 for the fact that you don't have to stick those silicone tips in your ear the airpods 3 are a fantastic set of earbuds i just wish they'd priced them a little bit more competitively either way hope you liked the video thanks for watching and as always have a great day,AirPods 3,The airpods 3 are an excellent set of wireless earbuds on the outside the case for the airpods 3.Despite one small problem that we'll get into later on they are an excellent set of wireless earbuds.The previous iterations of regular airpods didn't fit very well and i didn't really like them for that reason. The airpods 3 are priced very closely to what the airpods pro often go for.You'll get limited spatial audio and dolby atmos support on android.You'll be missing out on a lot of great features like seamless switching between devices.
78,p_v-v0CWzKw,AirPods 3 Review after 1 Month: Why I DITCHED AirPods Pro..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_v-v0CWzKw,Max Tech, i've been using the airpods 3 for over a month now so today i'm going to talk about everything that i discovered along with why i stopped using my airpods pro and instead started using the airpods 3. who would have thought that when apple had courage to remove the headphone jack in 2016 and right away gave us a solution to the problems they created that airpods would become a massive company ranking in the top 30 beating out both nvidia and amd's revenue combined and almost reaching tesla's in 2020. people hated the idea of spending 159 dollars for wireless earbuds but here we are years later and that price seems like a bargain with the new airpods 3 coming in at 180 bucks not far off from what you can buy airpods pro for this made it a really hard sell when we first tested them but thankfully a month later you can now pick him up for 150 bucks which we'll link to down in the description so after all of my testing are the airpods 3 actually worth spending 150 bucks on let's talk about comfort these things are extremely comfortable even for somebody like me that doesn't have any issues with the airpods pro i know some people do some people just don't like that sealed design and some people simply can't use them which is why the air pods original have been still very popular now compared to those air pods these do have a larger design i feel like they fit more snugly into my ears but they are not uncomfortable for me for a select few people they might be a little bit too large but in general these things fit very nicely they do not move and i think it is a much upgraded design and because they don't seal into your ear you get none of that plugged feeling which is very very minimal on the pros because of the vent that it has but for this you just simply don't need it and you don't have to use the ambient mode or any software to be able to hear your environment everything just leaks in now there are two things that most people don't talk about when they're reviewing the airpods 3 that are exclusive to these new earpods the first one is a skin sensor that replaces the optical sensor and this is great because if you ever throw your air pods into your pocket they won't automatically turn on like the previous air pods and the next one is the precision finding in the app people lose airpods all the time and with this feature it can actually guide you to your ear pods just like if it had an air tag even if they're in their case which makes it a lot more difficult to lose them compared to airpods pro now as far as battery life these are also incredible and a really big step up from the airpods too i was getting about seven hours with just the buds themselves and i thought that was a little bit too high but i started doing some research online and that is what people are getting consistently so that's about a 50 boost compared to the airpods too and then with the case that adds an additional four full charges and that gives you roughly 35 hours of battery life which is amazing compared to most of their competitors now probably the biggest issue with the airpods 3 is the sound leakage these things get quite loud and the open design leaks a ton of sound i was sitting in the room and i had him up like maybe two thirds of the way and redeem two computer stations down could clearly hear all my music so if that's something that matters to you definitely take note that is something that is greatly minimized with the pros or other earbuds so if you're going to turn these up and you're in a quiet room everybody's going to hear what you're listening to and that open design without anything that actually goes into your ear canal is probably one of the biggest selling points and most of the competitors they don't offer that almost everybody makes earbuds that seal with a silicone tip so apple is making sure that they're still making this design for the people that love it and overall i get to say that i could wear these for about two hours longer than i can with the airpods pro and that is a big deal now as far as sound quality these things sound really good i love apple's new sound signature and what they have done it doesn't have as low bass as the airpod pros because it's not a sealed design but for mid bass they actually play about three decibels louder which is twice as loud while the mid-range is a little bit toned down and then on the high end the treble is also quite a bit louder and the ultra highs are toned down once again which gives it a more natural sound and after over a month of use i have to say that these are my favorite airpods in terms of sound quality apple's new drivers sound fantastic and i really hope they release pros that use the same technology because the sound makes me pick these up and use them instead of the airpod pros i also love the apple integrated magnets into this case so i just walk up to a mac safe charging puck and it will magnetize so i had one in the car i have one at my desk here and at home and it's just super convenient to be able to just attach it now i do know that the new airpod pros also have it if you get a newer build mine does not have that so it is one additional convenience feature now probably the biggest issue with these it's not really an issue but it's a downside is the lack of active noise cancellation now over the last month i've been doing a ton of stuff that requires this so it hasn't been that big of a deal but for certain cases where for example i'm vacuuming or i'm riding my lawnmower or mowing that is actually one time where i do want to pull out my airpods pro but other than that if i'm using them normally and a lot of times i like using just one earbud inside my ear these work a lot better for that and of course you have the benefit of the better audio quality so it's kind of up to you how often you you are going to use active noise cancellation and definitely something that's very nice to have if you're in a lot of noisy environments that's probably the biggest selling point that you still have to buy one of these airpods pros has been around for a couple years now if you're somebody that spends a lot of time talking on the phone for example phone calls or anything else the microphones in here are really good this is the microphone quality with apple's airpods pro in a normal room with some hvac noise and this is the microphone quality with apple's new airpods 3 in a regular room that has some hvac noise they're basically the same identical mics as the airpods pros which are class leading so people can't even tell that you're using a pair of earbuds it sounds just like you're actually holding up your phone so there's not much to say there other than it works really well so overall after a month of use i have found that i really enjoyed the airpods 3 i like the smaller case i like the better battery life i like the sound quality of it the sound signature that sounds more natural you have more sound stage or distinction also between different instruments overall this is the better product now that they actually cut the price down to 150 bucks from the original 180 which was a little bit too high even though they already dropped it from 200 with the airpods to the wireless charging case i think this is a really good buy unless you need active noise cancellation and for those of you guys out there that do want active noise cancellation i would just say wait for the air pods pro 2 because they're going to get all the same improvements as these maybe even better sound quality so personally i'm very excited for those to come out and after a month basically what i found is that these are much better earbuds than what people gave them credit for when they came out because not only is it just you know a new design and basically the same thing like some people were saying so thank you guys for watching click that circle above to subscribe check out one of the great videos right over there that's been max and i'll see you in the next video [Music],AirPods 3,The new airpods 3 come in at 180 bucks not far off from what you can buy airpods pro for this made it a really hard sell when we first tested them.The first one is a skin sensor that replaces the optical sensor and this is great because if you ever throw your air pods into your pocket they won't automatically turn on like the previous air pods.The case adds an additional four full charges and that gives you roughly 35 hours of battery life.

79,ZExYbUQ4R8c,Apple AirPods 3 - Unboxing &amp; Review!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZExYbUQ4R8c,UrAvgConsumer, [Music] what's going on guys it's your average consumer and the airpods 3 are finally here this is the third generation of airpods today we're going to be going over everything you need to know what apple changed what they've added what new features it has all that good stuff but first let's talk about what you get inside of the box and this is apple guys so it's a pretty standard unboxing experience once you pop it open you'll of course be greeted by some paperwork you got your quick start guide warranty information all that stuff you're probably not going to read but once you get past that you get those airpods in hand but not so quick underneath that you've got your charging cable it's lightning to usb type-c but we're done with the boring stuff let's take a look at the airpods themselves and as you can see right off the bat this case is very very similar to that of the airpods pro they've got an almost identical design and once you pop the case open you'll see that the airpods inside almost look exactly like the airpods pro of course though there are no in-ear tips so for those of you folks who don't like to have those tips in their ears these are gonna be the experience you're looking for but now let's take a closer look at them to see if they're legit so here they are you guys the redesigned airpods this is the third generation the second generation pretty much looked exactly the same as the first uh but they had a couple of new features wireless charging case that kind of stuff but this is a completely new design they have a lot of the features that we saw with the airpods pro so if you like the idea of the airpods pro but you didn't like those little ear tips uh these are definitely for you you get a lot of those cool features that the airpods pro offer but now in a design that works better for you now what's actually different with these compared to the previous version right well first off the stem is a lot shorter now 33 shorter to be exact so they took about a third off of it and this makes it a little bit more low-key just like with the airpods pro uh so that's a good thing you don't have that long stem if you weren't a fan of it i think a lot of people got over it over time but either way it is now shorter but with this new stem since it is similar to the air pods pro you also have that force sensor so now this force sensor when you want to control your music all you have to do is give the stem a little squeeze you can squeeze it to play double tap or double squeeze to move forward a track triple tap triple squeeze to go back and you know you know the controls by now now this is a cool addition because the previous versions you had to double tap and that was like the only real option you had in terms of controls you could go into the settings and change what that double tap did but this you don't need to do all that you've got all the controls with that force sensor and of course you can activate siri by either holding down the force sensor or even just saying now let's talk about this design i'm one of those people who really relied on the airpods pro having those in-ear tips because it made it a lot easier for the airpods to stay in my ears i don't know about you guys but i was of the camp uh with the original airpods where they wouldn't sit in my ear well i've got some funky ears as you guys can see the part that of my ear that would hold the airpods in kind of goes downward whereas carl has like the perfect ear for air pods made for it as you can see his goes upward so it's got that little area right here that just it just holds it perfectly so airpods pro personally that's what i have to rely on i need to use in earbuds um but for the most part if you've got you've got those nice ears those perfect ears then you'll be all right i feel like i should hold this down because i do have the perfect gears you know carl you're a sneaky one now obviously everybody's ear shape is going to be different right but thankfully the airpods has this pretty cool feature called adaptive eq these actually have a built-in microphone that is essentially there to listen to what you're listening to so it picks up the audio the way your ears are picking up the audio and with that adaptive eq it will automatically remember that these can possibly produce did that make sense carl you get that so carl just told me that was a lot of information so basically the dummy version the average consumer version like what i'm supposed to be doing is that these will automatically hear what you're hearing and make sure you're getting the best audio quality that these can produce with me because you lost me last night you you keep me on my toes carl you keep me grounded it's getting too nerdy over here now in terms of some other cool features that you're gonna get out of these earbuds is of course spatial audio you've probably been hearing that a lot basically with spatial audio let's say you're watching content this thing is going to use the accelerometer the gyroscope all that good stuff all the tech inside of here and it's basically going to allow you to like move your head and it's basically like you're in a sound bubble audio that's coming from here will keep coming from here no matter how i turn my head so that's a pretty cool feature uh it's definitely something you guys should experience if you haven't yet it's not one of those features that's like oh gotta buy these earbuds for spatial audio but when you try it out it's pretty cool now these have a really cool feature that i want to see come to the airpods pro and that's a skin detect optical sensor what does that mean right basically you know when you take out your earbuds and your music automatically pauses but like let's say you put them in your pocket really quickly you got to go do something you'll notice that your music is playing or something is playing or you're picking up calls while it's in your pocket and you're like where's the audio going to that it sucks right well apple has done something great here and made this able to detect when it's actually touching your skin versus just being in your pocket so it uses this optical sensor to avoid getting too technical again you guys basically it's going to be able to read whether or not it's in your ear or maybe in your hands versus just like thrown in your pocket so check this out right so we've got audio playing right take it out it pauses hold it in my hand it plays skin now i throw it in my pocket still paused that's amazing you guys and that's gonna save battery as well now let's talk about the battery these have gone from a five hour rating to a six hour rating so now it will last you an hour longer and you get an extra charge basically with the case so you get a total of 30 hours instead of the 24 that we used to see which is nice always good to see better battery life these have it and five minutes of charging in the case will give you like an hour of listening time so that's always nice um one thing that's really cool about this case though is that it now supports magsafe so if you want to go ahead and just put this on a magsafe charger or something you'll be able to do that very nice and simple i hope they mag safe all the things mag save me how you forget your own you were trying to make it a thing and look at you it never happened so listen i get a lot of comments saying magazine i'm like you guys are you can't be serious but something else that's actually really cool is the earbuds are now ipx4 rated so that means you know that sweat and water resistance that kind of thing is there but so is the case we usually see it from the earbuds but not the case so now they're both offering that kind of protection which is dope so i can just accidentally drop in the sink you definitely don't want to drop it in the sink uh it's pretty much resistant to like water splashes stuff like that so if water gets on it nothing like some like not being submerged or anything like that you know we'll splash sprinkles of water you know nothing crazy but yeah now if you want to go ahead and work out with these you can officially do that but the bigger question is how do these actually sound i definitely think these are a step up compared to the previous generation apple has some custom drivers inside of here so these are brand new drivers apple redesigned the way the acoustics are in these earbuds and they actually sound pretty good it's able to produce some pretty solid bass vocals come in very clearly and they're actually able to get pretty loud they're not gonna blow out your eardrums or anything like that uh but they're pretty decent in terms of the volume that they produce i think for everyday people who are picking this up they'll be pretty happy with the audio quality that they get out of these i'll be honest with you guys me personally i'm very used to using in-ear tips and the kind of sound that that delivers with the bass and the way it all gets handled with the seal so i'm more of a fan of those so airpods pro are more of my thing but like i said i know a lot of people out there hate those kind of earbuds so this is going to be the best option for you if you're looking for air pods now what's nice about these is that they're coming in at 179 which basically replaces the second generation air pods in that price point but it's the new model then this one pretty much comes with the wireless charging case and the new earbuds so 179 for these which i think is a fair price but if you don't want that they're still the older air pods those are going to be going for 129 and of course you know the airpods pro are at 250. so this is right in the middle there uh and i think this is something that a lot of people are going to be picking up especially around the holiday season it's a wrap for these you guys i think a lot of people are gonna buy this but that about wraps it up for this video guys hopefully you got some insight into the new airpods how they perform if they might be a right fit for you let me know what you think of them down below in the comment section i'm gonna catch you guys in the next one there's probably going to be another apple video today so stay tuned for that but till the next video guys it's your average consumer peace all right carl here take it take it,AirPods 3,This is the third generation of airpods.The case is very similar to that of the airpods pro.There are no in-ear tips so for those of you folks who don't like to have those tips in their ears these are gonna be the experience you're looking for. The airpods have this pretty cool feature called adaptive eq these actually have a built-in microphone that is essentially there to listen to what you're listening to. spatial audio lets you like move your head and it's basically like you're in a sound bubble audio that's coming from here.Apple has done something great here and made this able to detect when it's actually touching your skin versus just being in your pocket. The earbuds are now ipx4 rated so that means you know that sweat and water resistance that kind of thing is there.The case now supports magsafe so if you want to go ahead and just put this on a magsafe charger or something you'll be able to do that.The bigger question is how do these actually sound.
80,50fqpXh0FO8,*NEW* AirPods 3!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50fqpXh0FO8,iJustine," (upbeat music) - Hey guys, it's Justine and guess what we have here. If you guessed AirPods Generation Three, you would be correct. I am so excited about these because I absolutely love the shape of the AirPods Pro, but I loved the fit of the original AirPods. So the original design of the AirPods is actually taken from the wired earbuds, which I'm sure many of you guys might remember, but this is kind of big news because apple actually did change the design slightly for the new ones. So let's unbox them and check 'em out. Um, can we get a drum roll please? (hands hitting table imitating drum roll) Okay. We still have one more thing. (gasps) Oh, whoa, oh, this is interesting. I thought this was going to be the exact same size as the AirPods Pro case. And it looks like it's a little smaller. Oh, it is. Look at this. (gasps) Whoa. So this is the new Gen Three and this is the AirPods Pro. From the top, it kind of looks very similar. Anything else? Oh yes, we have a cable. Thank you. And it's USB-C. Nice. Still lightning, but the other end is USB-C. (upbeat music) Let's take a look at these new AirPods. (gasps) It's so much smaller. Like, look at that little stem. It's just about the same size, I think, as the AirPods Pro. So let's line them up and just really take a peak. So, Gen Three, AirPod Pro, and the previous old school AirPod. Look at that, that's a long stick. The real test though, is what's it gonna fit like? I got a little left and a little right, And in... oh. They feel a little bit bigger than the old versions, which, for my little ears... Okay, I thought it was going to be a problem. But the only thing that happened was I got dizzy from shaking my head too much. They do have a little bit more of a, like, a larger fit and feel. It's actually a lot larger. Interesting. So here's what they look like. Okay. Here's the smile test. I'm smiling and they're not falling out. This is all really good news. One of the things that I love so much about the AirPods and HomePods, and basically everything that Apple has, you just have to bring it to your phone and it's like, ""Hey, do you want to set up this thing?"" Yeah, I do. How did you know? And the new AirPods are no exception. Media control, press once on either AirPod to play, twice to skip forward, three times to skip backwards. Look at this little tutorial! Yeah, we'll do some announcing. Oh, it looks like my case needs charged. So I guess I'll charge the case. The one thing that is great about these is the increased battery life, but how do they sound? All right. They are in my years, they have connected. Hits in spatial audio. Okay. We definitely need to listen in spatial audio. Let's listen to a little Ed Sheeran. (gasps) Oh, God, it scared me! Oh-- Okay. Spatial freaking audio. It's working, no way! Okay, all right. I need to turn this down. This sound quality, I'm freaking blown away. The-- like, especially with the spatial audio, like there's absolutely no comparison to the previous version like that-- this is unbelievable. I wish you guys could hear this right now. This is not me being, like, overdramatic iJustine, like, this is actually genuinely freaking awesome. I am so shook. Like, the sound of the AirPods Pro is so good. This is definitely on par with it. You just, aren't going to be getting the noise cancellation features or the transparency. But this sounds amazing. So I think the real test is I'm going to actually have to use these. Like I can't just be like, ""Cool. I'm here at my desk. I listened to one single song."" I need to actually take these somewhere. I need to go out. I need to run. I need to do my daily activities. I need to edit on these and really see what they're like. And maybe I'll even take these on a little trip, test them out on an airplane. Specifically, just for this video. Like, I'm oh, I'm going to hop on a flight just because I need to test these. I really-- It's not like I had a trip planned anyway ahead of time, I promise, I swear. (upbeat music) So the new AirPods are actually pretty awesome. I have a weirdly shaped ear that a lot of headphones do not work, especially earbuds. So they did change the shape. They are slightly larger, so they don't fit as well for me. But the sound quality of these is so, just absolutely mind blowing with the spatial audio that I really can't get over it. I've been editing with them on the new Macbook, I've been using it to go for some runs. I did actually travel this past weekend, I did a quick day trip to Napa and it was so awesome being able to actually listen to these and use them on the flight. So I did get to test these out in all of the scenarios that I normally would be using my AirPods and they worked great. They still fit. I do like that the stems are shorter. I love that these do have the force touch, so I'm able to control the audio. If you guys have never experienced the spatial audio, because they are only in the Pro version, it's gonna blow your mind. I can't wait for you guys to experience it. I also posted my Macbook review with the new 16 inch MacBook. So if you guys want to check that out, I will put an end card here, link, so you can check that out. I'll also put a link in the description.

81,iK-XCW03kDk,Apple&#39;s Most EXCITING New Product! (For Me) - AirPods (3rd Generation),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK-XCW03kDk,ShortCircuit," - I wouldn't really describe myself as a fan of anything, but I love my AirPod Pros. They sound fine. The active noise cancellation is excellent, without any kind of weird pressure on my ears, and they are among the most comfortable-in-ear headphones that I have ever used. So, when I saw Apple's third gen regular AirPods, which bring that AirPods pro shape to a lower price point, all be it without active noise cancellation, I was pretty excited. And this is my first hands-on, brand new, there you go, we're tearing off the seals. AirPods with MagSafe charging case, okay. For headphones, I actually see MagSafe as having more value for me personally, than it does for a phone. I don't have a tonne of difficulty lining up my phone on a regular charging pad. But every once in a while, I do miss with these, just because they're so small compared to the normal shape of a charging pad. That I could see that being extremely useful. AirPods. Thanks. Don't bother telling me what generation I bought, or anything like that, who cares, right? Still resentful of their naming schemes. Now is this smaller? It's smaller. I've sequestered myself, actually, Anthony did all our coverage of the event, so all I saw was that it's the AirPods Pro shape, but you don't have to pay quite so much for it. They are a lot smaller. Wow. They're basically the size of the old AirPods carrying case, except it opens up horizontally now, instead of, instead of vertically. Actually here, I'm just going to pull this out. That is like, is that, is it exactly the same size? Boy, is it ever close? Wow, hold on. I think it might be a little thicker. If it's thicker, it's marginal, it's really close, which means then that it's going to fit perfectly in your headphone pocket. Boom, just like that. Oh man, that goes into real easy. That is one of the biggest advantages that Apple has over their competition because there's tonnes of other earphones out there that have four-ish hour battery life in the earphones themselves and then offer another 20 something in the case. But where Apple really stands out, is that they do it in a case that is way smaller. And now they do it in an earphone that is really, really aggressively sized. To be clear, the new third gen AirPods have six hours of battery life, which is even more impressive given the size of the case. Now, one thing that I can tell you guys, that I'm going to miss immediately, is you can see that the silicone tip from the AirPods Pros is not present on the new AirPods. One nice thing about this, is it means that after six months you won't be being shamed actively into buying a new pair, because your ear tips, which are white for some reason, turn yellow. There, that's a little less unpleasant looking, right Brendan. Now, interestingly, these are not really quite the same shape. - [Brendan] Wouldn't you be more concerned with the AirPods gen three clogging up with wax? - No, that's a really big grill. All you're going to need is a little bit of moisture, like an isopropyl alcohol. Get it kind of softened up a little bit, you should be able to pretty much wipe that out. I mean, the deeper it goes in your ear, the more wax buildup is going to be a problem. I know that some people in particular do have trouble with their AirPods clogging up with wax, but I'd say that they've actually done a better than usual job of making it cleanable here. Obviously, if it disassembles in any way, that was helpful for those kinds of things, it would be better, but never change Apple. Oh, is there anything else included? Yes. You get a USBC to lightening cable. So wireless charging sold separately. Okay, what I'm really interested in is the ergonomics, cause that's my favorite thing about the AirPods Pros. LG's latest tone freeze, the FP eights, are actually very, very close in terms of comfort, but these are really, really good. I just want to put my regular Pros in for a sec here. My daily drivers. Okay. Basically perfect. They're impossible to remove from my ears without putting my fingers in to take them out. I actually sleep with them in almost every night. I turn on the active noise cancellation, just kind of helps me sleep through random noises. I absolutely love these things. Let's see how much you're giving up, for what is it, 70 bucks? That's the difference in price, I think. Hmm. They're not going to come out, but you're also not going to have that snugness that you get from a silicone ear tip. My biggest takeaway just from putting them in my ears, haven't even listened to anything yet, my biggest takeaway from them right out of the gate is, Apple, please don't discontinue the Pro line. Not everyone likes that in ear canal, sort of violated feeling though so, your mileage may vary. But the other thing you're not getting compared to the Pros, is you're not getting any kind of passive noise isolation, which is not the same as cancellation. So the Pros have both. They isolate well, because they've got this nice seal with your ear. But, they also actively noise cancel using the microphones that are on the outside of the earphone. These have neither, there's no active noise cancellation, and because they don't form a seal with your ear, I can hear every bit as well right now. maybe slightly less well, but almost as well as if I didn't have them in at all. But no, I don't want to find contacts. Just not now. I'm trying to listen to music you idiots. Why's every music app wanna know everything about you. Well, I mean, we all know the answer, but stop. Oh my God. I have to put iOS 15 on this iPhone. While we wait, it's time for message from our sponsor. - [Brendan] Hey-ya. - Hey-ya indeed. Instructions, dip the toothpick, dab it on your tongue. Read the sponsor spot. Don't be a B word. Flatline hot sauce. If you're not familiar with D-Brand, they make expensive electronics tape that you can wrap your devices with. This is from a drop we did with them awhile back, their sticker bomb skin. Message them and ask them for it. I know they've got, they've got lots of this still. It wasn't limited edition at all. And they also make a habit of trolling me in their sponsor spots, that they must sell a lot of electronics tape in order to pay for it because they're not cheap. Pepper palace the end. I just want to know what's in it. Oh, Reaper's okay. Oliorism, capsism, capsism? I think I've heard of those before. I think those are bad things. All right, well good luck everybody. (man choking) (man laughing) - [Brendan] Oh no! - D-Brand if I end up with hiccups for the entire rest of this video, I'm going to be pretty pissed off. That's it, D-Brand, you don't get any more talking points than that. Don't like it, complain to your reps boss. Oh wait, he don't care. The cold water is so soothing. LTTstore.com, baby. Updates done. We're ready. I'm expecting a super simple pairing process, connect. Press once to play, pause, twice to skip forward, three times just to backwards. Here we go. Oh, interesting. Okay, I was not expecting them to make a noise when I put them in my ears because that's usually the indicator for whether you're turning ANC on and off. Okay. Holding just gives you Siri. Oh shut up, Siri. I do strongly prefer the squeezed style stems compared to the tap in the old regular AirPods. This is way better. It's way harder to accidentally actuate and it's way easier to hit on purpose. Got the same little tic noise to confirm that it registered. Now how do I control whether spatial audio is on? I can tell that it's probably on right now. That seems like a weird thing for them to have on by default though. The fact that there's so many hits for this tells you everything you need to know. Settings, Bluetooth. Thank you for not bringing that up when I searched for it. There we go. You can turn it on in control center. So I can't turn it on here? It doesn't do anything, see? This is just to hear the difference. Okay, it was on. So that explains why it had that huge kind of sound to it. Let's turn it off and see how they sound without any weird digital tricks. I could see people liking it in the same way that there's a lot of people that do like DSP effects, you know, like to give them more auditorium like sound to what they're listening to or whatever else. Personally, I strongly prefer to listen to music as the artist intended it without any effects. That's not my vibe here. I'd also probably never use that head track mode. Now that's interesting. Apple is doing more than just adding a DSP effect here that gives it spatiality. They're also playing around with EQ as far as I can tell. And in much the same way that modern laptops, if you listen to their speakers with the drivers installed, they sound horrible. Manufacturers are adding a lot of software compensation for the drivers that make them sound better. I think Apple is actually tuning the sound, as well as adding that openness to it. - [Brendan] Yeah the big thing is they have an adaptive EQ on these ones. - Sorry, adaptive EQ? Where do you adjust that? There appears to be just running all the time. That's a really interesting move because I think a lot of people are going to turn on the spatial audio and they're going to be like, wow, how did they ever listen to music before this? But a big part of the effect is coming from something that doesn't have to do with that spatial effect. I wonder why? Well, I guess I don't really wonder why, I guess it's a way to have people hooked on the Apple ecosystem. Because to my knowledge, these features won't be supported if you pair it to an Android device. Like I do. I actually daily drive these with an Android device. All right. Let's move on though. How do they sound compared to the AirPods Pro? Because I think that's the decision a lot of people are going to be making. Especially with how much more expensive the gen three AirPods are compared to gen twos. Interesting. So my option for spatial audio goes away when I'm sharing my audio. It's really hard to compare. It's like comparing an open backed headphone with a closed back headphone. They have very different flavors. Another thing that makes this challenging is these are my daily drivers. I listen to them every single day. So inherently there's a bit of bias towards them because your ears tend to like what they often listen to. I, other than the lack of noise isolation and noise cancellation, I can't find a problem with them compared to the AirPods Pros. I'd say they are on par. To be clear, neither of these are audio file grade IEM's. If you wanted those, you could expect them to have a wire on them, but they both sound good enough. And if your main concern is not tuning out the world around you, man, these are huge step forward compared to last gen. In terms of comfort, in terms of sound. Yeah. What can I say? Good product. - [Brendan] Do you Want to test the microphone though? Oh, the mic. Is the mic supposed to be worse? Oh, I mean, yeah, we can do a quick, we can do a quick call. What's up Mr. Ten? How's my, how's my audio quality doing over there? I would have you test my AirPods Pros as well, but I have a slight problem with the microphone on my AirPods Pros because I ran over this one in my car. (man grunts) (man laughs) Microphone is a little bit, it used to be good. - [Brendan] It used to be good. Well, we can't really fault apple for that one. (Brendan laughs) - Just like my videos used to be good back when I was in the kitchen, Linus sucks now.

82,3Dp3fiOFCMQ,A New Era of Premium Earbuds (NEW JABRA ELITE 7 PRO),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dp3fiOFCMQ,Mike O'Brien, jabra claims to have reinvented true wireless earbuds with their new flagship the jabra elite 7 pro but with so many incredible earbuds selling for less than 100 adding wireless charging or anc is is no longer enough to stand out in a sea of wireless earbuds so what did jabra actually do to make these earbuds so much better well they did a couple things let's get into it hey everyone welcome back to the channel i'm mike o'brien and like i said this is the jabra elite 7 pro a pair of earbuds that have been much anticipated by anybody following earbuds and i mean i personally have been really excited about these since they were announced and more importantly since i reviewed the jabra elite threes but before i explain what the difference is here let's kind of take a little rewind and talk about a brief timeline of jabra earbuds so two years ago jobber came out with the elite 75 t's in my opinion these were arguably the best jobber earbuds that they ever made at least until now but that was because they had fantastic bass they had a great battery life a great fit very very comfortable and for a long time they were one of my favorites on this channel in the earbud reviews and my comparison videos they usually came up on top or at least very near the top and then last year so one year after the 75 teas jabra came out with the 85 ts and the jobber 85ts i thought kind of took a step back so while they were better in that they added powerful active noise cancellation and they added a qi wireless charging on the case they took a step back because something i really liked about jabra was that compact form factor the small case the long battery life like fitting everything into something so small i thought was really important and the 85 ts added a lot of ball and then a couple weeks ago jabber came out with the elite threes and since i reviewed them on this channel which i'll link to that down below i actually really love these earbuds fantastic case very similar design to what we saw on the 75 tees and since i made that video i've actually worn these on every single run i've gone on which is several times a week that's because i find that they're lighter and more secure and and overall i just feel like they're better for workouts than most other earbuds on the market but now we have the jabber elite pro 7 which i'm more than confident is definitely going to take the place of the jabber elite 3s at least for my workouts i really like these earbuds and let's start off with a physical tour to see what they're actually good at now you can see the case design is a little bit different and at first i was skeptical of this because one of the things i really loved about the jabra elite 3s and the 75ts was the compact case i thought it was a fantastic design the way it opened it was small it fit well in your pockets and everything about it just made a lot of sense but now they went with a more clamshell design more similar to what we saw with the galaxy buds which is another case design that i definitely do like of course with this new case design you are getting a bigger surface on the bottom for qi wireless charging which i think is a positive and you do have some fast charging options where you can charge it for five minutes and get one hour of listening but when you open up the case by far one of the best features of these earbuds is that incredibly small compact size and shape so these earbuds fit incredibly comfortably in my ears much like the jabra elite 75ts actually even better than those honestly and they're more secure than the 85ts i found that these earbuds not only feel incredibly light when you're working out they don't feel like there's too much in my ears not a lot of pressure build up and being that they're so small and compact you would expect all right maybe they compromised on sound quality maybe they compromised on the battery life they actually didn't either just as a side note i have a lot of other earbuds on my desk right now so if you want to see those videos coming out very soon be sure to go down and click that subscribe button and the bell icon so you don't miss those videos so as i mentioned one of the aspects of jabra earbuds i've always been really fond of is how flush they are in your ears so when you wear them they never look like they stick out too far they're never too bulky and now these being even smaller are even more subtle so whether you're wearing them for video meetings or whether you're wearing them on a bus or in public or any other situation a subtle light pair of earbuds i think looks a lot nicer and speaking of looks they also come in three different colors so these are the black and gray ones obviously there's also an all-black version and an all tan version so i mean honestly you can choose whichever one looks the most subtle to you something strange i noticed with these earbuds is when i take them out of my ears because the silicone tip is so soft a lot of times it turns inside out and looking on the outside you'll see another thing i've always really liked about these earbuds being the really perfectly tactile physical buttons so unlike a lot of earbuds that have touch controls the physical buttons i think perform better when you are outside and you're wearing gloves or if your hands are wet or literally any other situation where you want to use a button instead of a physical touch control i think there's more situations than not where touch controls just end up not working as well as you want them to so physical buttons are fantastic i'm happy to see that on here and looking on the inside of the earbuds you'll see we have our charging nodes we have our tiny little proximity sensor these do actually have auto play and auto paws when you put them in or take them out of your ears i think that's a great thing to have and they have microphones that are really hard to see on these earbuds but we'll get into a microphone test in just a second to see how good that actually is because again when you go on their website that was one of the massive claims they made they've been talking all about their improved hear through their improved microphones and everything along those lines so really summarizing the physical design i think it's smaller it's more compact they still have physical buttons the physical buttons feel great and now they have ip57 water resistance and dust resistance as well meaning that these are really durable so physical design has always been something jabber really did well and i think that's a great thing that i commend them for but the the microphones have never really been leading the pack so the fact that they're claiming that these are leading the pack makes me really interested in trying them out so let's actually get into a test right now and see how the microphones actually sound okay so getting into a microphone test this is what it sounds like indoors in a studio environment with the jabra elite 7 pro so you can leave a comment and let me know how these sound to you but of course you're not always going to be indoors in a quiet environment sometimes you're going to be outside on a sidewalk or near some noisy traffic so let's go in a louder environment and see how they perform there all right so now we're outside by a pretty busy road a lot of ambience out here so leave a comment and let me know if you can hear what i'm saying in a noisier environment now with such a compact design you might assume that jabra compromised on the sound quality or the battery life and that's actually not the case i found that these earbuds have a pretty fantastic battery life but depending on where you look you find different numbers like jobber's website said 8 hours or 30 hours with the case but on the box it says you get 9 hours with the earbuds and 35 hours with the case regardless of what it is it's a fantastic battery life and it should definitely get you through a pretty long time listening to these and another benefit is if for some reason you wanted to extend that battery life or if you just want to do this for any other reason you can listen to just one earbud at a time so these do have mono mode again something that in the past jobber earbuds have kind of struggled with so that's because they're now using bluetooth 5.2 which is huge positive but that kind of leads into one of the first drawbacks unlike a lot of the previous java earbuds at least at launch these don't have any kind of multi-pairing so i cannot connect to two devices at once as i used to be able to with the 75 ts and the 85 t's instead at least right now i'm only only able to connect to one device at a time with the jabra elite 7 pros and speaking of the connectivity and the features of these earbuds let's take a look at the app the jobber sound app has a lot in there and it always gets a little better with every generation so right here you can see the jabra elite 7 pros has a lot of things here we can have different levels of active noise cancellation which i'll talk more about that in a second we also have hear through mode which has many different levels of that as well and from my experience the hear through is really clean with this that was one of the things they bragged about when they launched these earbuds and kind of rightfully so i think it sounds really clean and really crisp with almost no delay at all so it sounds like you're not even wearing them that's something that i was really happy to see we also have an equalizer down here with several different ways you can eq this the energize is pretty exciting and of course i'll talk more about sound in a second but realistically like they have a lot of capabilities i found that when you adjust the eq you can really max out each one and or minimize each one and you don't have a lot of distortion and then of course they have their soundscape as well on the bottom which is something that jobber has always had it's just white noise something to sleep with and since these are so much smaller than a lot of other earbuds i could definitely see people sleeping with these and playing some white noise in the app i also love that you're able to customize the controls now i mentioned that the sound quality with these earbuds was pretty substantial despite being in such a tiny form factor they didn't really compromise much but there was one thing that i wish they had and that is higher quality codecs these are limited to spc and aac which if you have an iphone is all you're able to do anyway but regardless they seem to sound really good they have a very powerful bass that doesn't really lose balance no matter how you eq this and i found that you know even if you want to eq and max out the bass or totally minimize the bass you really don't have much distortion and even when you max it out it doesn't sound too muddy overall i think they did a really good job presenting the balance in a very capable pair of earbuds and the only complaints i had of course being that you don't have the higher quality codecs these are not the most analytical pair of earbuds out there and they are very slightly sibilant but otherwise they're very fun and lively sound i find that for most people anyone who's not an audiophile you're going to absolutely love the sound of these earbuds like i said powerful bass very capable and they seem to sound really balanced in just about every genre i've tried to listen to but the active noise cancellation on these earbuds is unfortunately not quite as impressive as the sound quality or the form factor or anything else about these earbuds i found that while the asc definitely does a decent job blocking stuff out it's nowhere near the level of the sony earbuds or even the airpods pro so for anc they do the job well enough but they're not going to be anything too substantial but that's been it that's my take on the jabra elite 7 pros overall they're a pretty fantastic pair of earbuds but do they justify the price difference between these at 199 versus the jabber elite threes which are less than half the price honestly i would say that for most people if you're on a tight budget it's going to be a no-brainer to go with the cheaper pair of earbuds that still give you the benefit of having a job or pair of earbuds being a very comfortable very compact pair but for anybody who is not tight on money and you want a more compact pair that is very slim looks really nice very clean with great controls great sound and great microphones i mean the jabra elite seven pros are really a no-brainer but keep in mind like i said the active noise cancellation is going to be your one compromise you don't have the most powerful anc but you're getting a smaller pair of earbuds so let me know what you think would you prefer the sony xm4s with their larger form factor but with that get better active noise cancellation or something smaller like the jabras right here which give you not as great active noise cancellation but just about everything else in a really compact design i want to hear from you guys in the comments below as always if you enjoyed this

83,NIrbw9DsLKU,Worth Buying In 2023? Jabra Elite 7 Pro Review,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIrbw9DsLKU,Picky Audio, hey everyone today we're going to be revisiting the Jabra Elite 7 Pro they've been out for just over a year now and maybe you're deciding between the Elite Four from Jabra or you may have had the old pair the 75t which I still use today because they were ahead of their time and I gotta say the elite 7 Pro are also ahead of their time they're still one of the best you can get at their price because these go on sale the lowest I've seen them is 99 U.S and at that price the value you get is ridiculous these buds have also been updated quite a bit since their release so we're going to cover everything today but starting with how the buds fit and I don't know what it is about Jabra earbuds they just work for me really well the 75t were one of the best overall fitting earbuds they have the best security that I've ever tested and the comfort is not the best because the 75t had a lot of suction and pressure in the ear canal which I personally didn't mind I use them when training but the elite 7 Pro here Jabra fix that problem they still have a bit of suction and pressure but nowhere near as much as a 75t but this is basically the kind of Bot I can chuck in my ears even training doesn't matter what I'm doing lying down for bench press and leaning over for rows are always an exercise where the buds start to move out of place the 7 Pro staying completely fine when running though the only issue with having a bit of suction in the ear canal is that there is quite a bit of body born noise when running from the impact that you make on the ground so this will affect the sound quality especially bass Heavy Music basically for me not a pair that I use when running now compared to the Elite Four it's basically the exact same fit and if you want to grab one of the active pairs I've got the Elite Four active and the 7 Pro the only difference is the coating on the outside which at least for my ears it doesn't do anything it doesn't actually rest on your ear canal or anything like that so no point getting the active really really depends on what the prices are at I know the microphones are slightly different on the 7 Pro and the Seven active but all the pairs have an ip57 dust and waterproof rating this is very rare the five stands for dust proofing so find if you get sand and dust in it the seven is actually waterproof so you could submerge the buds in water preferably accidentally you wouldn't want to go deep diving in these but completely fine if you accidentally fall into a lake or something I don't know what you're doing now in terms of battery life Jabra have industry-leading results here because with noise canceling on you're getting eight hours from the earbuds and 30 hours in total with the case Chuck the buds in the case for five minutes you get an hour's playback the case is compatible with wireless charging now moving on to the case itself Jabra has some of the best build quality nice feeling plastic it just feels nice to touch the case it isn't the slimmest case so this is what it looks like compared to the airpods pro case for a little bit of reference still pretty easily pocketable and you just get one LED indicator on the front of the case so you know when to charge your case up now in terms of controls really great stuff here from java you have control of everything your play pause your skip tracks your noise canceling on and off as well as volume up and down you also get some great customization in the app you can customize everything except for the volume up and down control so really nice Freedom there a couple of issues though is that since these use a physical button which is great if that's what you're looking for it does require a bit of a press into the ear canal to work properly so an easy fix for me instead of pressing just straight in I kind of just push the earbud up slightly and then press so it doesn't dig into my ear canal which was a little bit strange a 75 t button was actually a little bit easy to press and these buds also have any detection for auto pausing and playing your music when you take the buds out of your ears I ran it through my pocket test where I take one butt out Chuck it in my pocket and just live my life normally from training or whatever and my music would start to resume when the bug was in my pocket you also get some more customization in the app you can even customize if you want to have the voice command to let you know what's going on or just have a beep we're on the Elite Four you only get the beeping sounds You Can't customize it as much and you don't get any control customization and the Elite 4 also uses a physical button and it's actually much harder to press in but you can do the same thing and that's the same work around now connectivity you've got Bluetooth 5.2 SPC and AAC and unlike the Elite 4 the 7 Pro does have Multi-Device connection so you can have two devices connected to the earbuds at the same time it's a little bit jittery when you're switching between devices I tested mime and my iPhone and my MacBook and you just have to pause playback on one device before you resume it on the other device you can also use one earbud while you leave the other in the case and this does work in mono mode so if you're using just one earbud you're going to hear both the left and right audio channel so you're not going to miss any of the music that you're listening to now latency with watching videos and movies is completely fine here are the results I got in my gaming latency test on both IOS and Android if you get around 400 milliseconds that's fine for casual games if you want to get around 200 milliseconds if you're into more fast reaction games like Shooters now I want to compare the Elite 4 microphone to the elite 7 Pro from my testing the elite 7 Pro sounds really good it is just a little bit quiet but here are the samples so you can hear for yourself all right so here I am in the outside world currently recording the audio off my iPhone so you can hear all the noise going on around me alright so here is the core quality of the Jabra Elite 7 Pro currently outside it's a little bit windy I'm getting bitten by an ant which is why I'm wiggling around all right and here is the core quality of the Jabra Elite 4 Active In My Memory they're very loud and also pretty good at blocking out background noise potentially better than the 7 Pro all right before we talk about noise canceling if you're enjoying the picky style of review here please subscribe if you haven't yet it helps me up helps the channel out it's also going to help you out if you like the video and you'll be able to see more of my videos in the future now how I test my noise canceling I Chuck on my soundbar I play simulation plane train and Cafe noise that also test all my earbuds in my gym and it's honestly not the best noise canceling for a more modern earbud it's actually very similar to the performance I got on my 75t which didn't even originally have noise canceling when they first came out it came with an update and they're also only just better than the Elite Four so you can get much better noise canceling today at a much cheaper price but it's still pretty solid overall you're gonna block out more consistent sounds quite well it's just the more inconsistent sounds where it doesn't work as well you do have some noise canceling customization in the app so you have this little slider kind of situation going on you just play around with that and see all gives you the best noise canceling result I highly recommend you do that because without that on the noise canceling wasn't that great the Elite Four also have the same thing and the transparency mode is also very solid I'm rating in an 8 out of 10 where you have a pair like the airpods Pro 2 they're a solid 10 out of 10 so very easy to hear things it's quite natural as well and the Elite 4 transparency also just behind the quality of the 7 Pro and you do have the option to customize the transparency strength in the up same on the Elite Four and I have to say the Jabra app is one of my favorite apps out there the user interface is super friendly it's very easy to know what you're doing and you get tons of very small little customization options with nothing unnecessary in there as well and with some of the best sound customization out there but before we talk about the sound quality we'll quickly touch up on volume so if you're looking for loud level listening these go incredibly loud and they also don't distort at high volumes this is the same on the Elite Four now the sound customization here is a pretty simple EQ on the 7 Pro the Elite 4 also has the same EQ with the presets there but I just found that the 7 Pro you could kind of play around that EQ and it would just tail the sound a little bit more where the Elite Four you can increase the bass and it'll kind of take away from the other frequencies so you get a little bit more freedom with the 7 Pro but what the Elite 4 doesn't have is the my Sound hearing test and this is one of the best sound tests that I've ever done a lot of earbuds have it and I find that it doesn't change the sound or it makes it sound really weird and basically you run through a quick hearing test it'll make some beeping sounds in your left and right earbud and this improved the sound quality to like my perfect taste and I just increase the bass and the treble ever so slightly it made the bud sound like 10 better it's a small thing but a 10 increase goes a long way so now I'll talk about the sound with that customization on and overall this is one of the best bass booster tunings out there while retaining a nice balance as well now if you've tried or owned the 75t sadly you're not able to get to base levels where the 75t went they still have the best deep subwoofer base out there like a 9.5 out of 10 on my sub scale where the 7 Pro it's more like an 8 out of 10. you can even EQ that with the bass boost eq1 you're not able to get to the levels that the 75t was able to get to so base this time round has a little bit more punch to it a nice blend of both mid bass and sub bass where the 75 T was more just sub bass so the mid bass did get a bit lacking at times but the base response on the 7 Pro it just works well with any kind of music you throw at it it's not too over the top but nothing is ever lacking and I really like the bass boost EQ on the 7 Pro it boosts the bass to a point I'm not getting too over the top but I like using that when training because I'm not like trying to intricately listen to my music I just want some nice energetic sound and it works really well now the mid-range here is very solid vocals and instrumentation never get lost it's not the best mid-range but it just gets the job done the treble is more of a standout though it doesn't have the most amazing Sparkle but you get some really nice precision and detail I always notice this being a drummer myself things like hi-hats crushes rise symbols have a nice direct sound this also carries over to acoustic guitars synth in electronic music it all has great separation but sounds natural at the same time rarely gets too harsh or similar as well well so if you are a bit more sensitive to treble but like a nice amount of it these are going to be the pair for you now the Sound Stage kind of like the mid-range nothing special but it gets the job done so combining all of this together is a pretty hard tuning default it's not the best sound quality you can get at the price but it's definitely up there with just enough customization to make them work perfectly for yourself now comparing the sound quality to the Elite Four the Elite Four are pretty solid the 7 Pro mainly the treble and the bass just sounds way better plus the EQ customization you have more freedom the my Sound hearing test plus you get the Multi-Device connection the control customization so keep that in mind if you're deciding between the elite four and seven Pro but back to the 7 Pro I gotta say these are 100 worth it today the only real issue is a slightly subpar noise canceling performance but now you're probably thinking how do they compare to other earbuds in the same price like compare to scored and rank them to six other earbuds in the video right here so be sure to check that out in the meantime stay picky I'll see you in the next video bye now,Jabra Elite 7 Pro,The Jabra Elite 7 Pro are still one of the best earbuds you can get at their price.With noise canceling on you're getting eight hours from the buds and 30 hours in total with the case.These buds also have any detection for auto pausing and playing your music when you take the buds out of your ears. The Jabra Elite 4 Active In My Memory are very loud and also pretty good at blocking out background noise.The Elite 4 also uses a physical button and it's actually much harder to press in.The 7 Pro does have Multi-Device connection so you can have two devices connected to the earbuds at the same time. This is one of the best bass booster tunings out there while retaining a nice balance.The 7 Pro you can kind of play around that EQ and it would just tail the sound a little bit more.The treble is more of a standout though it doesn't have the most amazing Sparkle.The only real issue is a slightly subpar noise canceling performance.
84,v3kdo-X7WiE,Jabra Elite 7 Pro review: BEST true wireless earbuds!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3kdo-X7WiE,TotallydubbedHD, the jabber elite 7 pro are flagship anc earbuds that come in at 200 pounds in the uk and 200 in the us and in this detailed review we'll be seeing if it's actually worth its price tag specifically in comparison to some of its major competitors now the earbuds don't get off to a good start because they are limited to the sbc and ac codecs only whereas a lot of his competitors support the aptx aptx hd or even the highest quality ldac or hwa codex it's a real shame that jabra hasn't incorporated these higher fidelity codecs because it would have improved on the overall audio fidelity that you can get over bluetooth nevertheless i was actually pretty taken back as to how good these earphones sound across the frequency range the six millimeter dynamic drivers do a stupendously good job now let's break it down in terms of each frequency range first off in terms of these sub-bass tones the jabra elite 7 pro very much like their predecessors the jabra elite 85t or 75t pronounce that low end rumble and therefore when you're listening to r b or dance music or even watching movies you're going to get a little bit of excitement and you're going to hear that low end rumble something that sennheiser for example can't really claim in doing similarly when it comes to the mid bass it's pretty punchy and yes you can eq it which i'll showcase very shortly but in its real default configuration the mid-bass tones are actually pretty perfect the overall quantity and quality is pinpoint accurate at least to my ears and i had no problems whatsoever in this department now as for the mids i was yet again taken back by the oval sound reproduction throughout the frequency range now they're not quite sennheiser-esque whereby they're not as forward-sounding as their sennheiser rivals but in comparison to pretty much every other earphone out there in the market they will come across in an excellent fashion take for example the grado gt220s the likes of the jabra elite 85t and 75t the oppo nco x the anker soundcore liberty 3 pros and even the libritone track air plus or the gen 2 variants of them all of these earphones have got a much more pushback and recessed v-shaped sound signature and it's not the same thing that could be said about the jabra earphones which yet again really took me by surprise now as for the highs they're a little bit overzealous at the top end at least in their standard configuration but thankfully you can eq that to your heart's content through the app and again i will talk about that very shortly but what i would like to point out over here is that they do extend very well and give you all the nice symbols and the top end clarity that you'll want and keep you kind of excited when you're listening to your music so with this in mind if you do not have sensitive ears then i think this standard configuration will pretty much suffice if however you're like me and you have a little bit more sensitive ears then that slight eq that you can take off the highs provides a pretty likable sound and one that doesn't give you any fatigue either and so what about when it comes to its sound stage because fundamentally the jabra earphones have got a much more smaller form factor in comparison to the likes of the sennheiser greater or newer true alternatives and indeed its rivals do a better job in providing a more airy sound stage however that's not quite the entire picture because when it comes to instrument separation while all of these earphones do a fantastic job in my opinion the jabras are the best in class and that's coming from someone who's reviewed in excess of 70 different true wireless earbuds and over 500 audio related devices i was absolutely taken back by the instrument separation of the jabra elite seven pros and it left me kind of jaw dropped i was able to enjoy my music in almost a different dimension and not in an artificial sense but one that really just got me to appreciate music all that bit more in a set of true wireless earbuds now sound quality is seriously impressive but what about when it comes to recording quality well yet again here jabra have done a phenomenal job i was very impressed with the jabra elite 75t which i often use as a reference and that progressed to the 85 t's which did an even better job and yet again here very much like the 85t the elite 7 pro do a great job of portraying my voice accurately and not sounding over bloated or kind of phased out towards the mid-range tones indeed if you want fantastic call quality the jabra earphones in my opinion still reign supreme speaking about one of its predecessors here the jabra elite 75t which you'll be able to pick up sounds very good on the whole but they'll sound a little bit boomier towards the lower end tones whereas the elite seven pros portrayed a little bit more of a more well-rounded and balanced sound signature when it comes to recording and just for comparison here's one of the rival earphones that you can find out there in the market and it's the oppo nco x the earphones just don't do as well when it comes to recording quality and of course there's some other earphones out there and i could continue this list of recording quality tests but it just gives you an indication of how other earphones compare to the jabra earphones specifically the elite 7 pros however it's not all positive because the jabras fall short when it comes to active noise cancellation and alas over here the elite 7 pros aren't anywhere near as good as its competitors from the likes of one more to the likes of sony or neura or let's say for example the anchor earphones oppo or libritone all these other earphones provide fast superior anc performance and here unfortunately the jabras fall short so much so that if i were to compare even the jabra elite 75t which are far cheaper earphones and you combine the passive noise isolation and the active noise cancellation technology you'd almost potentially choose the 75t over the likes of the elite 7 pro at least to my ear canals here i just found that the elite 7 pros while i had a fantastic fit and comfort with them just again didn't provide the same sort of passive noise isolation as the slightly chunkier elite 75 t's in this domain if we take passive noise isolation completely out of the department here the overall active noise cancellation is pretty much on par with its much cheaper sibling and therefore means that when you are comparing these earphones to class leading or even medium to high-tier anc earphones out there on market the jabra elite 7 pros really fall short so i referenced the app quite a few times so let's get into it now first off at the top you can see the battery level from the case and the earphones themselves and then you've got the active noise cancellation which you can adjust in terms of a couple of increments and the same could be said about the hear through mode so yes indeed you've got a hear through mode if you want to use it and of course if you don't want any of this you can disable it now as for the music equalizer you can see i've customized it where i've dropped the highs and the lows a little bit and increased the mids just that bit more for the more balanced sound stage but of course that is completely subjective you can completely customize that through the five band equalizer or go through one of the preset eqs now if you go through the settings cog here you're going to reveal a lot more options first off if you've gone to headset settings you've got the audio experience where you can enable music being played when you are running hear through mode you can also have my sound and this is a customized hearing profile in my case i can i completely disable that because i just didn't feel that it really bolstered the experience and as for the call experience you've then got for example the site turns which you can enable and also adjust as well which is again nice to see so the customization is definitely there and then you've got the headset configuration where you can enable how the sound modes behave you've got sleep modes headset feedback so for example when you're touching let's say the earbuds on the right hand side it gives you an indication of to what setting you're running and you've got in your detection so in other words it's a little sensor which mentions to see if you want it continuously playing when it's in your ears or when you take it out then you've also got a way of personalizing it so for as i said before you've got a different ways of customizing for example the active noise cancellation or in terms of the sound and of course when it comes to controls now when it comes to controls you can customize the left and right earbuds independently which is nice to see and you've got quite a lot of different options so for example single press or you can press and hold as well now when it comes to the options well you've got a few options to select from but the options in my opinion are pretty much what you would expect and will suffice for a lot of individuals out there and furthermore you can also customize it between between calls in terms of active or incoming calls and also in terms of media so it's pretty smart in terms of recognizing that elsewhere you can select your voice assistant where it's got amazon alexa built in as well if you want to use that and you can also check for firmware updates if you've got a latest firmware and therefore when you want to add extra features to the earphones now with the app aside i should also mention that when it comes to connectivity the earphones can be used independently from each other and therefore can be used in a mono format the switch is absolutely instantaneous and here jabra should be really commended for what they've done i've also heard that they also will be supporting multi-point connection as well which means that switching between devices should be a little bit more seamless now as for the earphones themselves the overall color of them i have no issues whatsoever they're available in three separate finishes and in this respect i find out pretty stylish now they've got a button found a physical button should i say found on each of the earbuds and as i showed you can customize it through the app however pressing the button does mean that you can hear it being clicked whilst it's in your ear canal and therefore isn't as comfortable as the likes of touch sensitive earphones which are good in this compartment say for example likes of the sennheiser true wireless momentum twos or the oppo enco x here these earphones provide really good touch sensitive pads and means that well it doesn't feel that you're kind of shoving the earbuds in your ears a little bit more when you are interacting with them but of course that is pretty subjective now this perfectly leads me on to the overall form factor of the earphones they're really slender in comparison to other audiophile grade earphones and while they're not the likes of let's say the oppo nco x when it comes to their stem design it does mean that when it comes to in comparison to let's say the likes of the sennheiser grader or neura true alternatives these earphones are far more comfortable i wouldn't go as far as saying that you can sleep on them but i will say that they're very comfortable i had no problems when it comes to doing light jogs either they don't really fall out of my ears but again that is quite subjective and it really depends on your own ear canals if you really want something for workouts then you're really going to be looking for something with an over ear design instead moving past that we do also get onto battery life and here the earphones have got an eight hours charge and which is pretty good and with the case it extends up to 30 hours the case also has wireless charging and also it has a usb type-c input which allows for fast charging which is great to see and finally it's also worth bearing in mind that the earphones are dust and waterproof where they're ip57 rated and so this brings me onto my verdict would i recommend the jabra elite 7 pros well quite frankly they do great across the board whereby they offer a really nice comfortable design they've also got a relatively small form factor a bit from the earbuds themselves to the charging case they've also got a good battery life and they offer fantastic sound and recording qualities however they fall short in two departments at least in my opinion and that's when it comes to anc performance and the overall bluetooth codec support however it should be worth bearing in mind that the former here isn't that impressive in the likes of the sennheiser or great alternatives either they either don't offer anc altogether and or have pretty poor anc performance too then you've got the likes of the newer trues which are an alternative that you might want to consider however if you're going to be taking calls or want to be using them on the go then the call quality of the mirrors are well no match whatsoever with all the other earphones i've mentioned specifically the jabras so here for me personally it's between three earphones the sennheiser and the grados and then the jabras if you're looking for a bassy or sound and you want something that's quite airy then you might want to look at the grados if you want something that's more mid-century but a little bit bass light and still airy in terms of its sound stage then you might want to look at the sennheisers if however you want a little bit of both but then don't have the same sort of airy nature and then also want class leading call quality then you should pick the jabras and for that reason they actually get my best buy awards so i'd be intrigued to hear your thoughts in the comment section below would you buy these earphones over the rivals specifically the ones i've just mentioned well just let me know i'm just curious to see what you would pick now of course if you like this independent detailed and honest review definitely do drop a like and of course subscribe and hit that bell notification all of which would be greatly appreciated and you can even follow my shenanigans on social media where on my instagram and twitter links will be down in the description below including to all the earphones that i've referenced including the reviews to each of these two now i've been totally dubbed and i'll hopefully see you in the next one take care of yourselves and goodbye,Jabra Elite 7 Pro,The jabber elite 7 pro are flagship anc earbuds that come in at 200 pounds in the UK and 200 in the us.They are limited to the sbc and ac codecs only whereas a lot of his competitors support the aptx aptx hd or even the highest quality ldac or hwa codex.They do extend very well and give you all the nice symbols and the top end clarity that you'll want and keep you kind of excited when you're listening to your music. The elite 7 pros portray a little bit more of a more well-rounded and balanced sound signature when it comes to recording.The oppo nco x earphones just don't do as well when it comes to recording quality.The overall active noise cancellation is pretty much on par with its much cheaper sibling. The jabras earphones are dust and waterproof where they're ip57 rated.They offer fantastic sound and recording qualities however they fall short in two departments at least in my opinion.You might want to look at the grados if you want something that's more light and still airy in terms of its sound stage.
86,w3JjsboLkcI,Better than AirPods Pro in 2021? (Jabra Elite 7 Pro Review),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3JjsboLkcI,TechOutAdam, all right moving right along what's happening everyone it's adam welcome back in today's video man techtober i swear there's so many things to review i wish i had the money and the time to review all these products but i'm only reviewing products i really like or i'm really interested in and when the jabra elite 7 pros which is what i'm reviewing today came out i was stoked mainly because i had a really good feeling these are going to do great with the microphone quality but also with active noise cancelling now it's a weird awkward metal child between the 75 t and 85 t's especially with the naming scheme i mean where does elite 7 pro fit in i mean this is the first time they had pro in any naming product they had with their earbuds or even headphones so that's what i'm going to be reviewing today thanks for watching ahead of time and i hope this helps so first off let's go over the specs of these because there's a lot to cover with them so number one they come in three different colors i got the silverish black ones they come in all black at best buy and then they also have a beige color which was my favorite but those were extremely back ordered so they have active noise cancelling you can use them in mono and stereo mode yes i said that right you can use each earbud independently finally because they didn't come with that for the 85 t's the wireless connectivity is bluetooth obviously bluetooth 5.2 and they have a range of 33 feet for the connectivity ip57 water resistant so in other words i think these are now that i think about it i think these are the first true allies earbuds you can pretty much take a swim in and dunk them in water and the microphone should work still as well as the audio the battery life is eight hours of battery time with the earbuds out of the case 30 hours total with the charging case and it takes about five minutes with fast charge to give you an hour of playback there is qi wireless charging and a charge via usbc so that's quite a bit of features already not including the microphone performance that they're that seems to be the biggest thing they're promoting and i'll definitely do a pretty heavy duty microphone test i mean you can't maybe you can see it in the frame but i have my bluetooth speaker right here to do a few different types of microphone tests to see how well they do so so far so good and when it comes to the case it has a matte finish very premium filling it doesn't attract fingerprints really easy there is a led light indicator for your battery life and then the usbc port is on the front which i don't mind at all i don't really care where it is i mean it's not like i use them at the same time i'm charging them in my pocket or something so for me so far so good and when it comes to the controls i actually have one important thing i noticed and that is with the app between android and ios so with ios you don't get volume controls for some reason and i did email jabra about this hopefully they do a firmware update even after this review i'll be totally fine with it but i'm not sure when so as of october 19th if they do it tomorrow at least i wonder ahead of time still but with android you do have volume controls where you hold it for a second on either earbud depending on how you configure it for volume up and volume down besides that the controls on either app are the same so pretty much have your basic control settings here play pause pressing once double tap to skip forward triple tap to go back you can customize the left or the right for cycling through a anc here through and turning it off and when you're on calls this is something very important to bring up i thought was awesome you can turn cytone on and off while you're on a call now and you can mute your calls so that's what makes these feel really pro when it comes to the controls is finally i just feel like you have total control of everything you're doing even on phone calls now but again there's no multi-point connectivity with these i don't know how much of a big deal that is for you but i think it's going to be a while until that's kind of the standard with true wireless earbuds period i mean it's really hard to do that with technology like this i mean you have two different earbuds connected to each other trying to connect to your case and your phone that's a lot of different connections you know so i i don't think it's a big deal i mean i'm kind of over it at this point honestly all right now let's talk about the fit of these so i'm going to put them in my ears and obviously i'm going to have here through on because the anc is way too good i'll be talking way too loud but before i get to how good the anc the hear through and just overall sound of these are i have to say the fit is one of the best fits i ever had in a pair of true wireless earbuds where coincidentally the only pair of earbuds as far as comfort goes that compete with these and that includes doing workouts and everything are the jaybird vista twos where those the anc is not as good as these i'll just say that off the bat but for 199 dollars i would say the fit is absolutely comparable with those in the same price range and overall i think it's because they have a way better seal where the silicone tips don't feel so cheap and they feel more pliable and mushy i guess they're not the silicone foam tips that you would find in the wf1000xm4s but i wasn't really a big fan of those anyway i like it when it's more this kind of material because it's just easier to take in and out of my ear and it just i just have to adjust weight less and yes i will do a shake test real quick to show you how well they do fit okay hopefully that was good enough because when i usually work out in these or go for a run or a walk or whatever i really have to adjust these and it doesn't matter what i'm doing they fit well and they basically stay in your ears it's only if i push the buttons a little too much obviously i have to adjust them then but it's rare so the media tips are what fit best for me but they do have small medium and large hopefully that's the right fit for most i think it will be they fit great now let's talk about sound with these so first thing i'll say right off the bat when it comes to the sound is i noticed a dramatic increase in bass with the elite seven pros compared to the 75 t's and 85 t's this is the best way i can put it i'm not an audiophile but this one makes sense so there's some earbuds and i think most where instead of the drivers increasing more and based on working harder on base it's really just an increase in distortion and reverb so it sounds like there's more bass it just basically gets louder these actually work harder with the drivers to give you more bass i feel it a lot more in my ears with these than the 85 t's and the 75t so that alone tells me these are much better and i would say get these over those just if you care about music quality now when it comes to the meds and the lows and to give you some reference and music i was listening to meek mill's newest album big sean's detroit album the latest one he came out with evil empire for age against a machine and also tools fear inoculum album so a wide range of music with just those alone and testing these didn't matter if it was danny carey's drums and fear inoculum or if it was maynard singing and eat the elephant or if it was all the bass especially with the intro song of freaking meek mill's new album everything bumped everything sounded great i mean i had no issues when it came to clarity hearing instrument separation and overall i think jabra did much better without sounding typical with their music profile where i usually prefer to have a music eq preset for whatever i'm listening to these it sounds great just on the neutral setting but if any of that is not enough with customizability on your own or the preset eq settings they also have my sound which basically is letting you know or testing how good you hear frequencies and it will tune an eq profile literally to your liking and how you actually hear so have no issues with that of course the soundscapes in the app which basically you don't have to download a third-party app to hear a ventilation fan or you know a waterfall or whatever anything like that to focus better if you're in a loud environment or maybe you just need to listen to something like that when you're trying to go to sleep kind of thing so pretty dope i mean it offers enough except for the volume setting issue so when it comes to the anc the active noise canceling i have to say these are the best at blocking out high pitched frequencies so dogs barking and anything like that milk steamers and pictures like that in a coffee shop it's the first time in a while i really wasn't able to hear that and i live in a neighborhood where there's a lot of dogs and no joke even on my walk earlier today i couldn't hear them which is kind of crazy i mean they'd have to really be next to me and not in a distance where with every other pair of chihuahuas earbuds i don't know what it is no matter how even with the waf 1000xm4 is those still let in high-pitched noises and i think bose is probably close to being the best the jabber elite 7 pros hands down are the best at blocking out pitched frequencies now overall sound they're more comparable with bose than they are as sony though i still will give sony the best for overall how much compression you get but high pitched noises jabra somehow mastered that i don't know how they did you can't adjust acting noise canceling to your liking and definitely test this out when you are in a loud environment so when you create that custom active noise canceling profile you really know what you're blocking out don't just guess in a quiet room you can't adjust hear through and hear it through sounds way more natural where for some reason i had like an insecure feeling or an issue with how artificial hair through sounded with previous products now it sounds natural other people's voices sound natural and nothing is amplified it just opens up the mics so it really sounds like you would when you just don't have them in your ears so major improvement on that and overall i just think it's really impressive i think it's worth the money just for the act of noise cancelling and how they did hear through alone compared to previous products now i'm going to do a microphone test and to give some context of this i'm going to do a coffee shop test obviously quiet room and dogs barking to kind of give a shout out or do a test for those with pets i don't have dogs but i know a lot of people are going to be working from home with these so let me set that up and then i'll be right back all right i'm back and what you're hearing is the jabra elite seven pros in my quiet office so test one two three there's a little bit of echo in here i don't have it totally sound proof and then i'm going to play the coffee shop bnb noise and last okay that's actually pretty loud i have anc on and i can tell it's really loud so i'm gonna be quiet for a second to see how well or not so well the ambient noise comes through okay now i'm going to continue talking i'm going to pause that now and then i'm going to go to a dog barking so i'm just going to pull up something on youtube or whatever since i don't have dogs now i got that dog barking sounds like a puppy whining maybe okay let's see if we can get one more dog in here let's see okay that's like a chihuahua or something okay so all right i'm going to stop that now i'm going to test a couple other things so you can take these out to mute yourself on a phone call so let me see if that works all right it sounds like it worked it said unmuted and then i'll do one more thing so now that you can use mono mode i'm going to put the right earbud in just to show a real world test on if it actually works i can actually hear side tone on this still and the voice recorder is still going so pretty dope i wonder if there was a noticeable difference in using one earbud too but that's the microphone test let's get to the rest of the review okay so do i think the jabra elite 7 pros are worth the money for 199 especially given that the other products are cheaper i would say skip the other products don't worry about the 75 t's or 85 t's get the elite 7 pros because of the anc alone and the microphone quality i mean just even when it comes to hear through the microphones are just so much better not just for and even with that solo earbud use microphone test i did i wasn't even planning to do that i was pretty impressed with just one earbud so instead of four mics you were using two or i was using two technically on that test but how well the microphones pick up ambient noise where it's not so artificial your voice doesn't sound weird with cytone or anything it made a dramatic difference with the microphone so that's the biggest plus of getting these even i mean the music quality was much better with the bass but everything else sounded the same and it was minor differences with me noticing any better pitch in the highs or the mids or anything so the end of the day i think they did a really good job with these it's definitely worth the upgrade if you're going to upgrade or if you're just considering getting these as your first job repair true wireless earbuds so it definitely set a new precedent i guess and how i feel because i definitely i'm going to be using these more than the bose quiet comfort earbuds and they're for sure better than wf-1000xm4s even though those are slightly better with a and c so you get a lot of good value with your money i mean good job jobber on these that's it for my review thanks for watching stay safe stay healthy and i'll see y'all on the next one,Jabra Elite 7 Pro,The jabra elite 7 pros come in 75 t and 85 t sizes.They come in three different colors.The wireless connectivity is bluetooth 5.2.They have a range of 33 feet for the connectivity ip57 water resistant. The fit is one of the best fits i ever had in a pair of true wireless earbuds.The elite seven pros have a dramatic increase in bass compared to the 75 t's and 85 t's.The active noise canceling is the best at blocking out high pitched frequencies. 7 pros hands down are the best at blocking out pitched frequencies now overall they're more comparable with bose than they are.i don't know how they did you can't adjust acting noise canceling to your liking and definitely test this out when you are in a loud environment.Overall i just think it's worth the money just for the act of noise cancelling.
87,c6t-FOL-H6c,You’re probably buying these. - Sony WF-1000XM5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6t-FOL-H6c,ShortCircuit, I'm so excited because let's face it if you're shopping for truly Wireless in your earphones budget provided you've probably got these in your short list this is the fifth generation of sonyist wf-1000xm5s they've been great for many generations I spent most of my time with the xm3s they were already awesome but I can see a lot has changed since then and even compared to the xm4s there's there's some changes extra small ear tips now come along with the smallest largest and mediums I guess these rolled out of here I'm assuming oh those must be the medium someone put the extra Smalls on we'll mess with those later what else is in this box which appears to be made of recycled material you've got this little wallet here for the literature not really gonna mess with that except this looks like a promotional thing maybe 360 reality audio a little tiny USB C to a charging cable for your case and that's it and then you've got this tiny case which is 15 smaller than last year's case and a lot smaller than the one that I tried I think still um this colorway is black with the copper highlights it also comes in silver and you've got a reset button on the back and a USBC charging port decent but a little bit sharp on the closed sound but I can mess with that little indicator for battery level on the front that's a green right now and here they are the buds themselves also smaller this time 20 lighter as well okay so they're glossy looking with matte black on the touch area and little copper vents there it's that silicone or foam kind of foamy but you can see there's little cracks and and stuff in it like definitely some kind of foam yeah they're all foam all right let's see how I like that there's a left and right indicators on here right as red stick them in they're very light oh I just heard a tone and now I can sense that transparency mode is on these are very light holy I think that I have earplugs at home that are the same weight as these and lightness is is I would say highly correlated to comfort over time I just put them back in the case for a second because I've seen other comments from media saying they're hard to get out of the case that's how I kind of knocked it out without even trying um I didn't notice that but maybe I can see what you're saying because the clearance on the top end for you to get your finger in there is maybe a bit tight but seems okay honestly I probably wouldn't have noticed that all right they're back in I'm gonna check out the app and check out the interactions first you know these are they're really in there it's like a deceiving feeling I guess it it must just have to do with the ear tips themselves if he got a good seal with those they're gonna stay in they've got an ipx4 English production rating for waterproofness so X means they didn't measure the dust protection and four is water and that is uh just splashes this is a very typical even budget earphones will have X4 so nothing great there you could maybe wear these in the shower definitely you could wear them in the rain to the gym but don't go swimming yeah what's going on in here they really want you to sign in what am I gonna get adaptive sound control that learns your actions and optimizes how Ambient sound is taken and that actually could be sweet if it can learn the kind of sounds that my kids make and take that out of there worth giving them my data for 360 reality audio setup I think I'm assuming this is kind of like Apple's spatial audio optimizes 360 reality audio on your headphones for an immersive experience as if you're out of live performance okay uh note here how it says headphones so in the comments if I call these headphones don't yell at me we can accurately reproduce the best sound field for you by analyzing the shape of your weird ears where the left ear is definitely more weird than the right ear and that's me what how is that completed I haven't done any photos of my ears is this app old you just installed this app now and we're not even signed into it how does it know separately though there is head tracking and that's supported on a app by app basis as well including Netflix and YouTube but this is bunk let's just get out of here this is insane I didn't know I was going to be encountering all these new things this is talking about like not even having to touch your phone you put your your headphones into your ears and it somehow knows what kind of scene you're in and we'll just start playing music that matches that scene like you can just start jogging and it'll be like ah you're you're jogging worth maybe checking out I'm not going to try it in this video but I'm not going to be like nah to that either that's pretty cool all right I'm finally in the dashboard and one thing that's interesting right off the bat is the show as much codec you're using up there I'm using AAC I don't know if I can change it from here but I'm assuming they also have ldac which is Sony's proprietary one and then the that other one that is just part of the Bluetooth standard but cool that that's exposed up there I guess interestingly you actually have to tap to enable the battery level of the case itself and they're letting you know that they're not in constant communication with the cases battery level so you only only ever get the level that the case is at when you pulled them out oh here's that activity thing you gotta sign in for and then some kind of just like about these headphones it's a very simple system here and then in the headphone kind of page there's more tabs so let's start playing some music and mess with the controls and all that right after this message from our sponsor thanks to power color for sponsoring today's video The Red Devil RX 7900 series of gpus are optimized for 4K gaming performance are quiet and cool during long gaming sessions and can be customized with power colors devil skin swappable back plates choose between two designs for your 7900 Red Devil there's the mesh pattern generative devil skin or the sleek and smooth

who's listening to all this metal on here okay so now I can see music is playing right here in this app that's kind of cool I doubt I'd ever hang out in here though but maybe so you can switch tracks like that or using the earphone is it a swipe no okay I went back a track by swiping back tap is playing pause double tap his next track oh man this is not a good it's not good guys look at all these Miss clicks and stuff I gotta just learn where to tap I guess I'll go higher up okay that's consistent all right so there's a dedicated page for changing the interactions and it's really interesting what they've done here basically there's two like sets of controls and by default one set which is called Ambient sound control slash quick access is bound to the left and the other set of controls which is called playback control is bound to the right but you can actually switch it up so you could swap that so playback control is only on the left or you could duplicate it so you have playback control like so the exact same functions per earbud on both sides it would be really weird if you just put Ambient sound control on both uh because then you wouldn't have any playback control at all one thing I didn't realize is that you can tap four times to raise the volume on the right and tap four times to lower the volume in the last so I think you just you tap four times and you enter the volume control kind of Arena and you just keep tapping to to knock it down if I can just try that right now that's getting louder you kind of have to just sit here and and tap a lot but at least it's pretty intuitive it does take a while to get into that mode though these do sound really good and they've got a lot of even passive isolation let me see what happens here I think let's see what they got for ANC noise floor if I turn it on and off do I hear a hiss oh yeah there's the hiss it's not too bad so I'm gonna get my own opinion on the sound now starting with this loud thrash song I'm not a loud music listener really I could see some people thinking these aren't loud enough although it might vary by your device another thing I like to look for is whether it gets harsh sounding especially with electric guitars high-end kind of sounds like that a lot of times when you turn it up it gets just really harsh so but these but with these that doesn't seem to be a problem all right let's go into like a base Year song oh look at that auto pause pauses when you pull it out that's cool oh yeah definitely got some low rumble on the base this song is a good test track because it has like this it almost sounds like a strummed bass uh line that on top of like the kick drum it's just like this really rumbly like oh the song was big when I was first listening to the Apple airpods Max when they came out and they have like really cooked bass and the uh that Rumble was just like so apparent on those headphones more than any other first impressions though they sound pretty good but don't take my word for it we've already had the LTT Labs team run their usual battery of tests on these headphones and they've given us frequency response curves as well as a active noise canceling performance chart so let's take a look at it so the first one we have here is the frequency response starting the left side of the graph the bass response is really close to neutral then heading into you know the 100 to 1000 Hertz range you can see there's a little bit of variation but this is a two degree that's really not going to be discernible to most people even Sam the person who does the audio testing for us said that he probably wouldn't have wouldn't notice this without looking at the chart at the same time so very good very neutral response from these things so if you're the type of person who likes listening to the artist's intent from whatever content you're listening to these are going to do a good job a lot better than last year they still have problems in the upper three kilohertz and higher range is whether you're seeing more of a discrepancy up to a 10 DB discrepancy at 8 000 but this is a great improvement from the xm4s before and again at 8 000 Hertz your ears are not very good at Discerning sounds at that level so you might not really notice this 10d even the greatest difference here which is 10 DB is probably not that noticeable one thing to note though if you're coming from headphones that have a more v-shaped curve that is they're overcooked in the lows and the highs these might sound less exciting to you or less like present to you even if they sound more like neutral or true to The Artisan 10 they could sound boring to you so you have to just get used to that this is the ANC curve so here the white line is not wearing earphones at all the red line is wearing the earphones but they're not turned on so that's the passive isolation you get from just having them stuffed in your ears and then Green is having the active noise canceling turned on you can see up to 500 Hertz that is where the active noise canceling is on and it is really performing really well this is some of the best actor noise canceling that we've tested you can see the green line is well below the red line at that point and then after 500 it's basically not on so when we tested these they sat in the dummy head and we did not pull them out and put them back in between tests all we did was switch the app from ANC on and off so the difference is you see beyond 500 Hertz are really representative of the actual differences and not too many other measurement errors so do the xm5s have good active noise canceling yeah they do the microphone it is a Bluetooth microphone so it's not going to sound fabulous but I figured I would do a test call for you people and you can just hear what it sounds like be me your grandma just called you it's 4am she's an early riser you answer with these on can she even detect who the heck it is is she even gonna know it's her favorite grandson with this audio quality you be the judge so to clarify on the way that they say they improved the microphone on the buds is that they trained an algorithm on over 5 500 million voice samples so that it can recognize what your voice is and take it out from the environment noise but on top of that they also have a bone conduction kind of sensor that I'll be able to tell what's your voice from other voices so I guess we'll see if that works in the real world or not a quick little comparison here we talked about the weight before how they're uh they're newer and smaller and lighter than before and so that we're weighing 50 grounds here for the case and the buzz this is airpods Pro 56. 50 you know floods themselves 11 grams these ones 11 grams so it's actually the case that is lighter by six grams it's pretty amazing that they managed to achieve not just parody but they're smaller than the airpods case because this case is always the smallest when you compare it that's like the thing that they have that beats everybody else but somehow they finally did it and that is with uh 24 hours of battery life including the charge case eight hours continuous on the buds themselves and even though they shrunk these down the drivers inside here are actually bigger than they were before they're 8.4 millimeter drivers now instead of just six millimeter drivers on the XM Force price wise though the Sony's do cost fifty dollars more at 300 bucks airpods Pros are 250 now the comparable Bose quiet Comfort in-ears they're also 250 so you are going to be paying a premium for these but they're brand new all these other things have been out for a bit so conceivably the price will go down on these as well so overall the xm5s are definitely worth a close look they've improved the sound quality they've improved the noise canceling they've improved the size and the weight the these are just getting very close to being the best wireless earphones in the consumer Market definitely don't sleep on these put them in part of your roster if you're in that 250 to 350 dollar U.S budget for your wireless earphones they are worth a look so thanks for watching guys if

88,HGaYIZR9wDE,Sony WF-1000XM5 Review: The Highly Anticipated Sequel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGaYIZR9wDE,CNET, foreign folks I'm here with a product that a lot of people have been looking forward to Sony's new flagship wf-1000x Mark V noise canceling earbuds that list for 300 for 20 dollars more than the mark IVs those were great buds the xm4s and we gave them a CNET editors Choice Award when they came out two years ago but there's always room for improvement and with this new completely redesigned model Sony has addressed most of the small gripes people had with its predecessor are the mark 5S perfect not quite but overall they're really impressive easily among the top top earbuds on the market so let's dive right into the review to find out just how they're improved and how they stack up to the competition the first thing you'll notice about them is that they're smaller than the xm4s by about 25 percent and also 20 percent lighter according to Sony with each Bud weighing 6 grams by comparison the airpods Pro 2 weight 5.3 grams each their charging case is smaller to about 15 percent smaller and does have wireless charging capabilities I have both sets of earbuds here the mark IVs are a little big and while they fit my ears nicely they don't necessarily fit people with small ears well like co-worker Tara says she has smaller ears so I had her try both sets of buds and the smaller xm5s did work better for her should I do it this back into my ear this one's very sturdy in my ear and very lightweight as well the buds come in black or silver and are partially constructed from recycled materials the xm4s have a matte finish that I like in contrast these mix in a glossy finish there's a little apprehensive about it first but the outer part of the buds where the touch controls live has a matte finish so it doesn't pick up fingerprints I also appreciate that the buds don't stick out of your ears as much as their predecessors did one issue I had with the xm4s that hasn't been resolved is the ear tips that come with the buds which now include a set of extra small tips among the four options they should fit most ears just fine but they just don't quite give me the Tight Seal that you really need for optimal sound quality and noise canceling performance the tips are made out of a high-tech polyurethane foam material that's designed to conform to your ear canal and offer some attic grip so the earbuds stay in your ears more securely but their shape isn't quite right for my ears I need tips that are a little wider and rounder and I had to swap in a set of my preferred silicone tips that allow me to get a better seal it'd be nice Sony included a wider variety of tips but as I said the majority of you shouldn't have a problem with the ones you get and many of you should be able to get a secure enough fit to run with these they are ipx4 Splash proof and sweat resistant okay on to Features Sony's Flagship headphones and earbuds have always been loaded with features and these Mark 5 buds add some new feature upgrades to go along with the existing favorites like speak to chat a mode you can enable that automatically pauses your music and activates the headphones ambient mode when you start talking to someone ambient mode is similar to Apple's transparency mode but with these Sony's you can adjust the level of Ambient sound you want to let in all right I've got my music on here and then I'll start talking to my camera woman numi and if I want to have a conversation with her the music has completely paused I can hear the outside world I can talk to her and then as soon as I stop talking five seconds later the music comes back on I'm not gonna go through all the earbuds features in this video but I'll highlight the ones that stand out for me first you get multi-point Bluetooth pairing so you can pair the buds with two devices simultaneously and easily switch audio back and forth between them after that there are plenty of EQ settings to help tweak the sound and some adaptive sound modes plus support for hands-free Alexa that feature allows you to tap into Amazon's Voice Assistant without pressing anything on the buds also there's a new beta setting called find your equalizer that lets you choose between a series of EQ setting tweaks to find the sound you like best like the mark IVs these buds have ear detection sensors that pause your music when you take an earbud out yes you can use a single earbud if you want and resume playback when you put it back in but what's new is spatial audio with head tracking currently it's only available for Android users according to Sony and it's unclear if Apple users will ever get it but in my test it seemed to work a lot like Apple's spatial audio for video watching these are also compatible with the new le audio standards so in the future you should get access to features like aracast broadcast audio that would allow you for example to tap into an audio stream being broadcast from a certain TV at the gym while you're on a treadmill finally the mark 5 support Sony's ldac audio codec using ldac can get you slightly better sound quality if you're streaming high-res audio tracks from streaming services like Coba as in Tidal iPhone users get the AAC audio codec but a lot of Android phones support ldac if there's a feature that's missing it's some sort of find my buds feature built into the Sony headphones app the airpods Pro 2 have a Precision find my feature it really does come in handy at times as far as performance goes these do feel like a bump up from the xm4s though it's not a Quantum Leap they have new speaker driver units and three microphones in each bud and they're powered by two new proprietary Sony chipsets with more processing power the V2 integrated processor and the qn2e noise canceling processor Sony's been in a nip and Tuck battle with bows for the best noise canceling and Sony says these buds have the best toys canceling based on its tests it's not a huge upgrade over the noise canceling that the xm4s offer but it is a little more effective and is quite impressive overall like Bose's quiet Comfort earbuds 2 these buds are supposed to do a better job muffling a broader range of frequencies for my anecdotal testing they're right there with the Bose buds for noise canceling but it's hard to declare an outright winner the Bose also has great noise canceling there are also improvements to sound quality but again it's not a big bump up from the xm4s which already sounded excellent that said I thought the xm5s just sound a little cleaner with a little better bass definition everything's been tightened up a bit tonally they're a little warmer sounding than the airpods Pro 2 which also sound excellent for their size but the Sony's arguably have a slight Edge in tonal balance they're just a very pleasant set of earbuds to listen to and some of the best sounding earbuds out there right now as for voice calling Sony says you're getting its best ever call Quality the earbuds have bone conduction sensors that Sony says pick up the vibration of your voice directly from your skull bones helping to isolate your speech from ambient sounds and background noise for Clear calls even in loud environments I was generally impressed with the call Quality and noise reduction in particular but under harsher conditions a few callers did say my voice wobbled a bit here's a test call I recorded that gives you a sense of the call Quality though note that the call is recorded via the Internet so you lose a little bit of Fidelity in my voice all right I'm here on the streets of New York to do a test call with fellow editor John Falcone John had some uh some wind I got a bunch of traffic going by let me know how I sound you sound pretty good overall I would say there's a a bit of uh fuzziness and warbliness when you talk but otherwise especially when you're not talking um don't hear any background noise at all and uh it's generally Pretty good overall battery life is the same as what you get with the xm4s around eight hours on a single charge with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels and up to 12 hours with it off the case holds two extra charges that's a couple of hours better than what you get with the airpods Pro 2 which are around six hours so very good battery life overall as I said my intro these really are impressive earbuds though they're not perfect and I'm sure Sony will issue some firmware updates to fix some bugs and perhaps improve performance a bit but the key takeaway here is that Sony has managed to make its Flagship earbuds significantly smaller while actually improving upon performance with incremental upgrades noise canceling and sound quality and a slightly bigger upgrade to voice calling and for Android users anyway there's spatial audio with head tracking Apple users may find some advantages with the airpods Pro 2 whether it's from a fit or features perspective as I've said before the airpods Pro 2 are hard to beat for Apple users they sound great for their size and also offer excellent noise canceling and they are are being discounted to around 200 or 100 less than these I also like the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds 2 and the new Beats Studio buds plus which do cost significantly less but the wf-1000x mark fives really are the complete package particularly for Android users yeah you could quibble about them not including a wider variety of ear tips and maybe missing a feature or two and costing so much but they do largely live up to their hype so there is that but let me know what you think in the comments section and if you haven't subscribed to this channel already please do I'm David Carr for CNET thanks for watching,Sony

89,5Rmgj1jJUJI,Sony WF-1000XM5 Review | Best ANC Earbuds 2023!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rmgj1jJUJI,Tech Spurt, hello gorgeous peeps I'm Chris from techspurt and today we're going to be reviewing the fresh juice Sony wf-1000x Mark 5 true wireless earbuds you'll be able to stuff these sexy wee Pebbles into your ear holes from August as long as you have a spare 259 pounds to Chuck at Sony so cheap they certainly ain't but are they actually worth it well I've been testing out the Sony wfx the Sony wf-1000x Mark fives for about a month now still not used to that Bloody name this is my full review and for more on the latest in greatest Tech please do POG subscribe and ding that notifications Bell cheers now first up according to Sony the x mark 5S or 25 more Compact and 20 lighter compared with the previous generation as you can see they do still poke out of your locals a wee bit but nothing horrendous these young got those dangly drippy stem things makes it look like something suspect is leaking out of your ears and they certainly are like they feel really comfortable to wear I think around five to six hours was my longest stretch without taking the buds out of my ears no worries whatsoever no fatiguing that's not helped by the fact you've got these lovely foamy tips which which kind of mold themselves to the insides of your ears doesn't feel like they're pushing on the insides of your head or anything and suddenly it's now given you four different sizes of tip including the fresh new extra small ones just in case you've got a tiny wee head as with most true wireless earbuds these days you've also got a tip test inside of Sony's headphones app just to make sure you're definitely wearing the best possible set for your lugs I just open the medium tips I found that the buds did securely lodged inside of my lugs no matter how ferociously my head was vibrating and just to prove how good that fit is mosh test and both the buds and the case itself as well constructed from recycled Plastics so good on your Sony now when it's time to connect to your smartphone or your audio streaming device of choice while it's Bluetooth 5.3 of course as you would expect from a premium pair of true wireless earbuds that means that the Sony wf-1000x Mark 5S can connect to two devices at once and I've got to say I was ridiculously impressed with the stability of that connection even though I had the streaming set to prioritize an audio quality of a performance I heard next to no stumbles or Judds or anything even when I was in absolutely packed out train stations really busy Central London locations it was so close to Flawless it was unbelievable and Sony's headphones app is as always a bit of a cracker got pretty much all the features you could possibly want packed in here so you can quickly and easily check the battery levels and here is where you can prioritize either sound quality or stability you could also choose your preferred Voice Assistant I just left this on the Google assistant and in here is also where you customize the touch controls for the wf-1000 mark fives I actually just left these on the defaults because I found it worked really well quick tap of that left bud and you can toggle the noise cancellation mode and meanwhile add all the standard media controls assigned to the right bud and Sony also offer a repeat tap function as well which I haven't seen on any other buds that I've tested and yes you do have that auto pause feature as well when you rip a butt out of your lugs quite handy if you need to have a sudden conversation with someone and that transparency mode ain't gonna cut it and personally I found the touch controls are worked well you do get tonal feedback when you're tapping and poking away so you know that you're doing it right it's all very intuitive I didn't find there was any kind of learning curve or anything and I finally didn't accidentally activate those controls at all mostly because I wasn't really fiddling with the buds because they were just comfortable to wear and with that Google Assistant activated I got the usual merryweed chime in my ear every time a new notification popped up on my smartphone but the assistant could also announce exactly who it was who was messaging me if it was in the likes of what app you can even demand that the assistant reads out your messages aloud if you can't be bothered to pull your smartphone out of your pocket or bag or whatever you can even respond to messages right there and then so it's all super simple as for sound quality well do you even really need to ask to be fair the Sony wf-1000x Mark 5S pump out premium sound with minimal Distortion thanks to the dynamic driver X Tech and that high quality DAC you've got 24-bit audio signal processors of course these sorry buds supports high-res audio wireless of course you've got ldac support and if you've got any old low quality compressed tracks where you've got Sony's digital sound enhancement engine extreme to give them a bit of a boost clear them up a bit make them sound less CAC and I would necessarily say that I'm an audio file mostly because my hearing isn't particularly great anymore these days but I really appreciated being able to hear absolutely every little tiny wee element of every single track that I played especially more complex tracks you pick up on Little Bits that you just don't hear with other buds and Diving back into that headphones app I also really like Sony's audio profiling tool which could customize the audio it spots into your head based on your own hearing abilities and just general preferences a certainly nice and easy compared with a lot of these audio profiling tools all you do is play any song of your choice that you've got on your device and then when you start the audio profiler it'll pop up five Wii circles like this just tap each one and it will slightly tweak the sound to maybe enhance the bass a bit boost the highs let's skip on top of them test them out until you find the one that you definitely prefer and then hit next just repeat this a few times and then boom you've got your very own equalizer all set up in your behalf so you can enjoy the best possible sound oh and uh if you're into your immersive 360 degree reality audio experiences while Sony has now added head track and supports to these buds too now Sony is marketing the wf-1000xm5s as the best noise canceling true wireless earbuds and of course these Sony buds are renowned for been absolutely fantastic when it comes to cutting out all the crap that's going on all around you you got three mics on board These suck up all of that ambient noise and then you've got the integrated processor V2 as well as HD noise canceling processor qn2e which tick in all this data and then work their magic these processes then feed that data to Sony's Dynamic driver X which then produces the noise canceling waves there's loads of techie Jog and bollocks there but does it actually work and is it improved here on the mark fives well first of all those form tips are doing a lot of the work themselves as I said before they sort of mold themselves to fit the shape of your inner ear really have to block out a lot of the noise that's going on all around you but then when you knock on that ENC it has an extra impact on top leaving you in complete peace and bliss now don't get me wrong these buds can't work miracles they can't completely dampen out That Hideous screeching of the [ __ ] Northern line for instance but they can make it considerably more bearable which is good enough and so certainly is the best ENT that I've personally tested on any pair a true wireless earbuds if you fancy listed to a quiet podcast where you're sat next to a Motorway that is perfectly possible and also trains at all the usual fare as well they really help to cut down on the The Rumble the vibration so ideal for commuting and for traveling in general haven't had a chance to test them out in plane yet but hopefully that's coming soon and I found that there was next to no wind feedback at all as well so ideal if you live somewhere a bit Gusty or if you want a pair of true wireless earbuds to a rocking your ears while you're doing a bit of jogging or whatever and the Sony wf-1000 etc etc also boss improved call Quality thanks to those noise canceling smarts as you can hear the buds can clearly pick up on your voice helped by the born conduction sensor which actually knows when it's used Beacon and not somebody else nearby and the buds can then separate you from all live background bollocks but of course I'm just chatting away in assignment studio right now let's get some really loud obnoxious traffic sounds on the go and see how it fares with that okay so I'm now simulating being on a very busy High Street with lots of traffic trucks worn by a lot of angry porn honk and all that good stuff and as you can hear these Sony true wireless earbuds can still clearly and clearly pick up on my voice whichever unfortunate saw on busy chat and I can still hear exactly what I'm seeing so let's finish up this lovely Wii review of the Sony wf-1000x Mark 5s with a chat about the battery life and so many reckons you'll get around eight hours of use from these buds from a full charge and that is with the noise canceling switched on and I found in my personal test and that it wasn't far off but I tend to get just over seven hours from each of these buds on one occasion randomly the right bud did drain a lot faster than the left buds that died after more like five and a half six hours but that seemed to be a one-off touchwood thankfully probably just some quirky wee bug because I was of course reviewing these Sony buds pre-release yeah seven hours is a banging result for some true wireless earbuds and certainly great news if you do find yourself going on Long Journeys as for the case well that is proper we as I said before easy to slip into any pocket bag whatever when you're done with your buds or they do need a charge just pop them straight back in there you got the usual magnetic connection which holds them in there reasonably firmly I haven't had any problems with them popping out and flying across the floor or anything and check them in there for just about sort of four or five minutes you'll easily get a full hour of playback however one of the drawbacks of having such a diminutive case is the fact that the battery stuffed inside isn't exactly massive so you will only get around two full recharges of the buds before the case itself needs juicing up as well which thankfully you can either use type c USB otherwise it does charge wirelessly and there you have it my lovelies that is my full final Frank review of the Sony wf-1000 X Mark 5 true wireless earbuds after I've been tested them for around a month and I gotta say obviously I love them the design is slick the sound quality is fantastic and the noise cancellation well frankly Sony isn't [ __ ] about here it really is the best that I've personally tested at least in a pair of true wireless earbuds but the only real drawback for me is the fact that they're pretty bloody expensive 250-ish Queen not exactly affordable unless you're able to wipe your ass with 50 pound notes and if you're really tempted by the Sony's but you can't stretch to that sort of budget well you've got the likes of the Sound Cores which I recently reviewed which cost around 100 pounds just under and they still offer strong audio quality good noise cancellation they're not quite the same full range of features as the Sony's but pretty bloody close anyway that's what this ball Noble reckons what do you guys think I attempted by the Sony's or maybe you're watching this video a couple of months in the future you've actually got your own pair and you're absolutely loving them or not so much definitely check your review down in

90,MVQWrWLVoOM,Sony WF-1000XM5 Review - Smaller &amp; Lighter But Better?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVQWrWLVoOM,Matthew Moniz, so these are the brand new Sony wf-1000 xm5s terrible name so I'm just going to call them the xm5s and they've improved a lot with this new version compared to its old predecessor I think the best way to do this review is to compare it to the old xm4s add a little airpods Pro in there for contacts and same with the Beats fit Pro because I feel like that's the best way to kind of describe how these things function now right off the gate form factor they've absolutely nailed it it's a much smaller design in fact the actual case is about 15 smaller compared to the previous version you can tell automatically when I have them beside each other that it's not as thick and it's not as wide on top of that the earbuds which is probably the biggest change are 25 percent smaller compared to the previous version I don't know if you guys remember but the xm4s are super chunky when these things are in your ear it's literally like a growth sticking out the side of them the new versions just look a lot better not only are they smaller but they are also about 15 percent lighter so when you're wearing these things for long periods of time it's going to feel a lot more comfortable to wear but yeah big difference in terms of overall design now the case has had a few changes as well for example the front light on the old version is a long one and then on the new version It's a tiny little circle which tells you whether or not the headphones are charging or if they need to be charged also there's a little button on the back now which was something that wasn't present before so you can long press this and you can pair it to your phone whereas with the previous version you had to touch the sides of the earbuds in order to pair it with your device now obviously there's some technological updates to the new version they have this new dual core processor there's six microphones so it's going to be doing a better job of scanning the actual environment in order to provide active noise cancellation but they've also included an extra pair of ear tips in the Box you now get an extra small option in case you have really tiny earlobes that will fit those earlobes significantly better now here's a weird thing about these guys they are definitely a little bit more comfortable to wear but I do find that they're a bit more finicky when I was putting them in my ear and this really comes down to active noise cancellation with the older versions because they were so thick and they had this weird shape that kind of would I don't know rest in my earlobe I found that they weren't as finicky with active noise cancellation so even if the actual tip wasn't all the way in I could still get a decent active noise cancellation experience with the new version you have to stick them all the way in like I mean all the way in the seal has to be perfect or you will lose the effect of active noise cancellation whereas something like the airpods pro or even the Beats fits Pro if it's not all the way in I'm still going to get a good response from active noise cancellation and this is the weird thing okay active noise cancellation is supposed to be better on these new xm5s but I found them to be kind of equal to the xm4s I'm not seeing that much of an actual Improvement in fact out of all these buds on the table I still find that the airpods pro have the best active noise cancellation out of all four of these now if you're coming from the xm4 is you're going to be very familiar with how you control these earbuds the left earbud allows you to press it once if you want to cycle through active noise cancellation Ambient sound or turning them off if you tap it twice or three times you can access one of your quick access settings that you set up using your smartphone the Sony app will let you pair it to let's say Spotify for example if you want to load it up then if you tap it four times on the left hand side it will lower the volume once on the right earbud you have access to play and pause you tap it once to pause or pick up a call tap it twice to skip a song tap it three times to go back and then if you long press it you can access your assistant and if you tap it four times you can bring the volume up so identical I'm not the biggest fan of tapping it four times to increase the volume that's kind of very slow if you want want to increase the sound I'd rather just pull out my phone at that point but at least you have the option to do so the drivers have been improved the old xm4s had six millimeter drivers these ones have been bumped up to 8.4 and I think that's where these things Excel the most out of all these headphones on the table now don't get me wrong the old xm4s have great sound like they sound good but I found them to be the flattest out of the bunch not in a bad way but they were flatter than the other two and of course you could always equalize these tier tastes using the Sony app but right out of the box these xm5s had the best sound the airpods pro had probably put them in a very close second but these new 8.4 millimeter drivers definitely make a difference the other big thing that Sony was talking about was the Improvement to the microphones there are six microphones inside of here so not only that can have an advantage to basically helping with the environment in terms of scanning it to provide a better active noise cancellation experience but it's supposed to improve the actual voice quality so you guys let me know how these sound compared to the others in the comment section down below right now you're listening to the Sony wf-1000xm5s I do have the air conditioning blasting in the background which is very loud let me know if you guys can hear it also let me know how the sound quality compares to the other headsets that you hear in this video now you're listening to the airpods pro this is what the microphone sounds like with the airpods pro air conditioned still blasting let me know how the noise cancellation is on that but yeah now you're listening to the airpods pro and last up we have the Sony xm4s these are the older uh wireless headphones from Sony you guys let me know how the microphone quality is compared to the xm5s and more importantly whether or not you can hear the air conditioned blasting in the background now in terms of water resistance these are ipx4 so you can get splashes on them but you know you obviously can't soak these in a pool they will not work after a while but it is able to wirelessly charge just like the previous version they wirelessly charge by standing up where as with the airpods pro you have to lie it on its back so that's the only difference but just like the previous versions you can wirelessly charge the device in terms of actual battery life it's identical to the previous model you're going to get up to eight hours of use before needing to charge but the case will provide you up to 24 hours the only difference is that if you charge these for three minutes you'll get one hour of playback whereas with the previous xm4 you have to charge them for five minutes now I know one of the questions I'm going to get is are these headphones good for working out and personally I don't think they are I went to the gym with them I ran with them and because they don't have the little tips that the Beats fit Pro have I found that they had a tougher time staying in my ear and this was mostly true when I started sweating a lot because I run pretty far not pretty far at least far from me and after a while I'm sweating and I found that I was constantly adjusting these in my ear to stay in place now in all fairness this happened with the xm4s and it also happens with the airpods pro for my specific ear type I gotta have these tips or like the Powerbeats Pro where they kind of wrap around your ear so the big question should you buy the Sony xm5s look I like these things a lot they nailed the sound quality I find them to be the best out of the bunch but the active noise cancellation is not nearly as good as the airpods pro or even the Beats fits Pro for that matter and the Beats fits Pro work with both IOS and Android perfectly but the thing is this is priced at 299 that's more expensive than the Beats fit Pro and that's 50 more expensive than the airpods pro and I don't feel like these things are 50 dollars better my suggestion to you is to wait till these things go on sale before picking them up because right now they're priced a little bit too high and that's too bad because these are actually a very solid pick especially because the sound quality is really really good if you have any more questions let me know in the comment section down below like the video if you haven't already and I'll see you guys in the next one,Sony WF-1000XM5,The new Sony wf-1000 xm5s are 25 percent smaller compared to the previous version.They have a new dual core processor that is doing a better job of scanning the actual environment in order to provide active noise cancellation.They've also included an extra pair of ear tips in the Box you now get an extra small option in case you have really tiny earlobes that will fit those earlobes significantly better now.The airpods pro have the best active noise cancellation out of all four of these now. The old xm4s had six millimeter drivers these ones have been bumped up to 8.4.The Sony xm5s had the best sound the airpods pro had probably put them in a very close second.This is priced at 299 that's more expensive than the Beats fit Pro and that's 50 more expensive than the airpods pro.
91,tn5WPaQhv_U,Sony WF-1000XM5 Review | These New Sony Earbuds Are Crushing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn5WPaQhv_U,Digital Trends, how important to you are your wireless earbuds do you really know I thought I did but I mean if you lost them would you miss them a ton would you run out and replace them with the same model or would you maybe upgrade how much are you willing to spend on earbuds and what does any of this have to do with the new Sony wf-1000xm5 stick around and find out [Music] welcome back everyone I'm Caleb Dennison and I have a few stories for you today but they all tie into my review of the Sony wf-1000xm5 wireless noise canceling earbuds so to start from now on I'm just going to call them the xm5 and I'm gonna have to trust that you know I'm referring to these xm5s not these xm5s yeah Sony's model naming convention is another story but I'm afraid we don't have time for that right now before I go on if you're new around here welcome also if you're used to seeing TVs when you see my face well I also do earbuds and headphones and sound bars and slay dragons so sit back relax maybe grab a beverage and hey if you like what you learned today consider clicking some buttons of support that would also include shopping links in the description if you decide to buy anything that you see on this channel thanks a bunch okay the xm5 I'm going to tell a story later that explains why I'm just now reviewing these even though I've had them for a few weeks and they were announced a while ago so stick around for that but for now another story you may have seen me on this Channel singing the Praises of the Apple airpods Pro Gen 2 which I must admit is not a very Caleb thing to do but my take on the airpods pro Gen 2 is that they may not be the absolute best in a number of areas like sound quality battery life noise canceling call Quality but they are really good at all of those things plus they offer some specific appeal to those of us who own Apple devices I don't use a Macbook personally but I do use an iPad iPhone and Apple tv pretty frequently so for me the airpods pro gen into have been my default earbud my daily driver there fine I enjoy using them but I also really enjoy using other earbuds as well I'm lucky to get to try a bunch out and I can really appreciate the fun features of a set of jabras or the incredible sound quality of a set of sennheisers but when it comes to Sony earbuds I wasn't a big fan of the buds that these xm5s replaced that would be the xm4 Mostly because they were too bulky for me I think they were too bulky for a lot of people they sounded great and the noise canceling was excellent but the bulk kept me away from them actually it was the Sony linkbuds S that I fell in love with I didn't see that coming they didn't have noise canceling quite as good as the xm4 and the sound quality also wasn't quite on par with the xm4 but man they were comfortable and low profile I feel like they disappeared into my ears as well as any earbud could and they never fell out I didn't need to adjust them a bunch I just I found myself using them all the time so you can imagine my disappointment when I lost them yep of the almost 100 earbuds that I've tested and used I've never lost any of them until the link buds S I was super bummed I thought about buying another pair of those but ultimately I figured you know what Sony is going to come out with something new soon and I'll give those a go that would be these the xm5 and they are almost exactly what I was hoping for all the sound quality and noise canceling power of the xm4 in a form factor more like the link buds s that I love more compact for sure but not quite as comfortable or low profile as the link buds s so why tell you my little lost earbuds sob story well because wireless earbuds are now incredibly common they are practically a commodity there are a ton of options to choose from and in fact some of them are surprisingly affordable take the anchor Liberty 4 NC for example 100 bucks and they do everything awesome but you know what I'm not gonna buy those because I don't like the stem style earbud it's just not for me the airpods pro Gen 2 that stem is the one thing I don't really care for but I'm able to overlook it some folks love that look on the airpods pro gen 2. I know it's almost become sort of a status symbol but frankly it's just not for me so if you're like me you will pay a bit more to get exactly what you want as long as what you are getting is indeed exactly what you want and xm5 are going to be exactly what a lot of folks want why well in the most simplest of terms this is going to be a huge review Redux okay the xm5 are everything you'd love about the xm4 and nothing you didn't love class leading sound quality class leading noise canceling class leading Voice or call Quality excellent battery life it's all here but in more compact attractive and comfortable package so the new xm5 are an easy 9 out of 10 for me with that said I don't think they're going to be for everyone especially if you have smaller ears because despite being more Compact and more like just a button that you put in your ear they are still just a tad bit bulky I still miss the link buds S size and shape maybe all the tech that are in the xm5 can't go in a package that's small yet I get it but the xm5 are a bit bigger than the link buds s and for me don't stay perfectly seated at all times with no adjustment necessary so those are the only reasons these don't get a perfect 10. I think what really stands out about the xm5 here is the call Quality from the Fidelity of your voice to the background noise canceling these tests did better than the airpods pro gen 2. I took a call with Simon Cohen my buddy that does most of our earbuds and headphone reviews and the xm5 were the clear winner not sure I can duplicate that for you here but I'm going to try using iPhone's voice memo app so here's what the airpods pro Gen 2 sound like inside with no real background noise it's probably a fairly familiar sound though they may be getting a little bit of a boost since I'm using them with an iPhone and these are the Sony xm5 now indoors we found the xm5 had better voice Fidelity on the whole but when I step outside into the noise it's a slightly different story okay so this is a sound you're probably familiar with these are the airpods pro gen 2. there's nothing wrong with them I imagine that you can hear me just fine and a lot of the background noise at this busy intersection is probably being tamped down on quite a bit but watch what happens when I switch to the xm5 okay so I've switched to the Sony xm5 and I don't know exactly what my iPhone's voice recorder is going to capture but hopefully you get a good feel for the difference in the Fidelity between the airpods Pro 2 and the xm5 also hopefully we get a little bit of a different sense for what kind of background noise cancellation is happening right now there is certainly plenty of noise happening around me right now but the ultimate test is about to happen I'm about to take a uh a video conference meeting here on this corner like in 30 seconds so I'll let you know how that goes I'll see you in just a second so as you probably heard while the voice Fidelity takes a little bit of a hit outside with lots of noise to cancel the xm5 do a much better job hiding my surroundings from the collar on the other end of the line I took that meeting out there and nobody had any idea I wasn't sitting right here the whole time I think that's a pretty great endorsement oh also wind noise it's not a worry with the xm5 I had 20 mile per hour gusts coming at me when I spoke to Simon and he couldn't hear a thing out of the ordinary as for noise canceling I used the xm5 on a flight out to the east coast and back a couple of weeks ago and the ANC was outstanding when I played movies or music sick I couldn't hear anything else and if you want to take a nap with these in your ears no problem they are just low profile enough not to bother your ear if you lean it against a pillow or a bulkhead I don't think I would wear them to bed all the time but if you're just beat you can definitely quiet things down and grab yourself a nap the sound quality for music and movies is excellent it's very much in line with Sony's XM series of full-size headphones just more in your head so to speak I still think Sennheiser has an edge in the sound quality department for audiophiles but I would never balk at the xm5 earbuds they sound excellent now I'm gonna intentionally gloss over a ton of features that Sony builds into its best headphones all accessible and manageable through its headphones app yes you can have them adapt the ANC to match what you're doing so if you're sitting still you get full ANC if you're walking around downtown they back off the ANC so that you can hear any danger coming around the corner they also have a feature that when you speak will pause the music and put the buds into transparency mode and it works better than ever you can see me using it right here when I'm buying some plants and that face you're seeing right there is me freaking out over a hundred and eighteen dollars for these two plants yikes anyway my lawnmower and vacuum used to trigger this feature which was frustrating because that's when I wanted the ANC and music the most but now the software seems to be better trained to detect the voice and not just loud sounds coming at them my only complaint is that if you already have your music paused and transparency mode is on the earbuds still do this annoying chime to let you know they're going into speaking mode but you know what there are more annoying things in life the xm5's transparency mode by the way is just fine it is not as good as apples which is the closest thing I've heard to not wearing earbuds or headphones at all but to be fair nobody can compete with Apple's transparency mode the xm5 are as good as any other competitor out there probably a little bit better so guys I think the xm5 are for anyone who does a lot of travel a lot of phone calls especially for business and wants really great sound quality as well someone who wants the best of the best and is willing to pay a premium for something that's going to last a long time and not be outclassed by another product the very next year now if you find some of what I'm saying surprising because you have seen less glowing reviews elsewhere well understand this the first round of reviews you may have watched or read on these earbuds were of prototypes they were not based on the final version of these earbuds Sony kind of made a gaff and sent a bunch of prototypes out to reviewers and didn't mention that they were prototypes so a lot of reviewers didn't even know until they got a little note from Sony along with some replacement buds probably don't have to tell you not Sony's finest hour but now that the final version is out and I've been able to test these earbuds for a while I'm confident in saying they are among the very best you can buy they ask a premium price but they deliver an experience that's Head and Shoulders above most of the competition you definitely get what you pay for and then some I strongly recommend them especially if you're discovering that your earbuds are far more important to you than you previously thought thanks as always for watching everyone what do you think of the xm5 are there some other earbuds you'd like for me to review let me know down in the comments please consider liking and subscribing I'll see you on the next one and until then here's two other videos I think you might like [Music],Sony WF-1000XM5,Review of the Sony wf-1000xm5 wireless noise canceling earbuds.I wasn't a big fan of the buds that these xm5s replaced that would be the xm4.They are almost exactly what I was hoping for for all the sound quality and noise canceling power of the xm4 in a form factor. The Xm5 comes in at a competively price of $100.The Xm5 has better voice quality than the airpods pro gen 2.Despite being more Compact and more like a button that you put in your ear they are still just a tad bit bulky. The ANC was outstanding when I played movies or music sick I couldn't hear anything else.If you want to take a nap with these in your ears no problem they are just low profile enough not to bother your ear if you lean it against a pillow or a bulkhead.The only complaint is that if you already have your music paused and transparency mode is on the earbuds still do this annoying chime to let you know they're going into speaking mode.
92,vPFM8x1LzwI,Sony WF-1000XM5 Review in FIVE Minutes!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPFM8x1LzwI,SoundGuys, if you don't have time to watch a full review don't worry because we've got you covered and in this video we're going to tell you everything you need to know about the Sony wf-1000xm5 in five minutes first thing you need to know about these earbuds is that they are a lot more comfortable than the wf-1000xm4 not only are these smaller and lighter than its predecessor but it's only has also redesigned the internal structure of the ear tips and now that the ear tips are more flexible you don't have to jam and twist the earbuds into your ear to get a secure fit or a proper seal oh and if you got extra small ears don't worry because Sony has finally okay I lost them but Sony has finally included extra small ear tips for extra small ears so good for you wait why didn't we why did we pick a gray carpet and why did they send us the gray color along with the new ear tips comes improved isolation and on top of that the xm5 the earbuds now feature the best ANC performance out of any true Wireless earbud we have ever tested that's right according to our extensive objective testing process the xm5 earbuds do have better ANC performance than the xm4s the airpods pro Gen 2 and even the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro and if you want to see our full measurements then stay tuned for our ultimate review of the Sony wf-1000xm5 but if you're impatient then you can keep our results at soundguys.com now the xm5 earbuds also include improved touch controls that's right in the previous generation you had to choose between controlling either listening mode toggle or volume control in one earbud for the xm5 Sony has pulled a Hannah Montana and of giving you the best of both worlds meaning that you can control both listening modes and volume just from one earbud and you don't have to go into the app to customize the controls now the full list of touch control patterns are going to be available on our website or in this freeze frame in three two one speaking of customization like with most if not all Sony audio products the xm5s have great app support via the Sony headphones Connect app now downloading the app is key for getting firmware updates but it is also important for unlocking a lot of the earbuds features like adaptive sound control Ambient sound control DSE Extreme Audio upscaling and you're also going to need the app if you want to use Sony 360 reality audio which is the company's proprietary spatial audio technology next thing you need to know about the xm5s is that they've got great battery life now Sony claims that you can get eight hours on a single charge in up to 24 hours with a charging case but from our testing the xm5s actually exceeded Sony's claims and provided us with 9 hours and 32 minutes of playback that's enough battery life for a transatlantic flight between New York and London and you would still have extra battery for when you land in London the headphones also come with quick charging worth just three minutes of charging will give you about an hour's worth of playback now from our tests the three minute quick charging got us closer to 50 minutes of playback time which is still not bad if you need your earbuds for a quick workout now people complain that the xm4 has had too much bass emphasis and unfortunately the story isn't any better with the xm5s from hard testing the xm5s actually had a higher emphasis in the mid bass region which is why it sounds like cellos kick drums and bass since might sound a little louder than you'd expect and if you're a fan of EDM or hip-hop or you're someone like me who enjoys a little extra bass when pushing B then you're gonna love the xm5 but for those who prefer a little less low end then I recommend going into the headphones Connect app and turning down the clear bass slider in the EQ by a few notches now Sony also claims that the xm5's microphones is the best that's ever included in a pair of true wireless earbuds now this is apparently thanks to the six micro A3 per each side and also through a combination of AI processing and bone conduction technology which should provide better voice detection and therefore better filtering of outside noise while you're on a call unfortunately we were not able to properly test that because we were given a pre-production unit and the microphone on this one one is not good but we will be getting a production unit soon to test so again if you want to see our full mic test be sure to stay tuned for our ultimate review coming soon now if you own the wf-1000xm4 you're probably wondering should you upgrade to the xm5 well if you were someone like me who found the fit of the xm4 very uncomfortable then yes by all means upgrading the xm5 is a good idea but if you're thinking about upgrading based on sound quality or ANC performance I would hold off just because of how much an upgrade would cost you more on that later but you're probably also wondering are these any better than the airpods pro Gen 2 the answer is yes the xm5s do feature better ANC performance better software customization support and it plays nicely with Android devices but if you want the best out of the box sound quality and you want the most comfortable fit and you're an Apple user then yeah I'd actually still recommend the airpods pro Gen 2 over the xm5 and if you want to get your hands on the Sony wf-1000xm5 it will cost you around 300 US dollars to get these buds which is is quite a lot of cheddar for a pair of true Wireless noise canceling earbuds in fact at this price point the xm5s are more expensive than the airpods pro Gen 2 Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro and even the Google pixel buds Pro otherwise if you are looking for one of the best active noise cancellation true wireless earbuds then you won't be disappointed with the Sony wf-1000xm5 and that is time okay we did it that's pretty much it well if you enjoyed the format make sure to let us know in the comments down below or like and if you really did like the format make sure to hit like subscribe and I will see you guys in the next video happy listening,Sony WF-1000XM5,The Sony wf-1000xm5 are smaller and lighter than their predecessor.The earbuds feature the best ANC performance out of any true Wireless earbud we have ever tested.The xm5s also include

93,gPkxuSnXmb8,The DEFINITIVE Sony WF-1000XM5 Review &amp; Comparison by an AUDIO ENGINEER,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPkxuSnXmb8,This is Tech Today, as an audio engineer with over 16 years of experience mixing for concerts bands and events my goal and responsibility is to make the most insane audio review on all of YouTube so this is a definitive and experiential comparison of the Sony wf-1000xm5s the Sony wf-1000xm Force the Apple airpods Pro 2 and the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too and it's measured and captured with over five thousand dollars of high-end professional equipment that covers the entire human hearing range to help you make the best choice for your preferences now since this is an experiential and immersive review you'll want to make sure that you're wearing earbuds or headphones in both ears in order to get the full experience so I'll let you do that before we continue now these high quality recordings will not magically transform your listening device to them but they do provide the comparative differences between all of them for ANC transparency mode gaming performance call Quality and microphone quality in various situations and will listen to a variety of different musical styles I'll even let you hear my custom EQ settings for the Sony xm5s which you can gain access to by becoming a channel member so let's hear some of what it sounds like if you're wearing these earbuds and listening to music and each test in this video will start and end with the original reference track and then cycle through each earbud you'll see which earbud you're listening to by looking in the label up top foreign [Music] [Music] by the way just so you understand the flow of this video we'll listen to a song sample between each section of this video there are also chapters available so you can easily find your way around I promise that you'll come away feeling confident about which option is the best fit for your preferences of course if you want to purchase any of these there'll be links Down Below in the description and it does help support the channel if you use those links now if you're wondering why I'm emphasizing the xm5 so much it's not because I'm biased it's because it's the new thing at the time of filming so chill out for the song listen to the Reverb for the vocals the snare the sharpness of the hi-hat and the stereo spread from the Wawa sounds and let me know in the comments what you notice [Applause] [Music] you guys [Music] Sony has recently moved towards more sustainable materials and shrieking down the size of their products which we first started to see with the Sony link buds s this is a nice change from the massive wf-1000xm3s of the past they even managed to be even smaller than the xm4's case and slightly bigger than the linkbud's S case amongst the four the Apple airpods Pro 2 are the smallest with the Bose QuietComfort earbuds 2 being the largest I do really like the texture and feel of the xm5s but just a heads up that the case is prone to scuffs and marks but so far I've been able to wipe them off you may not see this as much on the black model but the black model will show more fingerprints so I prefer the silver or white color the xm5 also adds a pairing button to the case which the xm4 lacked which is definitely appreciated the airpods Pro 2 case is a bit more feature-rich because it has a speaker inside of it that can provide audible feedback and sounds so if you lose them and are looking for them that can come in handy it also has an air tag built into it so you can use the find my network to locate it one thing that I don't particularly like is how the earbuds themselves are partially glossy strangely the xm5s are insanely slippery and hard to get out of the case actually dropped it oh there you go a slippery little Goose but I got it while the airpods Pro 2 are glossy the earbuds are super easy to take out because you push from the back to take it out it's so easy that can just open it up without even looking grab it and put it in my ear on the xm5s this motion doesn't seem to be the intended motion nor does it work well because there's nothing to grip on now as you can see the xm5s are a little bit bigger than the bulb part of the airpods Pro 2 but notably smaller than the xm4s and the Bose QuietComfort earbuds too now this is not only obvious visually but also in your ear and how they feel now they feel pretty comfortable for me so that's my personal experience but my ears are not the same as yours the xm4s feel massive in your ears in comparison to the rest the Bose feel super secure because of the extra fins the airpods Pro 2 surprisingly feel like they're not in your ears without falling out and the xm5s feel secure while being very comfortable but it's important to know that it's mostly relying on the ear tip to hold it in for working out all of them are ipx4 rated I think the bows are the most secure option out of all of them but I haven't found any issues with any of the others in terms of feeling like they fall out or them actually falling out now having the proper size ear tip is important not only for the sound but to keep it secured in your ear the xm5s joined the trend of having an extra small ear tip and are made out of a really nice foam-like material rather than silicone so it not only provides a more snug fit but also a stronger passive noise cancellation unfortunately the xm5 stick out of my ear enough to make it uncomfortable to lay down on a pillow strangely though the airpods Pro 2 are quite comfortable when laying down even with that stem at least for my ears for the song pay attention to the clarity of the attack of the acoustic guitar strings but how Ford the mid-range is in the body of the guitar and the vocals when the nights get cold sometimes when I look over see you by a fire with your hands out in the open and I wonder if you're singing Autumn's song but if I'm singing all I must be singing on my own [Music] oh look we're in the maxim5 how weird as for battery life here's a helpful chart to look at that will show you that they're pretty much all the same with the airpods pro having the largest overall battery life and the Sony's having the longest per charge battery life as a whole all of them are at least long enough for a long flight with ANC on or to get through most of a workday and they have been fairly accurate in my actual use I honestly have no complaints about any of their battery lives all these charge quickly but the xm5s can get you an hour of playback time with a three minute charge compared to the xm4's 5 minutes and all but the airpods Pro 2 use USBC at the time of filming there have been some rumors that the airpods Pro 2 will have a refresh to swap out the lightning port for USBC so if that's true and you're watching that and it has been released how do you like it let me know in the comments hello you from the future in addition to charging over a cable all of them have wireless charging except for the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too this is a bit of a frustrating Omission given that it is a flagship earbud from Bose and they have the largest case with the airpods Pro 2 it benefits from magsafe and will likely benefit from the qi2 charging standard coming in 2024 and that includes magnets that are essentially magsafe that means it will be compatible with a lot of wireless charging accessories that will be released in 2024 and Beyond hey by the way if you found this video valuable and want to help support the making of more of them the super thanks feature is enabled it's like giving you a tip thanks this track is quite revealing in how the mid-range is handled between each earbud as well as how it handles some of the higher end things like symbols in the snare pay attention to see if you hear one of them being a bit harsher than the other hold it to the night [Music] [Applause] [Music] for the xm5s interactions are mostly the same with the addition of a four tap feature to either turn your volume up or down which is greatly appreciated I think volume control is a make or break for me there are options for adjusting which earbud handles Ambient sound control and which handles playback control in the app unfortunately it doesn't allow you to assign custom actions for each type of tab so you're stuck with predefined presets overall I'm happy with the interactions on the xm5s but I prefer the swipe gestures found on the airpods Pro 2 and the Bose QuietComfort earbuds too which allow for swipe volume controls up and down on each earbud it just feels more intuitive over Taps and it's nicer for those of us that wear one earbud at a time as for connectivity the airpods Pro 2 are obviously amazing for Apple devices with quick pair and the Sony earbuds connect over Android fast pair and support the higher quality ldac codec on Android and Bose requires an app to work properly I will say that the Bose app is the worst part of that earbud because it's so inconsistent doesn't always work and it won't let you connect at times so Bose needs a fixed repairing process and connectivity and use Android fast here the xm5s have 85 percent of the features available just from connecting over Bluetooth and the interactions so the app isn't required for a good experience but the headphone app is essentially the same as before with ANC and transparency controls EQ adaptive sound controls based on what you're doing speak of the chat which will auto switch to transparency mode when it detects your voice and back to ANC when you stop talking a new head gesture feature which you cannot to accept a call or shake your head to reject it interesting there's also Multi-Device pairing which works fantastically well and there's a bunch more as a whole the Sony app is solid but wish I had more custom EQ bands beyond the five given for people like me as well as more granular controls for interactions I also would like more side tone control or the capture voice during a phone call feature that is intended to prevent you from feeling all plugged up into your head isolated from when you're talking on a call right now it doesn't feel like it's doing nearly enough to alleviate this sensation speaking of calls and microphones let's check that out after this next song this song is a mid-ranging warm and Soulful track listen to her vocals the electric guitar lines and the keyboard okay and together [Music] [Applause] [Music] in your mouth [Music] now let's test out how the microphones perform inside where it's quiet and outside in noisier areas anyways we'll also check out the call Quality experience and to help financially support videos like this I'll test out the mics while telling you how you can support me now I don't have a sponsor for this video because a whole bunch of Brands pass on it which I just have a feeling a lot of them will wish they had you can still help support videos like this that take me over 60 hours to make by checking out the service that I personally use called delete me I had a pretty scary experience a year or so ago where I was live streaming and someone started to share personal information about me in the chat and even started to share details of where I live I thought I was about to be swatted which terrified me it was one of the most violating feelings I've ever had and I just proactively called the police to let them know what's happening to try to you know prevent anything from happening they said that they would have to show up regardless if someone was to report something so I was a bit anxious but thankfully nothing happened and after that I made sure that it would never happen again you see I had this previous job at JP Morgan Chase in the fraud prevention department and my job was to find information on people let me tell you there's way too much information out there about you if you've opened up a phone plan about a house voted opening utility plan or numerous other things your information is out there here's the crazy part public information is way too public in the age of the internet I could easily find out someone's current and previous address their phone number family members age and More in as little as five minutes with only two pieces of information about you like your name and what city you live in so what's the solution well first we need some serious reform in regards to public information and second you can easily remove all that information with delete me it provides all the information that you provide and yes it is safe and then it uses that information and looks all over the Internet for those who are selling your information and sharing it and request that it's removed every single three months I tell my family and friends to use it my fellow content creators and I'm telling you that you should use it too I've been using it for the past year and I can't even find my personal information on the internet and I'm me it was my job to find people if you sign up with you'll get 20 percent off a plan and I'll get a little commission to help compensate for my lack of sponsors and here's a tip sign up for the two-year plan to extend that discount even longer that's what I did so help a brother out sign up and protect yourself your friends and your family using the link in the description or the QR code on the screen thanks to the real ones who signed up shared my link and helped support videos like this by the way all these phone calls were HD phone calls now we're next to a waterfallon which provides a lot of noise that the mics will have to filter out to focus on your voice how does it sound on the Bose now Sony told me that they added an AI chip and some sensors into the xm5s to tell when you're talking and this is based on the vibrations that it detects while you're talking and then that AI chip processes all that crazy stuff so in theory that means it should be able to filter out your external noise and capture the sound of your voice better so how do you do it and now we're next to a busy road as if you're walking to work I'm running things to say if I want to let you know that I'm really thankful that you're here I hope you're having a good day and that you're enjoying the video so far and that providing a lot of value here if it is let me know what you think in the comments I'll let you notice about each of the microphones and how they perform no this song has a lot of frequencies going everywhere so listen to how the high end and the mid-range changes between earbuds foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] generally using bluetooth earbuds isn't the best idea for games especially first person shooters or rocket League or you know things like that but they can be perfectly fine for most other games Sony has stated that they have improved their latency on the xm5s which is true but still has a bit of a delay the Bose is the worst in terms of latency and the airpods Pro 2 on an iPhone performs the best for this next song listen to the low end and the high end From The Snare and especially the hi-hats to hear how bright and sharp the high ends [Music] what's going on [Music] transparency mode is an extremely helpful feature that allows you to be aware of and engage with your surroundings without having to take out your earbuds and every one of these have varying levels of quality and can be enabled by a touch of a button an adjustment in the app or automatically enables when you talk like on the xm5s transparency has been a very exciting area of improvement over the last year with the launch of the airpods Pro 2 and the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds too these two have been the best options out there for transparency due to how natural they sound the question is how do they stack up with each other and how does the xm5 compare so we have some very fancy microphones here each one of these mice is a thousand dollars so you'll actually be able to hear how it sounds in terms of the transparency performance and the ANC performance compared to just saying hey it sounds good or sounds bad we'll be able to have some objective samples of how they're actually performing in different environments which is really cool okay let's do a transparency test right next to this water fountain foreign [Music] foreign [Music] okay now we're next to this busy road so let's see how it performs [Music] [Applause] [Music] now what's really interesting about transparency mode on the Bose QuietComfort earbuds 2 and the airpods Pro 2 is that the sound of your environment when you have in your ear kind of sounds a lot like the same as when you take it out there's no audible difference in volume there which is really convenient it adds to that really natural experience for transparency mode this song is from my personal friend Hannah Parrott listen to how Dynamic the track sounds the various layers of horns string sections and malloc percussion instruments [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you for many years Sony has been amongst the best out there for ANC or active noise cancellation going neck and neck with other brands like Bose and Apple so this test will be really fun to check out now for the ANC test we're next to this wire phone let's see how they perform [Music] now not all ANC is the same sometimes it's just a marketing point and it doesn't really do much or it does a lot and it's really effective like the options that we have in this video and some of them have different approaches some may focus more on the mid-range reduction which is where your voice tends to kind of reside or we'll focus more on the high end where you have a lot of ambient noise or things like water running so it really comes down to your personal preference and the approach that you prefer all right now we're out in an open field where there's a bunch of white noise and so we're going to try out the transparency mode and we have my friend Sydney over here that's going to help out with some of the talking samples hey oh listen to how each handles win how much of the voice you can hear in a and C mode and how clear and natural The Voice Sounds in transparency mode what's up Sydney what's going on Brandon aren't we like in Rome or something we are almost like Rome but not as cool Sydney have you ever seen the Bose quite go for earbuds too no this is actually my first time seeing these bad boys do you think uh it's kind of weird with the stubbies oh yeah it's like give me a thumbs up Sydney what do you think about the design of the xm5s I love it uh it's cool it's you know what I'm more fascinated with than the xm5s is just your entire testing setup you're you know it's classic you oh thanks you're a classy guy now the song is covered with a wide range of frequencies so listen to the high end and the mid-range for how it changes between earbuds [Music] ways [Music] now as you've probably noticed I haven't really shared a lot of my thoughts on the sound quality that's to give you more time to hear for yourself the objective samples and make your own conclusions but I know a lot of you want to hear my personal thoughts so here they are the Sony wf-1000xm5s really surprised me at first listen they sound good typically Sony's go for a very dark bass heavy sound that some have described as feeling like you're under a thick blanket this is not the case here the xm5s may be Sony's most balanced sounding wireless earbuds today avoiding the much darker and more congested Bassy sound that was found on the wf-1000xm4s it is still a bit more mellow and less Airy than the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too in the airpods Pro 2 which some may prefer however it doesn't sound so mellow that becomes boring or muffled I assume you've been able to hear these differences in the song samples amongst the lineup the airpods Pro 2 are a bit closer to the standard called the harman curve that provides a Target sound that most people tend to prefer according to harman's research I tend to prefer a Harmon sound with some minor modifications so the airpods Pro 2 have been my preference for a while for wireless bluetooth earbuds but that changes with xm5s plus my custom EQ now the Sony headphones app does have an interesting feature that gives you the ability to create a custom EQ based upon some predetermined sound so you kind of tap around and choose what option you prefer and it continually narrows it down until you get a custom EQ personally I didn't really like the results of those but thankfully there is a five band EQ option that you can mainly arrange to get a more granular choice for you so I prefer that one a little bit more now speaking of custom EQ let me share with you my own after this song this song has a lot of Reverb going on listen to how forward the vocal sound the air and the Reverb from the vocals and how clean the low end sounds and let me know what you notice in the comments [Music] I need [Music] foreign [Music] with my custom EQ I still have to take the blanket off the sound and adjust the high end to give it more clarity and air and I was able to obtain more instrument separation a wider sounding Sound Stage more elevated and present vocals and a tighter more Punchy low end to be honest with my kasamiku this is my favorite sounding Warehouse earbuds out there with good ANC now unfortunately I can't show you the examples I want to do to copyright but can really hear the differences with my custom EQ on songs like Daft Punk's the game of love that has a lot of air and punchiness electric mantises Rose City for the expanded Sound Stage and Silent planets pinopathicon for a more aggressive sounding electric guitar and growling bass to name a few you can gain access to my custom EQ for the xm5s along with other headphones and earbuds by becoming a channel member and hitting that join button your support helps me put together videos like this that take me over 60 hours to make a whole week full of tuning and experimentation for the EQ and the ability to purchase the equipment and products to make content like this I even have special EQ for the wavelet app for those on Android for even more fine-tuned custom EQ that I think sounds even better and it's what I'm personally using while on Android now let's hear a sample of how the custom EQ sounds it may be a bit harder to hear the difference here compared to listening with the rear earbuds in your ears but pay attention to how mellow the vocals and symbols sound on the default EQ and how the custom EQ makes it a bit clearer and more punchy this is nothing to do me I'm about to lose my mind cause when I see you I really think I need you every single summer time seasons in between now the question is which one should you buy well if you are using an iPhone it's really hard to argue with the fact that there are a lot of ecosystem benefits that come with the Apple airpods Pro 2. if you want wires charging don't get the bows as for active noise cancellation it's pretty close between these two but I would say that in my observations it seems like the xm5 is the best one if you need the longest per charge option get either of the Sony's and if you need the longest overall battery life go with the airpods pro 2. as for transparency mode I think it's a toss-up between the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too and the airpods pro too there are slight variances that may be there because your ear shape but yeah it's not that big of a deal if you want the best microphone that removes all of your surroundings the xm5 may be an awesome but I've noticed that it puts a lot in that environment I talked to Sony about this and they believe that it was an issue with the pre-production table that they gave me and it wouldn't be a few on retail use we'll have to verify that in the later video but for now that may be a deal breaker and I do have to say that the airpods Pro 2 sound really good on a Mac as for comfort in size it's really hard to argue with the airpods Pro 2 they feel like they're hardly in your ear but I will say that the xm5s they're pretty dang comfortable they're a really good upgrade from the xm4s and quite a bit more comfortable than the Bose if you want the best sound get the xm5s with my custom EQ or the airpods pro 2. as a whole the xm5s is a huge upgrade from the xm4 so if you have an xm4 earbud and you're looking to upgrade it's totally a no-brainer if you haven't purchased one yet don't even bother with the X and forces worth the extra price because there are so many advancements here that make it quite amazing from the size the way it feels the active noise cancellation the transparency mode that's so much it's a great upgrade from the xm4s but if you're not using the iPhone the xm5s may be the best option as for pricing surprisingly the airpods Pro 2 are cheaper than the Bose and the xm5s but you can find the xm4s for a cheaper price but I would not really choose this so for any of the other options this next song has a killer base on it pay attention to that the synth and the vocal Reverb and don't forget to use the links Down Below in the description if you want to purchase any of these [Music] here forever [Music] so which one do I prefer this is kind of an interesting question to ask because it really depends on which platform I'm using at the time I tend to use two phones at the same time Android and iOS so if I'm using an iPhone it's really hard to deny that the airpods Pro 2 are just like really great because of all the ecosystem benefits that find my feature the mag safe all that is really nice but you know if I'm using an Android phone I really like the xm5s these are probably going to be my go-to especially with my custom EQ it gets it just that sound that I really prefer and the active noise cancellation is really amazing the transparency mode not exactly the best amongst all of them but I can live with it and they're quite comfortable I love the battery life on it and it still has wireless charging unlike the Bose now thanks so much to Sony for sending out the xm5s for an unbiased review that did not have any sort of review writes or copy approval and they're seeing at the same time as you now how about some outtakes in the app to get oh God oh my God where how many do I have another nice thing about having a shooter is that weird you like really dumb stuff and like nerdy stuff like this if you don't like go around thinking you're some weirdo they're like oh they're just filming a thing so you know if you want to do like socially unacceptable and weird things just have a guy film it okay up the sensors you know tape is a lot better than neat airpods that had to use meat it's got a bunch of tea you know that's the cleanup that's happening oh he's taking it away oh hopefully that's not gonna just die somewhere on the carpet airpods Pro again take two it was like metal music and I was like that's not right I'm a metal metal,Sony WF-1000XM5,This is a definitive and experiential comparison of the Sony wf-1000xm5s the Sony wf-1000xm Force the Apple airpods Pro 2 and the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds.It's measured and captured with over five thousand dollars of high-end professional equipment that covers the entire human hearing range.Each test in this video will start and end with the original reference track and then cycle through each earbud you'll see which earbud you're listening to. The extra fins the airpods Pro 2 surprisingly feel like they're not in your ears without falling out and the xm5s feel secure while being very comfortable but it's important to know that it's mostly relying on the ear tip to hold it in for working out all of them are ipx4 rated.The bows are the most secure option out of all of them but I haven't found any issues with any of the others in terms of feeling like they fall out or them actually falling out now having the proper size ear tip is important not only for the sound but to keep it secured in The xm5s have 85 percent of the features available just from connecting over Bluetooth.The headphone app is essentially the same as before with ANC and transparency controls EQ adaptive sound controls based on what you're doing speak of the chat which will auto switch to transparency mode when it detects your voice and back to ANC when you stop talking a new head gesture feature which you cannot to accept a call or shake your head to reject it. In this video we test the Xm5 against the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds and the Sony airpods Pro 2 on an iPhone. transparency mode is an extremely helpful feature that allows you to be aware of and engage with your surroundings without having to take out your earbuds.This test will be really fun to check out now for the ANC test and how each handles win how much of the voice you can hear in a and C mode. The Sony wf-1000xm5s sound good typically Sony's go for a very dark bass heavy sound that some have described as feeling like you're under a thick blanket.The xm5s may be Sony's most balanced sounding wireless earbuds today avoiding the much darker and more congested Bassy sound that was found on the wf-1000xm4s.The Sony headphones app does have an interesting feature that gives you the ability to create a custom EQ based upon some predetermined sound.

94,C0Ff_ee5Jkg,These Were MADE For Me! - 1MORE Evo Earbuds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0Ff_ee5Jkg,ShortCircuit," - This video was sponsored by 1MORE. And they've got us checking out their Evo earbuds today. They're available in at least white and black. Ooh. And it looks like they have compacted up their case quite a bit. They boast 28 hours of playback time on a single charge, eight hours on the earbuds themselves, the other 20 in the wireless charging case. They've got QI charging. They can also charge via USBC. They have antimicrobial ear tips, which is a pretty useful feature. I mean, I'm not usually that concerned with getting microbial infections from my own ears but, if you were to share, which I would never recommend, I guess that could be a concern. They offer two different types of transparency mode, one that's just a basic transparency mode and another, that actively looks for voices. And they've actually got multiple tiers of active noise cancellation as well. So in terms of feature richness, these are looking pretty darn complete. They boast six microphones for rejecting ambient noise when you're on a call. And that's actually where I'd like to start because that's a big problem that I have with my current daily drivers, the AirPods Pros. Because of the highly subjective nature of audio products, I should lay out, that even though this is a sponsored video, I still can't say anything I don't believe so. So if I were to say, these are, in spite of looking kind of deep and bulky, extremely light and comfortable, then that would be because that's what I actually think. And I do need to kind of, Mark, you're gonna have to try and kinda catch me over here 'cause I need to lie down. Really for me, the main mark of a wireless earphone's comfort, is not necessarily day to day. And these are, I mean, these are just kind of really solid there. There's no way they're coming out of my ears, just even with the stock tips, right out of the box, really liking that. Really lightweight. But, can I lie on them? Okay. Wow, okay. On a hard armrest, maybe a little bit of a pressure point right here but, I looked at these and I thought, wow, these are gonna be really uncomfortable and they are totally not. Included in the box are five different size of ear tips. You can see them laid out here on the table in front of me. As well as a USBC charging cable. And of course, the wireless charging case itself. Let's get a quick size comparison in here. Apple still sets the standard when it comes to super compact charging cases but you can see, that one more has actually made up a ton of ground. And when you factor in that they've actually got greater battery capacity, then at least there's a justification for it. Unlike how it used to be. They will fit comfortably, in what I like to call my earphone pocket. Slide in and out pretty easily. I was worried that this textured finish might be a little bit too textured but, actually it seems not bad. You kinda get under it and there you go. And if we wanna go any further than this, we kinda need to install the app, which, conveniently, I have already done. Let's see how well their magnets guide them into, oh, okay, that's not bad. Not a lot of fuss. That's nice. Every once in a while you'll encounter ones where it's just like kinda finicky to get them in place. So if I'm just, yeah, I wanna be just kinda careless, just chuck 'em in there, yeah, not bad actually. Love how painless it is to pair these days. Oh and they're Bluetooth 5.2, which means that they support multi-device, pretty sic. Really? 10 millimeter dynamic driver, plus a balanced armature driver for punchy bass and smooth mids. I don't know if I have seen a wireless ear phone design that's hybrid, dynamic and balanced armature drivers. Maybe I have and I just forget 'cause I'm doing this for a long time but, okay. Put the headphone in a comfortable position in the ear. Turn the talking mic towards the mouth and leave the earbud uncovered. Oh, so there's your main microphone right there. And I guess this one and this one, are both for ambient sound rejection, which makes sense. You're gonna need an internal mic if you want to have any kind of chance of active noise cancellation, okay. Listening modes, touch and hold for one and a half seconds. I do wish that that auditory feedback for changing modes, would happen once it registers. Oh, wait it does eventually. So are there three different modes I'm cycling through? Okay, I wish it was a little faster. I wish it was one second. Okay. So let's hear transparent mode. This is full pass through. Hi, how you guys doing? - [Male] I'm doing good, yourself? - I will say, compared to the XM5s that we just looked at, oh, sorry, the over the ear, so, WH-1000XM5s, one more is not doing as good a job of naturally passing through my surroundings to me. But, to their credit, my voice in my own head, sounds way more natural. And it's far less off-putting I also don't have voice enhancement on yet. So, can you guys hit me with a voice again? - [Mark] Hi! - Jono, you wanna talk to me at all? - [Jono] I think you're a swell guy. - You got nothing, oh my God, don't suck up. - [Jono] I do think you're a swell guy. - I don't detect much difference between them but both of them are absolutely usable. It's nice to have easy access to just no active noise cancellation, that can help you save some battery if you just want to passively block out noise, they are IEMs and there's no actual, you know, air channel through them or anything like that. So they will naturally block a lot of the surrounding noise. And then, ANC is gonna take that to another level. By default, they're on strong. And I can tell you that quieted down basically all of the ambient noise here, no strong pressure sensation. But, even their strong is not the strongest I've encountered, I can say that much already. (clapping) Now the thing about clapping, is that any ANC is gonna have trouble with that. But you'll still be able to take some of the edge off of it. I will say that it is surprising how far we've come for anything other than an Apple or a Bose product, for active noise cancellation performance. Like we are gonna need to do a serious ANC roundup once we've got our dummy head working and all of that. Guys, check out that LTT video, it's coming very soon. We're gonna be benchmarking, like, $40,000 dummy heads, for testing acoustic equipment. Sound ID. Oh, this is that personalization thing. Choose the sound you like. This is a really cool way of doing this. So it plays around with the EQ a little bit. And then you just, A, B, choose which one you like. And then it kind of dials it down and dials it down. We're at the point now where they are extremely close. Okay. Let's see what my sound signature is. Obviously that could be genre specific but they actually do a pretty good job of providing at least a handful of different genres for you to choose from. It's now personalized. Okay. Well, what does this mean? Are you gonna show me what my like, EQ is? Oh, well, that's lame. Okay, well there's a bit of feedback that I would provide. I'd like to see what kind of EQ I ended up choosing. Sure. How about some Abba? (upbeat music) That is a really cool way for any idiot normy, to go through and dial in a customized EQ. Because the reality of it is, between two similarly priced headphones, a lot of the time you can make up a lot of the difference between them, by EQing too much base out. Or by EQing down some of the sparkle and the highs. And so by just having this simple little set up process, that's really intuitive, these just sound really good. How much do they cost anyway? 170 bucks. Okay, so they're priced right up there with what you would expect for a pair of feature rich, wireless in ears. But honestly, like, I see a ton of value in that particular aspect of the software, more than just about anything else. Like they sound great because I tuned them to make sure they would sound great to me. I ended up making it all the way through the video before remembering to do this test call to check out the mic. So, hey Jono, are you recording the call? - [Jono] Yep, I am recording. - Well, I would ask how I sound but honestly, it's kind of irrelevant 'cause we're gonna let the audience decide for themselves how I sound. You sound great though. - [Jono] Thank you. You sound fantastic. - Thank you. I mean, in fairness, there's not actually a whole lot of like, ambient noise around me right now though. Do we even really have anything that makes a ton of noise at the moment? - [Jono] Mark kinda makes a lot of noise. - Mark, okay, that's not the kinda noise though. It has to be like traffic noise, like that kind of thing. Okay, here's something. I can rattle this chain. - Which way does it go? Okay, so I'm talking to you while I am raising a bay door. I don't know how much this is making a difference or not. Okay, cool. So that's kind of what it's supposed to sound like. And then whatever Jono has on the other side, is what it's managing to subtract from it. No, they're not IE 600s, which we checked out recently. Guys, you can check that video out if you're looking for something else to watch. But they also aren't intended to be, they don't have a wire. It would also be really nice if it spat out the EQ. And then, you know how it says, hey, you should listen to some music and, you know, try it out, so it should spit out your EQ, then allow you to play some music and fine tune things. So that you can find something that works across the different genres that you like. I definitely didn't leave enough in the highs for music like this, for example. Still tons of potential. Just like you have the potential to subscribe. Thanks 1MORE for sponsoring this video. And thanks to you for watching.

just always get my juices flowing let's go i've searched they didn't pay for for a love that i thought i couldn't find i and they out for a love that's mine oh mine i absolutely found that phone [Music] and he knows that i'm playing the fool let's go the ginger came into my life and you changed that now i know what i wanna where is that um i hope this is my part right here since i found you [Music] let's go let me calm down let me calm down all right let's try the uh smart playing balls all right okay whoo bro again and i was kind of hyped right there these are the truth this is another one of these earbuds that i would easily easily state my youtube reputation and tell you that if you buy these you are not going to be disappointed okay the sound quality on these earbuds are ridiculous now i'm going to put them back in real quick because there's one thing that i want to test all right i got the music started playing by itself we got to take it over to nipsy hustle blue laces 2. okay here we go oh baby i'm trying to hold it in now i'm holding my excitement okay let's go [Laughter] this song does it whoa bro bro monkey let me know that all right i take these out again now look i'm gonna be honest with y'all when i test earbuds i know i tend to get hyped because i love music this is one of my passions in life is music and when i hear music that's played the right way when the quality of the music it tends to touch my soul i am not exaggerating what i'm telling y'all right now these earbuds are the truth now when i originally seen the price i had 169 bucks when you think when you think about one more you tend to think of budget earbuds someone's like i don't know can they really compete with the other big boy brands at that price range these deliver okay again i would state my youtube reputation on this if you buy these earbuds you're going to love the sound quality on these these are one more best earbuds to date easily all right let's keep it moving and do a little bit more testing all right so let's do the reconnection test how long did it take to reconnect to your phone after you take them out and put them in the charging case let's get them pop these out okay we'll drop them in the case wait for them to fully disconnect okay here we go take them out one mississippi wow before i was about to say two mississippi it already connected instant connection all right so now let's try the dual device connection feature now i turned off smart playback so you can hear it for yourself i'm gonna hit play in the music okay this is from the android phone let's hit pause now play music from the iphone and there it is all right so you can rock two devices at the same time now let's do the one earbud test can you play music from one earbud while the other one is charging up in the case let's hit play in the music okay now i'm gonna take out the left earbud let's drop it in the case close it up let's hit play on the music okay the music is playing out of the right side let's put the left side back in okay reconnect it instantly take the right side out drop it in the case let's see playing the music okay the music is playing so this is pretty dope you can play music from either earbud while the other one is charging up in the case basically doubling the battery life alright so now let's check the touch controls and on the side note these are fully customizable but here's how i got my setup so triple tap on the right earbud for playing pause okay the music is playing double tap on the right earbud to skip to the next song and double tap on the left ear bud to go to the previous track just like that now again if you want to customize it go to the app and go into settings and you can switch these up all right so now let's check the call quality i'm gonna call amaya up one more evo dual devices connected at the same time let's get max volume hi girlie what's up why you whispering what you doing over there okay okay okay all right what's up um you trying to work all right good you're good check this out all right i got some new earbuds i need you to tell me how i sound sound good which one do you think sound

so now let's check for latency and what i mean by that is when you're watching a video is there any delay from the person's lips to what you hear okay now i got netflix skewed up i was watching a little war of the worlds no lip sync delay at all so this will be perfect for watching your videos all right so now let's talk about transparency mode and active noise cancellation now as far as transparency mode no issues at all i got it turned on right now i can hear my voice crystal clear i can hear my snaps i can hear my nails on the table and i can't white shoes sounded like a v12 now as

96,Owp8gv-ooJU,1MORE EVO True Wireless Review (3 Months Of Use),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owp8gv-ooJU,Picky Audio, hey everyone today we're going to be checking out the one more Evo noise canceling earbuds they come in at 170 us 230 Australian and at this price are trying to compete with the likes of Apple Sennheiser Sony Sound core all the top noise canceling earbuds so today I'll be comparing the EVO to all those earbuds because in some ways they're really good other ways not so much so let's start with how the earbuds look it's a pretty simple look as you can see nice slick bronze Accent on the outside there glossy finish smooth matte plastic on the inside overall look it's nothing special but it gets the job done what's more important and then the looks is the fit and that's where these really do shine so as you can see in the ear canal not too bad at all it's pretty small earbud the comfort is okay it's not on the level of a pair like the one more Comfort bars or the airpods pro but I can wear these for about three hours before I get any discomfort and when it comes to how secure the fit is in my weight training session I had no issues at all with the buds falling out just a couple of readjustments were required and when like clenching my jaw through those hard sets doing some bench press making some weird training faces the buds kind of move around slightly but it's not too bad one little downside is that I couldn't find if these had an ipx rating I looked all over their website on the box I couldn't find anything so I'm assuming there is no water resistant rating if it turns out there is I'll Chuck a comment down below now let's talk about battery life the advertised amounts you're getting is five and a half hours with the earbuds 20 hours in total with noise canceling on or you're gonna get eight hours from the earbuds 28 hours in total with noise canceling off and in my test at 70 volume I haven't run the test yet I'm going to Chuck up the numbers somewhere up here to see what I got at 70 volume tested on an iPhone 10s with noise canceling on so taking all those numbers into account for the size of the case it's not too bad it could be slightly more compact compared to the airports Pro case here for reference is noticeably thinner so still overall pretty compact considering the amount of battery life you are getting you're also getting some fast charge actions so Chuck the earbuds in the case for 15 minutes you can get four hours of playback which is some of the highest that I've seen in a while and these are also compatible with your favorite wireless charger now the build quality of the case is really solid just a smooth matte finish all around you can see there's this case has been scratched up quite a bit that's because I've left it in my gym bag for about two months since I've got these maybe three months I'm not too sure so look it's gonna get scratched up but that's the point of a case I've left it in a bag with keys and a whole bunch of other earbuds so the actual build here is great and you've also got an LED indicator to let you know when you need to charge your case up now let's talk about controls sadly as usual for one more you don't get a single tap on either earbuds so this does mean you're pretty limited here's all the controls you get right out of the box but keep in mind you can customize these in the app but still with that lack of the single tap on either earbud you're pretty limited so you can add volume control if you you like but you have to sacrifice skipping tracks playing pools any detection is here so when you've got both earbuds in you take one out your music will pause and what I like seeing here say you've got noise canceling on you've got both earbuds in take one out the earbud that's still in your ear noise canceling will turn off so you don't have noise canceling on in one ear which sounds very weird in a noisy environment and of course Chuck your earbud back in to resume the music and you can also turn this on or off in the app now let's talk about connectivity you got the old high-res audio badge there which means of course you're getting your lzac codec so if you're an Android User using your high quality streaming service like apple music or tidal anything like that you're going to get about a 10 Improvement in your overall sound quality that's what I normally notice comparing ldac to either AAC or aptx but the most exciting feature here is the very rare multi-point connection so that means you can connect these earbuds to two devices at the same time and in my testing having them connected to my iPhone as well as my MacBook Pro it's very seamless it's going to pause your media on one device and play it on the next and all seamlessly switch I had no issues at all with it and it's great to see more earbuds with multi-point connection it's a rare feature nicely done one more and as you normally see with pretty much any true RC but nowadays you can leave one earbud in the case while the other is still in your ear and that works with either earbud a little issue though is that it doesn't work in mono mode so basically if you're using just one earbud you don't get your left and your right audio channels if you're using the left earbud you're only going to get the left audio channel so that's what I mean by it not working in mono mode very weird to see but most earbuds even the cheapest earbuds out there work in mono mode so don't know why it's not here but it's not here now in terms of latency there is no low latency gaming mode here but I'm just going to Chuck up my latency results in my gaming test on both IOS and Android basically if you can get around 200 milliseconds that's as low as it gets put some nice low latency if you're into Shooters and stuff like that as long as you're below 400 milliseconds or even around that it's more casual games you'll be fine but now I'll leave you with the indoor and outdoor microphone samples alright so here is a microphone test with the one more Evo and I'm just in a nice quiet room here at the moment all right so here I am in the outside world on a nice busy Motorway record my iPhone so you can hear how noisy it is out here right now and now this is what the microphone sounds like on the one little Evo so hopefully all the cars and all the noise here is getting locked up quite well all right now let's talk about the noise canceling performance as you can see you're getting an advertised 42 decibel reduction which unlimiters don't look at I just run them through my noise canceling test and how I test all my noise canceling earbuds is on my soundbar I play simulation crowd noise train noise plane noise so I can get nice high frequency and low frequency sounds and the one more Evo are coming in in that number three spot which was previously held by the Sennheiser momentum 3 so some really solid noise canceling performance nicely done one more you're also getting some customization in the app so you have a lot of different settings there with your noise canceling strength you have a wind noise reduction mode as well as an Adaptive noise canceling mode which is kind of there to adjust the noise canceling strength depending on the outside environment so this can save some battery life I was also hoping that that adaptive noise canceling would automatically turn the wind noise reduction on but sadly it doesn't now when it comes to EQ shift that's how your sound quality changes with noise canceling on compared to noise canceling off it's very minimal here the treble increases by about five percent becomes a bit harsher loses a tiny bit of detail but five percent difference is not massive at all and the bass and everything else basically stays the same now with the transparency mode it's not too bad I'm going to rate it at 7.5 out of 10 compared to a pair like the airpods pro they still have the best transparency mode a solid 10 out of 10 and the biggest difference when comparing the airpods pro to the one more Evo is when you have the airpods pro transparency mode on you don't really know it's actually on where with the one more Evo you get a bit of that static White Noise hissing sound in the background so you can kind of tell the transparency mode is on but overall 7.5 out of 10 not too bad and you also have two transparency options in the app General awareness and voice but I honestly didn't notice a huge difference between the two now let's talk about what's obviously most important sound quality and overall I'm a little disappointed with the sound here one more is definitely known for their more natural tuning and one more Advertiser sound with Crystal Clear highs accurate mids and warm bass and that's kind of what you get getting but doesn't really work at least for my ears so the high end here definitely has some nice Sparkle it's a sparkly treble response which is well separated from the other frequencies it sounds really nice but at the cost of getting harsh quite often even when you're not venturing at too high of a volume even around 60 some songs can get a little bit over the top with the treble now the biggest disappointment here for me is the base they've advertised it as balanced and it kind of is but it still sounds pretty flat to my liking I find this kind of bass response only really works with instrumentation and that kind of stuff if you're into hip-hop EDM hard dance music even if you EQ these in the app you can't really push out enough bass and even with genres like SCI trans I noticed the bass got a little bit wonky at times with certain songs but I am a bit of a bass head and I will compare this to other buds in a sec but if you just want to listen to instrumentation this is going to be good for you still now even with this lackluster base the mid-range is really nothing special I was expecting a little more Clarity and detail with the mids they are accurate I guess a little bit recessed so it's kind of a more a more smooth mid-range so overall the sound here it's the treble is kind of the star of the show it is nice trouble but that's about it couple Pros though is the Sound Stage and instrument separation is very solid which is kind of expected with this kind of tuning now luckily there is some EQ customization and this is what I use to kind of boost the mids and bring the trouble down ever so slightly and I find this makes them sound a little bit better if you wanted to make these a more bass heavy sounding earbud you can pump that bass all the way up it's just not going to sound that good so I found not really bothering by increasing the bass it just gets a little bit over the top and I'd say the most lacking part is with sub bass you don't really get too deep of a bash response so basically I'd rate it like it's 5 out of 10 on my sub scale which is probably the lowest I've ever rated now I will pop up my generating checklist so you can see all the different genre ratings there kind of as I explain the sound you're getting higher scores with more instrument focused music uh anything EDM it's again not terrible I'm being a bit hard here but like I said I feel like I'm being a bit harsh but that's kind of because I obviously compared these to a lot of earbuds that have a similar kind of balanced more natural tuning airpods Pro definitely known for their balanced natural tuning which a lot of people like very mid focused I have to say that airpods Pro easily sound better than the one more Evo here you're also getting slightly more of that deep sub bass on the airpods pro these aren't a bud that are known for a heavy bash response but it's got a better experience with more genres on the airpods pro and the treble also doesn't get harsh ever very nice travel on the airpods pro another earbud with a balanced training the Galaxy buds Pro quite a mid Focus tuning but again just comparing the sound here you've got a fuller bass response on the buds Pro a more forward mid-range treble also an issue here slightly harsh at higher volumes in some songs but overall better listening experience on the buds Pro now compared to a cheaper pair the edifier Neo buds Pro slightly cheaper than the one more Evo here when it comes to Pure Clarity and detail instrument separation all that good stuff the one more Evo do get the win but the Neo buds come very close and they are pushing out a lot more bass more bass compared to the airpods pro and the buds Pro so if you do like a bit of extra bass and don't mind losing a bit of detail the price these are up these are going to be the better option now compared to the sound core Liberty 3 Pro think of these like the Neo buds a bass heavy tuning but a little bit of extra detail in the instrument separation and Clarity department so kind of a better sounding Neo buds Pro so that kind of explains that now we're kind of going into more expensive earbuds but the Sony WF xm4s these can just EQ a lot better than the one more Evo so you can actually get the Sony's sounding very close to that natural kind of tuning the one more Evo have then you have more flexibility to make these quite a bass heavy tuning overall just sound better and that's also going to be a similar situation with the Sennheiser momentum 3. quite a bass heavy tuning out of the box when it comes to the Natural tuning and instrument separation the one more Evo do get the win but again just to Fuller sound you get more customization on the EQ with the sunnis and these are still one of my favorite buds with a bass heavy tuning retaining as much clarity as possible so to wrap it up here the only two major issues at least for me is the sound and the lackluster touch control customization apart from that noise cancel performance is great fit is great everything else is spot on I just wish the tuning was a little bit better but again you might like it but I'm being honest here I don't really like it but I'm not going to forget the lzac support as well as multi-point connection so overall solid stuff as long as you like your natural tuning but if you're like me you like a bit more of a fuller sound I will leave my Sennheiser momentum 3 review up here so check that out in the meantime stay picky I'll see you in the next video bye now,1MORE Evo,The Evo noise canceling earbuds come in at 170 us 230 Australian.The build quality of the case is really solid just a smooth matte finish all around.The most exciting feature here is the very rare multi-point connection. I had no issues at all with it and it's great to see more earbuds with multi-point connection it's a rare feature nicely done one more.It doesn't work in mono mode so basically if you're using just one earbud you don't get your left and your right audio channels if you're using the left earbud you're only going to get the left audio channel.Overall I'm a little disappointed with the sound here one more is definitely known for their more natural tuning and one more Advertiser sound with Crystal Clear highs accurate mids and warm bass I am a bit of a bass head and I will compare this to other buds in a sec but if you just want to listen to instrumentation this is going to be good for you. bass got a little bit wonky at times with certain songs but I am a bit of a bass head and I will compare this to other buds in a sec but if you just want to listen to instrumentation this is going to be good for you.

more brand new evo true wireless earbuds and what these are technically is one more's attempt at going straight at the big boys when it comes to earbuds i mean they're going for sony they're going for sennheiser they're going for bowers and wilkins in fact they sent a spreadsheet that's comparing these specs from this earbud to all of those different models so we're going to talk about all of those different specs we're going to check out all the stuff that comes inside the box we're going to talk about the price and a bunch of different things and see how well it competes against a lot of those so to start with let's go ahead and talk about the price now these do come in at 169 bucks but they are offering an early bird special again these come out on may 10th and they're also throwing in a 30 qi wireless charging pad so they're taking 30 off the price so you can pick them up for 139 bucks you get a wireless charging pad with that as well and when you start to already compare price wise to the sony's which are 280 the sennheisers which are 300 and the bowers and wilkins which i don't really know but i'm gonna assume is over three hundred dollars there's already a significant gap now if you are looking at buying these they do come in two different colors i have the black version here but it's also available in white and both models are trimmed in gold so what makes this pair stand out well these are using hybrid drivers so it has a 10 millimeter dynamic driver that they are pairing up with a balanced armature driver so they're letting the dynamic driver handle all of your low end while having the balanced armature driver handle more of your mids and your treble so it's trying to keep everything separated but allowing you to get the most out of each one now as far as some of the technology these do have bluetooth 5.2 this pair is high-res audio certified because it is ldac compatible now this is something that the sony's have ldac is a higher-end bluetooth codec so if you have a device that is ldac compatible you definitely will be able to get the most out of these now this does work with one more's app and i do feel like one more app is kind of limited there's a lot of things that it doesn't let you do but one more does work with sound id which is basically a feature where it takes you through a listening test where you tell it that you prefer sound a over b or vice versa and it tries to give you an eq setting based off sounds that you like and there is a night and day difference between this sound and the sound that they have out of the box so really everybody's sound is going to be a little bit different now i do wish that the app just let you eq some things on your own but they're kind of pushing this sound id feature so i think that's kind of why they strip away some of the eq settings now also within the app you can go in and switch around some controls but there's very very limited capabilities of doing this and we'll talk about that a little bit later and you also have the ability to update your earbuds and then also turn these smart sensors on and off or change what the smart sensors do so if you want it to pause when you take it out but not resume when you put them back in you can do that or you can have it resume when you put them back in or you can just shut them off altogether so it does give you some controls and it does give you these soothing sounds if you want to use the earbuds to kind of relax or meditate or fall asleep but this is other features we've seen in other one more earbuds but the huge thing here is the ability to switch between noise cancelling on the off mode and then your transparency mode but in noise canceling you have different levels you can switch between you have an adapt mode where it'll just kind of adapt to whatever your surroundings are you have a wind noise mode so if you just want to block out some wind if you have a fan kind of blowing at you or if you're riding a bike and then it has a mild and strong and i can tell you that the strong mode gets eerily quiet i mean this is definitely where this compares to the sony and the bose that has some of the best noise canceling out there and i honestly think that the strong mode kind of even gives you that like vacuum suction type feel i mean it really does isolate you from a lot of the sounds around you now also with its active noise canceling it is using one more's quiet max technology and what this is is it's allowing the noise canceling to be used without having to overtake your audio if you're used to using noise canceling products usually when you switch the noise canceling on it starts to make your audio sound kind of bloated and although it does boost the bass just slightly on this pair for the most part there's not a huge audio difference between the noise canceling on and the noise canceling off so that is another huge plus now for you guys that do like to use more than one device at a time one more evos do have the dual device connection which basically means that you can connect to your phone while also using your tablet or your laptop uh that way you can watch a movie but if somebody calls in on your phone it's easy to just switch over and take that call without having to go into settings and shut things off and then switch things over so again this is another thing that i know a lot of you guys are interested in now as far as using this pair outdoors it does come in rated at ipx4 which means it's pretty much fine against splashes and sweat and rain and things like that but this is not one of those pairs that you can dip or drop into water now as far as what all they've included inside the box they do give you five sets of silicone ear tips and it is important that you get the right fit especially with this pair being noise cancelling and they've also included a usbc cable but a huge plus like i said earlier this pair is qi wireless charging compatible so you can just come in drop this pair on any wireless charger and it will start charging and speaking of the charging the battery life on these is not the best compared to a lot of these other ones that we mentioned earlier if you do decide to use these with the noise canceling off you can actually get about eight hours on the earbuds with around 28 hours using the case but if you do decide to use these with the noise canceling on that brings the battery life all the way down to five and a half hours on the earbuds and about 20 hours using the case now although i think that this battery life is going to be fine for most people if you compare them to the sony's i think the sony's definitely get maybe almost double what these give you so that is something you might want to keep in mind but the fast charge feature that's on this pair is very impressive if you just happen to pick your earbuds up and they are dead a 15 minute charge will give you four hours of use and again i think that is very impressive i love when earbuds give you a long battery life that you can get just by plugging your device in for about 10-15 minutes so that is definitely a huge plus for this pair now moving over to looking at the case and the earbuds themselves the case definitely has a premium feel to it i would say it almost has like a metal or aluminum type feel but it does have some good weight to it on the back you can see the usbc input for charging and then around on the front you have that single indicator light and this is what allows you just to kind of gauge how much battery life is left on the case but when you open up the lid you can see that the earbuds kind of have a glossy look right there where your touch controls are located and the frustrating thing about the touch controls on here is they only allow you to kind of switch around a couple of things you only get two different controls that you can switch between and that's the double tap and triple tap this pair does have a smart sensor so basically what i did was i let it where it will pause and play when i take the earbuds out and put them back in i change my double tap to track control and i change my triple tap to volume control that way i felt like i had control over everything but i still would have liked to have had play and paul's just on the earbuds themselves now for you guys that like to use your earbuds for phone calls one more has six microphones total there's three on each pair and these are very impressive mics i feel like no matter what environment you're in it does a really good job of focusing on your voice and blocking out a lot of your surroundings but you guys can be a judge by listening to a test here so here is the mic test using the one more evos and again this is another area that i was very impressed with i feel like it picks up my voice very clear it does have a slight digital sound but it's a lot less noticeable than it is in other earbuds so this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call and so now here's the mic test with the crowd noise being played which you can hear here and so this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call in public so now let's talk about the sound because the sound out of the box i felt like was rough i mean it sounded very dull it sounded lifeless and i've noticed that one more has basically done this with all of their earbuds that work with the sound id feature because once you go through the sound id test and it basically tries to give you an eq setting based off what it thinks you like there is a huge improvement over the sound out of the box to what it's giving you and i think that maybe again to just sell you on what sound id is doing because once i did that it basically just pushed up everything i mean this was a very boomy pair the bass had tons of impact but it also still stayed very fast which is important to me because i do listen to genres like metal the mids definitely brought the vocalist right up front so if i was listening to something chaotic i didn't feel like the vocalist just got lost with everything else and the treble definitely had a very bright sound to it now i wouldn't say that it gets harsh i would say that with some s's you can kind of get that sibling sound and to me it just gives it a really nice bright detailed sound where i still can get that very thick punchy bass so it just brings out the most in pretty much everything that you're listening to but another thing that i thought was impressive with also getting this very dynamic sound this is a very airy and spacious earbud i mean it just gives you tons of room with the noise cancelling on it does close it in quite a bit it makes you feel a lot more isolated from everything else but with the noise cancelling off you really do have this very open feel and the ability to be able to tell where instruments and sounds and all these different things are coming from this pair does a really good job with so really my overall opinion is this and again this is not a review i feel like it does lack because you can't change the eq settings yourself like you can with the sony's and some other earbuds i really wish that they just gave you all of the controls on the earbuds so you didn't have to switch things around but the fact that it does work with an app means that maybe they can fix this in an update and it also means that maybe later they can add eq options as well but as it is out of the box the app really just doesn't give you a whole lot that you can do but honestly there's not really a lot you're going to want to do i do know that you're going to want to go in and switch around the noise canceling settings because you're not going to want strong noise cancelling all the time or you may just want to block out wind or maybe you just want it to block out a little bit and i do like the fact that you can switch between these different settings if you're looking for a premium pair of noise cancelling earbuds but you don't want to pay you know 280 almost 300 dollars this is one of those pairs you might want to give a look so guys that wraps up my video on the one more evos thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay tuned for more,1MORE Evo,The evo true wireless earbuds come in in two different colors.They have a 10 millimeter dynamic driver that they are using hybrid drivers.There is a night and day difference between this sound and the sound that they have out of the box.

98,PSIqwi0io-I,1MORE EVO Review - The Best ANC Earbuds Of 2022?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSIqwi0io-I,TechTablets, now i do review quite a few TWS ear buds and many  that have anc but every now and then there is a   pair that really does stand out and it's these for  me right now are the one more evos definitely a   standout peritoneus earbuds for their features  sound quality and overall build and what is on   offer here so this model has anc various different  levels up to 42 decibels of noise cancellation   we have six microphones and those microphones are  used for noise cancellation for calls too as well   it does have a runtime on a single charge of up to  five and a half hours with anc on with anc off up   to eight hours and then with the case you do get  an additional two and a half charges with anc on   or off okay they're still going to get those  two and a half charges now the sound quality   is where it does really stand out for me it's  tuned by a grammy award-winning sound engineer   and we do have with this a 10 millimeter driver  handling the lows in the mids and a balanced   armature which of course is going to be handling  the highs and the tune of it is super balanced and   one of the best that my ears have heard in quite  some time included with the evos you'll find a   type a to type c cable so charge time for the  cases two hours for the earbuds is one hour   and we do have some additional silicon tips there  so it's important you find a size that is going to   fit your ears the best there so you get the best  possible seal for the active noise cancellation   and also the sound quality i just wanted to  point this out too inside the box i think it's   quite cool that they have included this so this  is from the full-time grammy award-winning sound   engineer luca and you can see they put some little  sketches in here of them which is a nice added   touch evos do come in two colors there's white  or black and i think this white one looks very   nice so we have a status led right here the lid is  closed magnetically it stays shut and the earbuds   inside if you move it there's no rattling like  some other cases which i do find annoying on   the back we have a type c port when you open it up  they pair up pretty much straight away we've got a   button here to reset it now because it's running  bluetooth 5.2 tech you can actually pair these   up with two different devices there's a status  led on each one of the earbuds you can see as   it's peering up there and the overall quality of  this case is excellent and the evos do support qi   wireless charging standards so you simply place  it on a wireless charging mat and you'll see the   status led comes on and it does start to charge it  will take a little bit longer than cable charging   but it is more convenient these earbuds do have  a very good design and they're packing on a lot   of features so we do have a sensor here that it  has an auto play and stop so if you remove them   it'll stop the music once you put them back  in it'll go again which is handy to have in   a microphone here there's an outer microphone at  the top here this is the capacitive touch surface   this is where you would tap to for example go to  the next track and you can control the volume too   via these but you need to customize that to set  it up through the app so there are customizable   touch controls which is good and then you'll see  that we've got a little microphone there too so   there's three microphones on each of them in total  this one down here is dedicated more to the voice   calls when you're placing voice calls it also  applies noise cancellation and then that active   noise cancelling is using all six of them in total  so excellent finish there are no sharp edges with   the join of the plastic right here the silicon  tips haven't loosened up on me now or got a little   bit softer or anything like that in my week of  testing them and we do have a metal filter right   inside there and those there are the pogo port  contacts for charging them when it's in the case   the evos do support the ldac codec now  that kodak streams at a very high bit rate   really improves the quality so if your phone  supports it you definitely want to be using the   audit codec otherwise it has aac sbc which is more  of a fullback coded if if you're on android but do   try and use aac at least for these of course to  get the good sound quality that these do deliver   so what about our playback time so the earbuds  themselves with anc on i get just over five   hours with anc off you're able to get up to  eight hours the case will give us an additional   20 hours of active noise cancellation playback  time or if you're not using the anc it will give   us an additional 28 hours now the evos to my ears  these sound absolutely fantastic they've gone for   a very balanced tune i don't find the bass to be  overpowering i don't find it to mess around with   the mids at all we've got a 10 millimeter driver  in these then with a balanced armature so the   balanced armature is handling all of the highs and  as a result the highs sound super detailed they're   crisp rock music especially sounds great vocals  are very good and if you want it the 10 millimeter   driver does deliver some great mids and very deep  bass you can tweak that of course with equalizers   i use here power amp but i'm just listening to  it at the moment all sorts of genres of music but   with a default equalizer so it's completely flat  with this i haven't changed it at all and that's   why i say that these do have i think an excellent  tune balanced and just super high quality sound   that's coming out of these the evos have to be  this year's best i i think that i've listened to   especially when it comes to the sound stage and  just the general tune out of the box speaking of   tune it can be tweaked even further through the  one more application so when you first boot this   up there is a questionnaire to personalize  the sound to your tastes which is great   and it is a global equalizer so it doesn't  matter if whatever music app you're using   you've got an equalizer there you don't need to  use that so it can be for netflix and everything   else connected of course to these earbuds so you  do have here a option for the smart playback to   disable that that's using that sensor so when it  detects it's in your ears the music will continue   when you pull them out the music will stop custom  settings i've made a bit of a change here myself   to this so triple tap now i have the volume up  and down which is great and you can see we do   have these other options so i like that level of  customization that you don't normally get with   other brands other brands won't even have an app  they push through firmware updates so there's one   that's already comes through so even before these  are officially released they had a pre-release   firmware they've improved upon the sound quality  the signature of them and tweak things like the   microphones which is really good to see that  they're on to this and they can fix anything   and tweak it once they get that feedback coming  through push out firmware updates there are some   guides there and soothing sounds which is basic  ambient noises like rain or storms or things like   that to help you sleep and relax which is another  little bonus that it does have this app and you   can sit there the listening modes with the anc  transparency mode or just have it off completely   microphone quality now with the evos so they do  have some active noise cancellation and i've got a   fan from a pc a desktop pc that's it going in the  background we shouldn't be able to hear that and i   do find that the microphone quality that we're  getting with the one more evos is excellent so   voice calls that are placed with this i have not  had any problems and this is on the latest new   firmware and latency this used to be a problem  but it's really a thing of the past now with   modern bluetooth 5.2 and the newer tech coming  through so the evo's watching an episode here   of vikings valhalla it's all in sync with their  mouths perfectly i can't see any problems now this   is with a snapdragon 8 gen 1 powered phone mind  you if i use my iphone there's a little bit of   a delay now gaming is the only area where i see  and a tiny little split second of latency there   it's not super annoying but some people may detect  it but here with streaming like amazon prime video   netflix no problems at all with the latency so  as soon as you open the case they pair up and   they're very easy to fit so put them in give  them a little bit of a twist you get the beep   beep confrontation that it has connected up and  you can see they don't stick out my ears too much   uh fatigue-wise i get a little bit after about  four hours of listening to music with these which   is pretty standard there that's like with any  other inner ears a little bit of pressure there   from the silicon tips but i do have a very good  seal and i don't feel like they're going to fall   out on me so when i'm walking around i go up down  the stairs here uh standard kind of things i don't   feel like i have to keep doing that which i can't  say about other tdrs earbuds some of them always   feel like they're going to drop out and i have to  keep doing that not these ones once i put them in   the fit seems to be very good for me  now i haven't gone for a run testing   them out because these aren't really sports  earbuds i wouldn't be doing sports with them   but they do have an ipx rating so it's just sweat  and splashes and things like that is not going to   be a problem for them so you can do that if you  want but i just think this kind of fit without   the air hooks might have that potential to drop  out or feel like it's going to drop out on you   so anc yes it's there it is powerful compared to  other models that i have reviewed and i've covered   so they claim 42 decibels is the noise reduction  ambient noise reduction there now i've got   no way to measure that at all however compared to  the other models you can certainly tell that it is   quite powerful for inner ears that is you can hear  that light white noise the hissing noise that's   going on in the background when it is activated  and cycling through the different modes so it's   got a pass-through mode it tends to work quite  well now it just makes a beat noise as you go   through them but i really wish that one more if  they could add a voice confirmation to tell us   like it could say anc strong mode anc mild anc  wind noise uh pass through mode that would be a   little bit more handy even though what you put it  on the password mode you know straight away when   you're on it because you can suddenly hear things  a lot better i've noticed that if you especially   are outside when you have the pass-through mode  on you want to hear traffic or announcements for   example in a train station bus station whatever  you do hear a bit of wind noise come through with   those mics that's one thing i picked up on that  the wind noise is amplified you get a lot of it   but you don't get it if you use the active noise  cancelling modes for listening to the music it's   only when you have it in that pass-through mode  so disconnections have i had any problems i'm   in a busy noisy 2.4 gigahertz environment which  these do run on so bluetooth frequency there and   other bluetooth apps and tech around so i've got  keyboard mice phones all that sort of stuff no   problems with the connections the range on these  seems pretty standard so it's about 10 meters five   more than that about eight meters or so that  they start to break out one of these but i can go   and leave my phone here go downstairs and even  a bit outside and it's still working and then   one of the ears might disconnect and i realized  that oh i haven't actually got my phone on me so   that is good and then let's talk about the tune of  these this is one of the key things why would go   for the one more evos fantastic tune just so  balanced you get detailed crisp highs that   you don't get with other brands you've got the  vocals that really do stand out they're clear   soundstage is great the bass um it's not  overpowering which is something that i can't tell   about a lot of other tunes of terrorist tech that  i get that they're just too much bass the lows are   just boosted up way too high but not here they are  balanced a very good tune to my ears and of course   using an equalizer if your personal preference  is more base more lows then you can just boost   that up and and that's that's good but for me the  training out of the box is is something i really   don't want to mess with it's good i think it is  good especially for rock lovers out there rock   music those highs so detailed from the balanced  armature but we still get powerful bass when you   want it if you're listening to other genres  so all up these are quality very high quality   heroes earbuds we've got wireless charging from  the case l deck support now i wanted to mention   ldac that i couldn't test it out with my phones  here i couldn't get it to actually show that it   was running on the ldac codec i was running on aac  so i'm not too sure what's up with that because   other brands or even from one more i'm pretty  sure i could run ldac with some of their other   ones the dual driver pro that i tested out a long  time ago so i'm not too sure what's up with that   it could just be a firmware thing they do have  firmware updates with the application of course   application you can tweak the sound you can change  a few other settings he's also got that auto   pause feature so much on offer good sound quality  battery run time is on a single charge with a anc   on average so it's only about five hours is all  i'm able to get out of them but if you don't use   the anc all the time it's up to eight hours which  is definitely fine and acceptable even five five   is not too bad and you do get extra two and a half  charges out of these so they are a solid offering   from them they get a big thumbs up from me for  all of those things i mentioned the features the   sound quality the tune definitely there and  i do have to see in the next one bye for now,1MORE Evo,The peritoneus evos are a standout peritoneus earbuds for their features sound quality and overall build.This model has anc various different levels up to 42 decibels of noise cancellation.It has a runtime on a single charge of up to five and a half hours with anc on with anc

99,6Z6vXtcsjEY,1More EVO True Wireless Review | The Bose &amp; Sony Killer??,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z6vXtcsjEY,CEONTHEMAKING, all right so the time is officially here uh we are checking out the one more evo true wireless earbuds and these are the latest flagship earbuds from one more and they're bringing a ton of value for the price uh they're coming in at 169 bucks but from now until june 8th you can actually take advantage of their early bird pricing which is going to save you an additional 30 dollars so you can pick these up for only 140 which is an excellent price if you ask me so after you watch this video make sure you check out the link down in the description so that you can take advantage of that deal so we're going to get into the video but let me just tell you this right off the bat these are competing uh with pretty much anything out there the bose the sony uh probably the sennheisers even though i don't have those yet i'm supposed to be getting those in a few days so i'll make sure to do some comparisons but i'm gonna go out on a limb and say that they're competing with those as well so enough of that let's just go ahead and jump right into it starting off with the case so one thing i love about the case is the finish and just the feel of it i mean almost has like a brushed metal type of feel i'm not sure if it is or not it might just be plastic but um it definitely feels premium in the hands obviously you have your one more branding on the top you also have a single led indicator in the middle on the back is where you have your type c charging port and the case does support wireless charging which is always nice to have on the inside you do have a pairing button there in the middle and overall the build quality of the case is definitely solid moving over to the earbuds you do have black as well as white as color options obviously we have the black version here so you have the one more branding there in the center on the touch surface and then it's surrounded by kind of a rose gold accent which definitely gives it a premium look in my opinion as far as the touch controls uh typical one more fashion you have a double tap a triple tap as well as a long press the long press is dedicated to control the active noise cancellation as well as the transparency mode and then the double tap and triple tap can be customized within the one more app and then you also do have in-ear detection with these so these are running bluetooth 5.2 as far as audio codecs you have sbc aac as well as ldac so if you have a compatible device you can tap into that high resolution codec these also support independent use so you can use either the left or the right earbud while the other remains inside of the case as far as battery life with active noise cancellation turned off you're looking at roughly eight hours on a single charge with a total of 28 hours including the case with active noise cancellation turned on you're looking closer to five and a half hours on a single charge with a total of 20 hours including the case and then these also have an ipx4 water resistant rating so they're safe for sweat and light splashes of water but definitely not a pair that you want to completely submerge so when it comes to the fit these actually surprise me because usually when it comes to flagship earbuds they're very large because they're trying to pack a lot of technology in there but these are actually pretty reasonable in terms of size so i'm able to get a pretty decent fit uh so for me casual use is perfectly fine uh if you have medium to larger size ears i definitely think you can get away with using these for more intense movements like hitting the gym as far as comfort these are also very comfortable if you didn't notice these are using those oval shaped ear tips which helps tremendously in terms of the comfort so wearing these for extended periods of time should be no problem so before we jump into the sound quality let's talk a little bit about the active noise cancellation as well as the transparency mode so when it comes to noise cancellation you do have a few different modes um so you have strong you have mild uh you have wind noise reduction and you have adaptive so strong and mild those are pretty self-explanatory the wind noise reduction that's going to be helpful for the times that you're outdoors and it's very windy and you get that annoying sound of the wind blowing past the microphones of the earbuds you can activate that setting and it's almost going to eliminate that sound completely so it's definitely helpful and then as far as the adaptive uh that's basically where the earbuds will detect how much noise is taking place around you and then adjust the active noise cancellation accordingly so overall the active noise cancellation is definitely giving you some flagship performance now the question that everybody wants to know is it enough to dethrone bose or sony and i would say not quite but don't get me wrong we're talking like one one a type performance so it's extremely close to the bose and the sony which is saying quite a bit so if you were to purchase these and test out the active noise cancellation there's not enough difference there that you would regret purchasing these compared to something like the bose or the sony and then once you factor in the price difference you're definitely going to be satisfied with your purchase and it's pretty much the exact same thing with the ambient mode flagship level performance you do have two different modes for that as well so you have the pass-through mode as well as the voice enhancement mode and comparing these again to like the bose and the sony there's not really much difference there that you can really detect so now let's go ahead and talk about the sound quality which is where things start to get interesting so make sure you stay tuned for my full-on comparison videos because i will go a little bit deeper as far as how these stack up against the competition but i will say that the dual driver setup sounds incredible um you're getting some very nice separation between the bass and the treble you're getting a very powerful sound and overall some very good extension and just overall range they also take the eq adjustments very well so within the one more app you do have access to the sound id feature which is basically like a hearing test that you can go through and based on that the app will come up with a custom eq profile just for you so i definitely recommend going through the steps for that because it does improve the sound tremendously but if you want a little hack for these earbuds what i did is through on some eq on top of the sound id so depending on what music streaming service you use if you have access to a third-party equalizer if you do some adjustments within that eq it makes it sound even better and these can definitely handle it like i said the overall extension and just dynamic range that they're capable of is super impressive so overall the sound quality on these is absolutely amazing so when it comes to phone calls these are using a total of six microphones so let's go ahead and do a microphone test to give you guys an idea of the call quality alright so this is a microphone test of the one more evo true wireless earbuds right now we have quiet conditions testing testing one two three testing testing one two three now let's see how they sound once we add some background noise all right so now we got some crowd noise being played on a speaker so this should give you a rough idea as to how you would sound if you take cards in a noisy environment testing testing one two three testing testing one two three so overall if you're looking for a pair of earbuds to give you flagship level performance here in 2022 these should definitely be on your list of consideration the one more evo true wireless earbuds so again i will put

100,84qmGGT1erc,LG Tone Free TF8 Review | Waterproof True Wireless Sport Earbuds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84qmGGT1erc,Andy's Tech Tone, hi everyone and welcome to the channel lg have been quite busy lately as they did not only announce a new flagship set of wireless earbuds the tone 3t90 which is crammed with unique and useful features but they are launching another model as well which is more geared towards physically active users as it's more robustly built it has an ip67 waterproof rating it comes with ear wings for a secure fit during exercise and it shares most of the unique and handy features with the flagship model so in this video i'm going to test the lg tone free tf8 sport earbuds [Music] as for the design the tf8 offers all the typical sport earbud features first there are these large silicone earwings or fins which we get three sets of these fins can provide you with an extremely secure fit even during the most intense workouts the design of the fins allows the air to flow freely which can help with the comfort of your ears maybe it doesn't sound like much but if you ever pushed yourself close to your limits in training you know that every little thing that helps you keep cool can make a difference so that's clever thinking from lg and after a couple of runs and workouts i can safely say that the comfort and the fit of the tf8 are both first class another clever move was to make the earbuds dust and waterproof the ip67 rating can guarantee that even dropping your earbuds in dirt or drenching them in sweat can stop the bots from pumping out your favorite tunes and if they get sweaty or dirty you can simply rinse them under tap water but keep in mind that even though you can submerge the earbuds into water they won't work for swimming as the bluetooth signals will more than likely be cut off as soon as your head goes underwater but you can use them for water sports such as kayaking with a peace of mind the buds are made completely from plastic which results in a low enough weight of around 6 grams each build quality is premium and i know that it doesn't mean much as it's just a matter of personal taste but i find the tf8s look refreshing and that applies to the battery case too it has this textured coating all around which gives it a secure grip in your hands the color combination of metallic gray and lime green lends the case a dynamic and fresh look and there are a few more things that make the case somewhat unique well two things to be exact one is the uv nano technology and the other one is plug and wireless if you are interested in how exactly the uv nano technology works watch my t90 review as i explain it there in detail but in short the built-in uv light can reduce bacteria by up to 99.9 percent both on the speaker mesh and on the medical grade ear gels all you need to do is put the earbuds in the case close the lid and wait for at least 10 minutes and the uv nanotech will do the rest and since we talk about sportier buds which will more than likely be exposed to all sorts of dirt and bacteria in a workout scenario it's handy to have the ability to not only wash and clean the buds but to also properly sanitize them after each workout as this combination might prove to be essential in the long run as far as the health of your ears go with that said i just want you to make sure that the earbuds are completely dry every time before you put them away in the charging case as the case itself is not waterproof and on to the other unique feature of the case we get plugin wireless which can basically turn the case into a bluetooth transmitter how it actually works i will talk about in detail in just a minute so we got all these extras built into the case but there is one feature that didn't find its way to the sport bots from the t90 and that's the qi wireless charging support for a price of around 200 or 180 pounds one would expect a feature like that but all we get is a usb type-c port on the back of the case however the 10 hours of single charge play time with two full charges in the case sound kind of promising or at least these are the official numbers without anc with anc on it's 6 hours for the bots themselves and 18 hours in total and my own battery life tests can kind of confirm the manufacturer's data as on ios using the aac codec at 50 volume and with anc turned off i was able to use the earbuds for 9 hours and 42 minutes with the active noise cancelling feature turned on the single charge battery life dropped to 6 hours and 23 minutes these are good results as they are comparable to the best premium sport earbuds that are available on the market today a five minutes quick charge can give us an hour of views which can be used as a last resort before a workout when we realize our earbuds are dead just before starting a warm up before running by the way you do warm up every time before your workouts don't you well consider this a warm up so now we can move on to connection which is our main set for today's workout you know what i mean so first we get the latest 5.3 version of bluetooth with support for the sbc and the aac audio codecs pairing is easy with both android and ios devices i had no connection issues whatsoever during my own tests lag is non-existent with videos and you get a game mode switch in the app which can turn the sport earbuds into an esport gaming headset and even though we don't get all the fancy connection related features of the flagship t90 such as aptx adaptive or snapdragon sound i'm glad to see that lg kept two of them with the tf8 one is the multi-point and multi-pairing support which means that you cannot only connect to two devices simultaneously with automatic switching but you can also switch manually between the last five connected devices easily using the lg smartphone app and the other feature is the plugin wireless which turns the battery case into a bluetooth transmitter using either the 3.5 jack audio or the usb a to usbc digital cable you can connect basically any device to the case through its usbc port and then you just flick the switch on the side of the case and your earbuds are connected wirelessly to your source it can be particularly handy in a gym where there is a lot of equipment with a headphone jack so you can use the treadmill or the cross trainer with your bluetooth headset without having to deal with long cables tangling between your head and the machine so there is bluetooth 5.3 multi-point multi-pairing plug-in wireless and the bot can also be used in mono mode quite an impressive list of connection options if you ask me and now let me give you a quick audio sample from the dual mic setup on the tf-8q so you can hear how the bots perform during a phone call in a quiet room my voice sounds natural and it's easy to understand and that doesn't change significantly even when i turn on some loud ambient noise on the speakers in front of me the background noise is kept at bay and my voice is still relatively easy to understand apart from my accent maybe but it has nothing to do with the earbuds themselves and now i'm outside on a windy day standing next to a busy road so you can get an idea of what to expect from the spf apu in terms of voice transmission quality in such condition next up are the touch controls i know some of the hardcore fitness enthusiasts prefer having physical buttons on their earbuds as they tend to work better across all scenarios with sweaty fingers and whatever but i gotta say that the touch controls on the tf8 work extremely well i had no issues during everyday use or during my workouts either all sorts of functions are available such as playback track volume ambient mode and voice assistant controls and we can also remap all these functions in the app more details on that in my t90 review as the two things are basically the same i would only bring up one slight issue and that's that the touchpads are so sensitive and they are quite large in size too so the single tap action can be easily activated unintentionally during a workout but you cannot only deactivate the single tap action on each but independently but you can also lock the touch pads all together if that's what you want the same goes for the smart sensors and auto play pose you can disable it in the app so the bots won't pause media playback when you take them out of your ears and since we talk about the app already let's see what other features and settings are available in there first you will need to know that if intelligent sorting is enabled then the software will prioritize features that you use more frequently and display those on the top you can move around each feature manually yourself if that's something you would like to play around with so in my case now you can find the meridian audio presets or hsp modes on top with the two custom sound profiles below next are the three anc modes and the tone free lab which has the game mode switch and the uv nano switch inside further down you can find the menu for multi-point and multi pairing where you can do all sorts of connection wizardry such as switching between your previously connected devices including the battery case itself then there are some switches for the auto play pose the touchpad lock and the intelligent sorting and then you can find the touch control remapping menu the software update and the find my earbuds options the app has a wide range of settings and features and it's quite easy to use so the tone free app is another highlight of the airgtf8 buds the active noise cancellation on the other hand is a tiny bit underwhelming all we got is three modes a and c on a and c off and ambient modes to be fair there are two different ambient modes one that lets you hear all of your surroundings and another one which focuses on higher frequencies so you can hear human voices better and that feature is quite intense so you can carry out a conversation easily without having to remove the earbuds from your ears windows can get quite strong and distracting in either of the ambient modes and since sporty earbuds like the tf8 are meant to be used outdoors a lot that's quite an oversight on lg's part in my opinion there is no dedicated wind noise reduction mode so the second best option i found during some of my runs was turning the asc off completely so i could get rid of that whistling noise of course in this case you will lose some of the situational awareness which is at least questionable from a safety point of view but that's a trade-off you might need to make on windy days with the tf8 the noise cancelling performance itself is good and it's on par with the best premium sporty earbuds out there such as the beats feed pro the jaybird vista 2 or the jabra elite 7 active strangely enough the tf8 can handle higher pitch noises better than most but it struggles a little bit more than the average with those lower tone hums and rumbles but the overall noise cancelling experience with music on is very similar to other buds i just mentioned from its class and the six millimeter dynamic drivers can deliver the sound you would expect from a set of sport earbuds it has a robust bass with a good kick in the low end it's a powerful and rich sound with full of energy in the bottom octaves but that extra energy does not get carried over to the mid range as we get slightly recessed walkers and acoustic instruments that sound a touch less lively than what i would prefer there is nothing wrong with clarity but the sound is not quite as open or forward as an absolutely balanced presentation would require it to be and the highs while being present we don't get enough micro detail there and the highest frequencies feel like a bit tamed or rolled off a step too soon that's not necessarily a bad thing though as this sort of a tuning is perfectly suitable for workouts plenty of energy we can get from the base without the fatigue the shrilling highs could potentially cause and this is a winning combination towards the end of an intense workout where all you need is that energy without the extra fatigue if you know what i mean the sound stage is not the widest i've heard with only an average separation between the instruments and the imaging could be just a tad more precise too but i only got these results using the natural eq preset which is one of the five dsp or hsp modes meridian created specifically for lg with the immersive mode you can somewhat widen or expand the sound stage the treble boost can give you more extension in the higher octaves and the bass boost can make the bass response even stronger not that i personally ever needed it but you might prefer a bit more of a punch for your favorite workout playlist the 3d sound stage is the only one i wouldn't use as it sounds terrible in my opinion but the other four presets can give you a wide range of options as far as fine-tuning your earbuds and on top of all that you also get two custom eq profiles in the app where you can manually tweak the sound to your liking using the multiband equalizer and these options should be more than enough for almost everyone to make the tf8 sound the way they personally like the most maximum volume is plenty loud but there are louder earbuds on the market for sure and to conclude this review suffice it to say that i just found a new contender for my best sport earbuds of the year comparison because the lg tone free tf8 can deliver a great overall performance and it can offer a plethora of features among which there are a few unique ones too plug and wireless you we nano the ear wings and the ip67 rating are perfect examples of features that os port earbuds should come with in my opinion multipoint and anc are useful extras too however i wish that the engineers had put more effort into dealing with wind noise both on the hardware and on the software front but then there is the long enough battery life the secure and comfortable fit and the greatly customizable sound so it's certainly a complete package that is worth having a look at in case you are on the hunt for a new set of sport earbuds the price is 200 at the launch which is thirty dollars less than that of the edgy tone free t90 and in my personal opinion it makes the sport earbuds a better buy you might miss out on some extra features such as wireless charging optics adaptive or dolby atmos support but i'm willing to give up any of those for a more secure workout approved fit but that's just from somebody who uses sport earbuds mostly for exercise and maybe that's why i'm always somewhat biased towards sport earbuds however for more casual users the t90 is still a superior alternative but regardless of my personal taste it's obvious that lg upped their true wireless game with their latest release of two exceptionally feature rich earbuds and this was my review of the lg tone free tf-8 but before i sign off i have to tell you that i got free samples from edgy for this test but no money exchanged hands and nobody had any influence whatsoever on what i was saying to you about their product so if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already i talked a lot about the other newly announced lg buds so if you are interested in more details then go and watch my t90 review as well link is up there and also in the description thanks for watching see you next time you,lg tone tf8,The lg tone free tf8

101,zExw0KHUlss,These have a WORLD&#39;S FIRST - LG TONE Free T90 &amp; Fit TF8 Wireless Earbuds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zExw0KHUlss,ShortCircuit, y'all ready for this lg sponsored this video because they're trying to get in your head with the new tone free wireless earbuds there's two types guys the tone free fiat also known as the tf8 and the tone free non-fit also known as the t90qs don't call them that check out this cool knife that andy has he should sharpen this one so the t90q regular tone free is the more premium ones so let's open them first really digging this cardboard packaging it looks very compostable here we go and then what's under here oh a bunch of stuff this is your charging cable it's usb c to a and then here's a not regular thing it's a usbc to 3.5 millimeter like audio jack and this is interesting because it's a feature of the case on both of these earphones where let's say you're in a plane it doesn't have bluetooth or has really crappy bluetooth what you do is you plug the case into that source like your airplane armrest and then it'll feed in analog to here and then the case will act as the bluetooth transmitter to the earbuds that you're wearing so that is super cool and super useful when you're in a bind your phone dies or airplane mode or whatever you can watch movies not have to use some crappy other airline provided headphones that's awesome comes with some extra ear tips these are special ear gel tips that we'll talk more about in a minute and on the inside of this actually smaller than it looks in the picture case it's like these the size of like a what are those called macrons those expensive cookies weird there's like a little switch on it that looks like a audio jack i think that's probably to do with this guy there's your port and then there's a little uv nano light what i said about these these are i think called ear gel tips and they get cleaned by a light inside here so over the first 10 minutes of charging this light will shine and will clean the ear tip just the ear tip part which is pretty cool a little bonus i'd say wouldn't buy it for that but bonus 99.99 percent of bacteria killed by this light you can see the sounds by meridian these are pretty slick they're really glossy and smooth they're very light 5.5 grams on each earbud sporting a lot of battery life nine hours of playtime on the buds and their words not mine an extra 20 hours of juice in the cradle lg claims that these are super comfortable for all day listening and the lightness is a part of that now how do i pair them i guess i'm supposed to have these in here here they are connect set them up let's do it oh there's a user manual one touch is going to answer a call or player and pause touch twice to end a call and do volume control that's interesting uh i guess this will be a double tap on one for up a double tap on the other for down touch three times to play the three times for the next song you're breaking convention there usually that means back long press is for ambient sound noise cancelling on models that support it what's page two of this manual connect the cable i know how to charge you guys oh here's what these lights mean green light when you have more than 80 battery yellow light when you have 22 80 percent and red light when you have less than 20 you just want to stay in that yellow zone that's how you're going to preserve your battery life so if you're using the cable thing plugged in then your touch controls kind of change it'll be one touch for play and pause and touch twice for volume control and i get and that's about it yeah that makes sense you can't control the source as much as you could okay so there's some eq settings here immersive natural treble boost bass boost 3d sound stage natural mode delivers authentic and balanced sound that toast i can't read that fast it's gone now this is like the big feature of these dolby atmos head tracking on wireless earbuds let's do it earbuds track the direction of your head giving listeners the immersive feeling of i couldn't finish reading that guys i'm not a speed reader it's the feeling of being in a concert hall or a theater so the idea is that the audio is kind of fixed in place spatially so if i'm sitting in a home theater and i have surround speakers and i hear a little mosquito buzzing by over here i turn to look it's still going to stay there it's not going to track my ear that's what would happen with normal earphones so with these i can go what's that and look at nothing but it'll sound like i'm getting closer to it holy these are blasting right now these definitely go loud i'm only at halfway i don't even want to go this loud whoa this is super special he's like take that breath and it's like bouncing around like a different corners of my brain over the top that's pretty cool and he says i listen to music too loud tap tap it goes down a step tap tap goes down a step that's cool okay i'm looking forward the voice is kind of like right here my forehead now it's over here it's still there it's like there's a tiny weekend just standing on an invisible stage over there you know like in the songs the studio where he goes like this is a studio to different ears you can do that yourself every song can beat the studio you go i guess there's a cool feature with the noise cancellation where it will detect the sound around you the noise level of the sound around you and it'll ramp up or ramp down how aggressive the active noise counseling is you're walking down the street and suddenly you're in a construction zone what do you do don't fall down the hall it will increase the sound of the anc to compensate for that so that's cool there's two microphones on the outside and then there's two microphones on the inside for a total of four noise canceling mics on these bad boys of course there is a transparency mode so you can see in the app here it says noise canceling which is on right now always canceling off gives you a little kind of sound and ambient sound actually two different ambient sound modes have come up now this listening mode says you can hear ambient sound while listening to music or this conversation mode you can hear the voice more clearly i don't want to talk to people i want to listen to music yeah that works pretty well uh switching conversation mode uh yes jake bell you're doing a great job you're too far away dang that's too bad i wonder how you would sound if i turn this off hello i'm talking again you sound kind of the same another really cool feature that i've never used before is whisper mode so you can take one earbud out and basically just use it as a microphone looking really cool on the skytrain there's a guy over there he's only wearing one sock and so you're listening through one and you're and you're just speaking directly into another one so your mouth is that much closer to the microphone pretty cool and here is an audio recording of what the microphones sound like all four of them i can whisper a little bit i can get really gravelly or you know maybe i'm not used to that got em and that is them they have these cool graphene that's right the g word graphene drivers super stiff so that you know they're saying that makes it more accurate and less distortion very cool ipx4 rating which is pretty typical on wireless earbuds means that um you can sweat in these puppies they're gonna be fine some splashes they're okay however if you think for 229 you deserve more than ipx4 then you know what spend 200 and get the tone free fits with ipx7 when you put it in the wrong ones let's check out the tone freeze they're for fitness fitness this whole macro into my mouth hold on this is a different looking case it's bigger it's got a lot of same features it's got the little switch guy and the plug kind of different finish on it this is just really smooth and matte this is almost like woven but it looks super tight cool though very very fidgety oh look at that nice little lime inside and here they are they got the uv thing as well no dolby atmos on these things but you'll see that they do have this like special little little under the sea it's called swivel grip technology folks there's a lot of friction because that it's like this silicone fin and it's in contact with your ear across this entire length so it's really very secure sticky there they're in there damn it what if i had my hands tied behind my back i can't take them out they're just i'm under arrest and my ears are blocked look at that it says around the box ip67 i said x7 before that was wrong six seven so they do have maximum dust protection six is the highest rating of dust protection so yeah these things are hardcore they also have noise cancellation they also have the meridian audio how about battery life on these also 20 hours of juice in the cradle but a little more on the buds 10 hours on the buds and as i tap it it's going to take you're not connected to anything though but the surface that your finger lands on is pad just wants to land on that it's just like shaped like a finger boom all right that's it for these guys 200 for the tone free fits 229 dollars for the non-fits check them out at lg's website you can see that link below and thanks to lg for sponsoring this video if you didn't

102,f_B1bY7Yatg,LG TONE Free Fit TF8 : Wireless Earbuds Fit To Be King?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_B1bY7Yatg,Gamesky, all right guys so this video is sponsored by LG as this is the second pair of earbuds that we're going to talk about today and the pair that we're gonna check out is the new LG Tone free fit and more specifically the model is the tf8q now this pair comes in at 199 but the difference between this pair and the original tone freeze is this one is aimed more at being active this is a sport style earbud as it comes with ear fins that help keep these in your ears but it also comes in with an IP67 rating so uh not only is it dust proof it is also waterproof and that just kind of gives you peace of mind if you're going to be using these Outdoors which obviously this pair is aimed at so you don't have to worry if it starts to rain you don't have to worry if you sweat heavily and you still don't have to worry if you just happen to bump them out and they fall into the water so you generally don't get a waterproof rating with a pair that has active noise canceling let alone a pair that has very effective active noise canceling because I feel like the noise canceling on this pair is very comparable to other ones in this price range and it also has a very impressive ambient mode so again if you're going to be using these Outdoors you can hear your surroundings where it sounds pretty natural and it doesn't have that digital sound and it also has a chat mode which allows these earbuds to kind of focus in on somebody's voice somebody that you're talking to where it makes it easy to carry on a conversation without actually taking these earbuds out and some other features that these have is it does have the Google Fast pair and the Microsoft Swift pair so as soon as you pop open the lid to the earbuds if you have an Android phone you'll see the connection pop up right there on the screen and the same thing if you're using a Windows PC you'll see the connection pop up on the bottom right side of the screen and this just makes it easy to connect and get going and speaking of the connection this pair also has multi-point pairing so you can connect to more than one device at a time and I love this feature because if I'm watching a movie on a tablet or doing something on my PC and listening to something if a phone call comes in it will just allow me to easily switch over and take that phone call without having to go into settings and just manually disconnect from each device now this pair does have Bluetooth 5.3 and it doesn't have any high-end Bluetooth Kodak playback but it does have AAC and SBC and luckily throughout my testing I didn't have any kind of compression issues and I also didn't have any lag when it came to movies or videos now there is a slight lag with gaming but the huge plus with this pair is it does work with LG's app which not only allows you to keep these earbuds updated but it also has a gaming mode that you can switch these into and that just kind of helps cut down on any kind of lag and that just made things so much better even with using these with gaming but also within the app it has a find my earbuds feature so if you happen to misplace your earbuds it will help you locate them it also has some different EQ settings some pre-built ones that you can switch between you can also customize the EQ settings if you want now there's also a 3D sound mode which is trying to help open up the audio a little bit more and then also within the app it gives you the ability to switch between those different sound modes that I listed earlier you have your noise canceling on you can just turn it off you have the ambient mode and then you also have that chat mode if you're going to be where you need to hear somebody talking and another feature that this pair has just like LG's other Flagship earbuds is it has the plug and wireless mode so basically the charging case that this pair comes with it allows you to plug in the USBC cable and then on the other end you have a three and a half millimeter headphone jack where you can plug it into an airplane's headphone jack you can plug it into exercise equipment or a gaming device and it allows you to wirelessly transmit audio just simply by using the case and that's a huge Advantage because if you're in those situations normally a pair of true wireless earbuds will not allow you to be able to use them but just by having that feature and being able to switch it on on the case just makes it that much more convenient now as far as what they've included Inside the Box you do get three sets of the ear gels they've also included three sets of the ear fins which again make it really convenient to keep these in your ears they've included the three and a half millimeter to USBC cables so that again you can plug these into devices that have a normal headphone jack and then as far as the charging cable it comes with a USBC cable and one thing that I found is very puzzling as to why it's not a feature on these earbuds this pair doesn't have Qi wireless charging and that's very confusing especially for repair that's in this price range but speaking of the charging battery life is very impressive but it's also a huge gap between using these with the noise canceling off and the noise canceling on because if you just use these with the noise canceling turned off you can get about 10 hours of battery life on the earbuds with about 30 hours total using the case but if you just use these with the noise canceling left on that brings the battery life down to about six hours on the earbuds and about 18 hours using the case so that is a huge gap but that also shows you that the noise canceling is very effective on this pair but if you do happen to pick the earbuds up and they are dead there is a fast charge feature although a very minimal one where a five minute charge will get you an hour's worth of use now moving over to looking at the case I do like the textured grip that it has on the outside it just allows you to have a better grip on the case and on the back you can see the USBC input for charging and then around on the side it has that switch that I was talking about earlier that allows you to put these into that three and a half millimeter under wired mode and then around on the front you have a single indicator light and this is what allows you to gauge how much battery life is left on the case now moving over to looking at the earbuds unlike LG's other Flagship models this pair does not have the stem style design it just has the simple earbud design and again because of that ear hook it makes it a very comfortable pair but also a pair that you don't have to worry is going to fall out of your ears the controls on this pair does use touch controls and because it works with LG's app you can go in and switch around some of the controls so that you can have control over everything that you need your play pause skipping your tracks forward going backwards and also your volume control but if you're going to have those controls do keep in mind you may have to sacrifice the ability to have your noise canceling and ambient mode switch so you might have to go into the app to actually do that when you need it but another feature is this pair does have have these smart sensors so if you do take your earbuds out of your ears it will just automatically pause and then once you put them back in it will just go back to what you were listening to now for you guys that do like to use your earbuds for phone calls just like the other LG models I feel like these do a very good job of picking up my voice and I also think even in noisy environments these do an excellent job of blocking out my surroundings but you guys can be a judge by listening to a test here so here is the mic test using the LG Tone free fit and again just like with the other LG models I think it picks up my voice very cleanly it does have a slight warm tone to it but this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call and so now here's the mic test for the crowd noise being played which you can hear here so this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call in the public so now let's talk about the sound and one thing that I found very interesting because you normally don't see this is LG has it where the bass boost EQ setting is turned on out of the box and again I think that's because this pair is geared more towards being a sport or athletic style earbud because usually you want something that's going to have a very Dynamic Sound which means a Punchy bass a bright treble and just something that's a little more in your face if you're going to be working out but even though the bass boost mode is on out of the box this is not a overly bloated type of bass it has plenty of punch to it but it's fairly quick it's not sitting around and it's not rolling over the mids and the highs because the mids came through clearly no matter what genre I was listening to and the treble has a very nice clean overall sound now this is not a bright or harsh treble I would basically say that they took the EQ curve and boosted the base halfway but they also kind of pulled the treble halfway to kind of balance that out and they only slightly boosted the mids just so that it didn't get buried especially if you're listening to something chaotic I mean I even think this pair sounded great with metal and some more chaotic genres it just didn't get congested or muddy and that leads to the fact that one thing that's very impressive about this pair is the Sound Stage and the sound Imaging now usually a dynamic sounding pair of earbuds tend to sound a little bit more closed in but this pair has a lot of space to it it is a very open sounding earbud and I think they did an excellent job of being able to tell where different sounds are coming from so my overall opinion is yes at 200 it's putting itself up there against a lot of the mid to Upper tier true wireless earbuds it is very puzzling the fact that this pair does not have Qi wireless charging which which I don't really understand the fast charge even though it does have one I feel like it's on the lower scale we've seen better on a lot of other models out there but I think the huge selling point is you're getting a sport pair of earbud that has very impressive active noise canceling it is completely waterproof which you normally don't see with a noise canceling pair of earbuds and a lot of the other things like the gaming mode if you're going to use these for media and that wired mode being able to plug into devices on top of just using these as a normal pair of true wireless earbuds is bringing some other features that those other earbuds in this price range don't have so I think from an athletic standpoint this is going to be considered one of the higher tier models that you can get and I think that they're bringing enough to the table and have a very impressive audio quality to Warrant that price tag but guys that wraps up my video on the brand new LG Tone free it again the model on these is the tf8qs thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay tuned for more,lg tone tf8,This is the second pair of earbuds that we're going to talk about today and the model is the new LG Tone free fit.The model is the tf8q now this pair comes in at 199 but the difference between this pair and the original tone freeze is this one is aimed more at being active.This is a sport style earbud as it comes with ear fins that help keep these in your ears but it also comes in with an IP67 rating. This pair of earbuds comes with three sets of the ear gels and three sets of the ear fins.They also have a fast charge feature where a five minute charge will get you an hour's worth of use.The charging battery life is very impressive but it's also a huge gap between using these with the noise canceling off and the noise canceling on.If you do take your earbuds out of your ears it will just automatically pause and then once you put them back in it will just go back to what you were listening to now. Review of the LG Tone free true wireless earbuds.Voice test: Very good job of picking up my voice and even in noisy environments these do an excellent job of blocking out my surroundings.Sound test: Punchy bass a bright treble and just something that's a little more in your face if you're going to be working out.
103,cy4bC4or8Ho,LG TONE Free Fit TF8 Unboxing &amp; Hands-On Walkthrough,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy4bC4or8Ho,TechTablets, these are algae's first sports earbuds they are  called the tone free fits or the tf8qs they do   have a and c now with that anc on you get up to  six hours of run time on a single charge and then   18 including the case now if you turn off the anc  then you get a very long 10 hours of run time on a   single charge and 30. now they are ip67 waterproof  so you don't have to worry about getting them wet   you can even clean them and wash them down with  water if you happen to get a bit of sweat on them   or something or dirt it's not going to be an issue  they are tuned by meridian we do have with these   a plug-in feature that you can actually run them  with older tech so imagine you've got a psp but   it doesn't have bluetooth but you want to use them  or you can use the cable that's supplied plug them   in and you're able to use them so a handy little  feature there they also do have their uv nano plus   so now it has improved so it's actually just  killing the bacteria that are on the tips the   whole silicon tips and also the mesh inside now  i did want to make it very clear full disclaimer   that this is a video sponsored by lg so it is  just an unboxing and hands-on included in the box   obviously we have the time free fits they've got a  type c to usb cable type a type c 2 3.5 millimeter   some swivel grips so they are air hooks you use  those we'll try different ones out to get the best   fit for your ears and then we do have some medical  grade silicone tips so two smalls two large and   a simple owner's manual these earbuds according to  my scales they weigh six grams each and your total   travel weight with the case is 56 grams the case  is really nice high quality it's got this texture   to it as you can see feels good in hand and what  i do like about it is it doesn't seem to scratch   that easily or pick up fingerprints so there is  a magnet that does hold the lid in place and it's   got a nice feeling to it when you open it up and  when it closes it won't just flop open and if i do   give it a bit of a shake there is no rattling that  is happening at all so we do have two status leds   here the one at the front will tell you the case  battery life there is the one there that states   uv nano so that is to do with the uv lights that  are inside those lights are not these blue leds   that you currently see it is the one right in  there so what it does is it does kill all of   the bacteria when it's charging and it activates  it takes 10 minutes all the bacteria that is just   on the tip and then the mesh inside then along  the back we have our type-c port those magnets   do keep the earbuds in there really secure and  it does feel nice when you place them in and it's   very easy to tell them apart they are labeled  left and right on the back so pogo port pin   connector right there for of course charging them  so the build quality of the earbuds is very good   the plastic i do like there are no sharp edges  so this is interchangeable what they call their   swivel grip which is an air hook there so the  idea is that that fits in really snug into your   ear and it's not going to go anywhere when you're  running when you're jumping up and down and it   does have the little slots in there the gaps for  ventilation a little bit so it's to help keep your   ear a little bit cooler so these silicone tips as  mentioned they are medical grade ones and we do   have a little mesh that's in there to cover over  that so it doesn't end up getting wax inside or   anything like that so there's a sensor right here  that is used for the auto play and pause when you   pull them out or put them back in so it can start  there got microphones capacitive touch controls on   the back another microphone there that you can see  one at the top and overall the plastics used are   good it seems to be like a painted plastic there  and so far using them it hasn't marked or anything   and our application for them so it is called algae  tone free the app and you see straight away our   battery life of the fits that turn three fits and  then the case has 47 percent there they do have a   guide okay that's how to insert them you just need  to swivel them up a little bit to make sure that   they have a solid fit and there's other things  like the capacitive touch controls too by the way   so it's good that it's got all this information  built into it and it even gives you their guide   on the charging case status led to let you know  at first glance what you have remaining with its   battery life you've got equalizer settings for  some reason out of the box they put it onto base   boost i guess for the general public so people  will like the way they sound that the oh these   are bassy but you do have here some custom presets  as well that you can go along and just tweak that   firmware updates there has been one already good  to see and we've got our settings here for the anc   and the ambient modes you can do it via the  app or you can do it via the touch controls   multi-point and multi-pairing so you can turn  this on you can have up to five different devices   using the app that you can connect these up to  which is really good another nice little handy   feature to have the autoplay pause and there's  quite a few other settings in there as you can   see so it's quite a fully featured app onto our  audio now with them so we do have the aac codec   support which most phones will be using with  this so iphones ios and then android phones most   of them do support aac if whatever you're using  doesn't support it then you fall back to the sbc   codec which is not quite as high quality so if you  can do try to use aac so that tune as i mentioned   before is by default set to the bass boost mode  now they only have six millimeter drivers within   them but the tune is from meridian and that's  british company they've got many many years   in tuning audio experience uh and well i think  it's a very good tune that they have gone through   for here with these so the balanced more natural  mode preset i do prefer because they haven't gone   a little bit well they haven't obviously bolstered  up those lows and it does sound yes as it states   it is more balanced which is quite a good tune  but there's a lot of different presets in there   and i think all different genres of music which  of course i've been listening to with these they   do sound good considering that these are fit  active sports style earbuds the algae tone free   fits of course the tf i think most people will be  happy with the way they do sound those lows the   mids vocals highs aren't very detailed that's one  area where i would say they lack a little bit how   about streaming content and the latency is there  a noticeable big delay well with using this phone   here which is powered by the qualcomm snapdragon  8 gen 1. i don't really see that much of a delay   a split second sometimes with streaming content  so stranger things things right here with netflix   it's fine i think it's acceptable for watching  content like this however when you game though you   will notice a bit more of a delay with the latency  which is normal i've also been out now for a bit   of a jog to test out how these fear the algae tone  free fits so they haven't popped out on me once   they do feel secure they fit in there really nice  so you can jump up and down like now they're not   going to pop out on me i don't feel like i need  to keep pressing them in and just a bit of a run they are not going anywhere and because they  do have an ipx67 waterproof and dust resistant   i don't actually need to worry about them  getting sweat on them not an issue at all   here is now an audio sample with the lg tone 3  fits the tf8 cues so they do have some active   noise cancellation going on and the voice quality  should be reasonably clear as you can hear i don't   think it's that bad so if you are running along  and you have to answer a call with them of course   you are able to do so so it should be removing  some of the background noise you can hear from   my tower pc and the air conditioning fan unit that  i have up on the wall like most of these bluetooth   earbuds now when you open the case they have  already pretty much paired up with your phone so   inserting them in just give them a little bit  of twist when you put them in the air hooks   for me the mediums have worked the medium silicon  tips with my ears of course everyone's different   so make sure you get a good seal anc the anc on  these works really well i cannot hear background   noises like noisy cicadas outside singing away  noisy fan towel pc completely blocked out now   one thing to note with the ip67 water resistance  that it does have that of course you don't need to   worry about getting them wet you can even wash  them down with water after they're all sweaty   now if they do detect they've got a bit of water  in them they turn on a very high pitched frequency   just to help get that water out of them completely  to really just empty them out from where that   driver is if you do get a little bit in there so  it's six millimeter driver tuned by meridian so   i really i like the tune of these i think  for sports earbuds they are good so they've   got a lot of features we've got the anc  you've got of course the ambient noise mode   we have the uv killing the uv nano there  to kill the bugs on the tips and the inside   mesh that's great and the wired mode very  handy with the case so you can use it with   older tech so they really do have a lot on offer  excellent build quality and if you're not using   the anc all the time maybe you're running and  you don't want to block out background noises   then you get up to 10 hours on a single charge  so fantastic battery life with these so thank   you so much for watching this video hands  on of algae's new tone free fits the tf8q,lg tone tf8,These are algae's first sports earbuds they are called the tone free fits or the tf8qs they do have a and c now with that anc on you get up to six hours of run time on a single charge.They are ip67 waterproof so you don't
