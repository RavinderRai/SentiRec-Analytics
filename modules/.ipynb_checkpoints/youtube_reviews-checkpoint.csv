sony xm4 earbuds," The Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, which is a mouthful
of a name, sit towards the top of the earbuds market in terms of price and quality, but
are they good enough to justify their $279 US dollar price? And why would you get them over the AirPods
Pro or the new Sony Linkbuds S? I'm going to answer all of those questions
and I'll go into why these buds have become my favorite to use over the past six months. Now, the first thing that sets the Sony XM4
earbuds apart from me from other earbuds that I've used is their fit. Unlike other buds like the AirPods Pro and
Beats Fit Pro that I’ve tried where part of their plastic housing sits closer into
your ear canal, only the tip of the Sony XM4s goes into your ears, similar to the design
philosophy Google has used in their Pixel Buds design. This results in the Sonys being surprisingly
comfortable to wear for in-ear buds. Now even though these are in-ear earbuds,
which means they create a seal in your ear canal. Sony has actually outfitted them, in their
design, with a spatial vent. And that eliminates that plugged ear feeling
you can get with other types of earbuds. Another thing that helps makes these buds
comfortable is the polyurethane foam material the noise isolation tips are made out of. And this helps give these buds the absolute
best noise cancellation. I've experienced on a pair of earbuds. In fact, they're comparable to over the air
headphones, like my AirPods, Max Bose 700s, and even the new Sony XM5s and to see our
long-term reviews of those headphones as well as our upcoming reviews of the WXM5s and Sony
Linkbuds S, make sure you subscribe to the channel. Now over the past six months, I found myself
picking up these earbuds over almost every other audio device I own because their noise
cancellation is great. And they've got a slim profile and they're
great for situations like going out on a walk, they'll cut out on traffic noise so I can
still hear my music and podcasts. They also have wind noise detection, which
hasn’t been perfect, but does seem to keep the wind noise to a minimum when noise cancellation
is enabled. Also, these buds feature a transparency mode,
which you can just tap to enable and the buds will use their external microphones to pump
in sound from your surrounding environment, so you can hear what's going on around you. It's not the best transparency mode I've ever
used, like on the AirPods Max, but it's still pretty good and the mic quality on these buds,
by the way, I would say they're about maybe a little bit above average, but they're not
the best for phone calls that I've ever used, but it'll still get you by. Now, the next feature I absolutely love about
these buds is their sound quality. It's excellent. Then XM4s have 6mm custom drivers which give
them great bass, clarity, and overall, they have one of the best sound profiles of any
buds I’ve tried. They also support Sony’s LDAC codec which
gets you higher quality audio over bluetooth. LDAC is supported on many Android devices
but if you have an iPhone, you’re out of luck and stuck with just the AAC codec. Another great use case I found for these buds
is actually while cooking. And I think this has probably become my number
one use case for them because their noise cancellation is so good. It still allows me to fully listen to music
or a podcast while I'm cooking and making noise like banging pots around or sizzling
meat or vegetables on a skillet etc. And the come with and IPX4 water resistance
rating, so if you get a few splashes on them while cooking or if you wear them in the rain,
you should be fine. Now, another scenario, I use these buds for
a lot is when I podcast and clean. And again, this is due to the noise cancellation,
but it's also due to their slim profile with your ears, unlike over the ear headphones,
when you wear something like the AirPods Max or Sony WXM5s, I'm always worried about when
I'm cleaning that I'm going to bang them into something and nick part of the headphone. But with these earbuds because they're so
slim, you don't have to worry about that at all when you're cleaning around the home. Now the next feature I've really enjoyed about
these earbuds that has been great is their multi tap gestures. The earbuds have a touch surface that can
register a single, double, or triple tap, plus a long press, which is something most
other buds I’ve tried just can’t do, expect for the Pixel Buds. You can customize what you want each tap to
register as in the Sony app. I have mine setup so you tap once for play/pause,
twice to skip forward, and three times to skip back, and long press for the phone assistant
on the right bud, and I’ve setup the left bud to control the noise cancellation. So one tap for noise cancelation, another
tap for transparency mode. The Sony app, it’s a bit weird but overall
it does allow you to do what you want. The weird thing about it is they stuck in
a badge system to try and reward you for using the product more, which is stupid.You know
what will make people want to use a product more? You make a good ****** product that people
want to use. Lucky enough for Sony, they did that with
these. Another issue a lot of people run into with
buds in general is their connection. With these buds, I haven’t had any issues
with their connection with the many devices I’ve tested them with, and their range is
very good. I can have music playing on my phone a few
rooms away and still listen to everything on these buds without any cutouts. When the buds finally need a charge, their
case has wireless charging built in which I’ve found convenient and they also have
USB-C. I’ve never run out of battery while listening
to these and they’re rated for 8 hours of battery and the charge in the case will get
you up to another 16 hours. They also support quick charging, so 5 min
of charge will get you 60 mins of listening time if you’re in a bind. The battery case makes it very easy to tell
when they need a charge because the large LED at the front will glow amber when you
take the buds out of the case and it’ll remain amber after you close the case. The only thing I think this case is missing
is a button to press for bluetooth pairing, like the new Sony Linkbuds S case has. To bluetooth pair the earbuds you need to
put them in your ears and then press and hold both buds until you hear an announcement that
you’ve entered bluetooth pairing mode. In terms of size, the case is smaller than
the previous generation of Sony’s buds and come in a better shape in my opinion. Though it’s still a bit larger than an AirPods
case, however, it’s small enough to still fit in my pants’ inner pocket comfortably,
so I haven’t had any qualms about the size. Now, speaking of AirPods, let's talk about
why I think you would go with the Sony buds over Apple's noise canceling AirPods, The
AirPods Pro. I think you would go with the XM4s over the
AirPods Pro if you want buds that have better noise cancellation, a more comfortable fit,
a longer battery life, and because they come in both black and silver where the AirPods
only come in one color. Now, the Sonys are missing a few features
that AirPods get you as an Apple user, mainly automatic switching between Apple Devices,
better mic quality, and spatial audio Now if you're an Android user, I think these
are a no-brainer if you want a solid pair of noise canceling earbuds with some of the
best noise cancellation you can probably get in a pair of earbuds right now. The buds also support Google’s one tap fast
pair and overall, they’ve worked great on my Samsung and Pixel phones, plus with Android
you get LDAC quality streaming. The main question I think for Android users
with these buds is why would you go with these over the Sony Linkbuds S? The Linkbuds S recently came out from Sony
at $199 US dollars and have noise cancellation which isn’t as good as the XM4s, a shorter
battery life, slightly worse audio quality, and no case with wireless charging, but they’re
$80 cheaper and are generally even more comfortable to wear with a slimmer profile. I certainly think these are going to be tempting
for those who don't need or want the absolute best noise cancellation in a set of earbuds
like the XM4s and would rather save 80 US dollars. Next, let's talk issues. After six months of using these earbuds, the
only issue I ever ran into is when I had them in and I turned transparency mode on, on occasion
it would just turn off transparency mode without any input from me. I think this is likely due to Sony’s adaptive
sound controls feature switching between the walking and still/sit settings, but turning
that feature off fixed the issue. Generally I’ve been impressed with the sound
controls feature and it can be useful to pump in more ambient noise from the outside world
when I go on a walk, versus when the buds detect I’m just sitting down. And you can also take this feature one step
further by enabling location tracking, so the Sony app can learn your sound preferences
based on your location, But overall, since I basically work from home and just walk in
the surrounding area, I haven't really utilized that feature. So that’s everything I like and dislike
about the Sony WF-XM4s, now let’s talk recommendations. Are they worth the $279 price that they retail
for? Well to me, they are absolutely the best earbuds
I have used in terms of noise cancellation and they have a fantastic eight-hour battery
life. So to me yes, they have absolutely been worth
that price. However, given Sony has recently released
the Linkbuds S, I think a lot of people may for those instead.. Now I've only had the Linkbuds S for about
a week now, so I can't give you a definitive opinion yet on whether or not I think it's
fine to go with these over the XM4s or if the XM4s are definitely worth that extra $80
US dollars, but I'll be sure to do that in the full review of the Linkbuds S. So make sure you subscribe to the channel

sony xm4 earbuds," (wind rushing)
(slow music) - As much as I love the AirPods Pros, I have to admit that daily driving them with an Android phone is
not the greatest experience. Not because Apple couldn't make it so, but because they choose not to. Oh no, you aren't enough our customer, you have to buy more of our products to deserve to be able
to update your firmware. Which is why I'm super, super excited about Sony's WF-1000XM4s. They need a better name for these things. It's like, do I want AirPods
Pro, or do I want WF-1000XM4? I'm really hoping that
I want the WF-1000XM4. These have Sony's new
integrated V1 processor, which is supposed to give them much better active noise cancellation than their previous generation product. They also have actually a
comparably-sized battery case compared to the AirPods Pros. Look at that, it is a little bit thicker, but the most important thing is whether it passes the
little pocket test for me. Okay, Dennis, little pocket test. Ah, it's a little bulky.
It's a little bulky. Here's the AirPods Pros for context. - [Crew Member] No one uses that pocket. - [Linus] Yes they do,
they use them for AirPods, I'm starting this trend. (crew laughing) I'm a trendy kind of guy. Charging is handled with USB type C. And opening it up, we can see a little charge
indicator right there, and the earphones themselves. Okay, so much like most
other wireless earphones, they've got these little
pushpin connectors that charge the actual
earphones themselves. So you're supposed to get eight hours with active noise cancellation enabled, and then another 16 hours
from the battery charging case for a total of 24. Why do I keep comparing
them to the AirPods Pro? Because, spec for spec,
they're pretty darn close. Now we actually got two
versions, we got the white one, and then we also got this press
kit that has the black one. And I wanted to see both because, as much as I like the AirPods Pros, I don't like the color,
I don't think anything that you stick in your
ear should be white, and I would really rather
have black earphones, so this is the one I'm most excited about. Okay, so here's the color. Ooh. Okay, I can see how people could get into the kind of earthy-toned white ones. I wouldn't even call it
white, it's more of like... It reminds me of stone,
kind of a stone color. But the black ones look pretty sharp. Oh, look at that. All recyclable packaging paper. What do we got in here? Okay, so they come with the
medium tips pre-installed, and then they also include small
and large ones color-coded, and you get a type C charging cable. I don't know if my high expectations are because I think they will be good or because I'm just really,
really hoping that they're good. Let's start with just a fit test. Interesting, they're using
a memory foam style ear tip. The advantage of these is they provide an excellent seal against the ear canal with very little noise bleed, but the disadvantage is
that they are not the best in terms of durability. Now apparently they've got
four microphones total now, so two on each one. One microphone on the outside, that's gonna be for hearing
ambient sound around you that it needs to cancel. Oh wow, this noise canceling kicked in. I can barely hear myself talk now. I mean, I can inside my
own head, but that... Just everything went away. And then they have a second
microphone on the inside for checking that the noise
canceling is working well. So the four of them all work together. Let's go ahead and get
these paired, though, and then we'll try it out. Look at that, just
showed right up. Connect. The ANC on these is eerily good. Like, I... - [Crew Member] Can you
hear what I'm saying? - I mean, I can tell you're
talking, Brandon, but I... - [Brandon] You can't really hear me? - I can read your lips, I
can't really understand. - [Brandon] I'm speaking
at a normal volume but you can't hear me. - Just barely. - [Brandon] Wow! - It's pretty good in terms of the pressure feeling on my ears as well. I would say it is maybe not quite as good
as the AirPods Pros, but it's also a significantly stronger active noise canceling effect, that's really, really impressive. I would say a lot of
that probably comes down to using the foam style ear tips rather than like a
silicone style ear tips. But obviously the microphone type plays into it very heavily as well. So when I'm running it's gonna
let ambient sound through. And then you can decide exactly what level of ambient sound
you want to allow through. So all the background noise of
the warehouse just went away, but what if I talk to Jono? - [Jono] Hey, how you doing? - Yeah, I can hear you, but it's quiet. If I had music on, I probably
wouldn't be able to hear you. Sorry, the noise canceling, sorry, what? - [Jono] Send your ear pics. - Send your ear pics, that's creepy! - [Voice Assistant] Remove
the headphones from your ears. Next, turn your face forwards and fit it within the frame on the screen. Please move the camera
away from your head. Turn your head slowly to the right. Captured photo. - [Linus] What the? That's my left ear, apparently. Hold on, why don't we try that again? Okay, got my ear that time. - [Voice Assistant] Please capture photo. - Analyzing your ears, this will take approximately 30 seconds. This video is brought to you by MANSCAPED.

prioritize sound quality, so it'll use the highest
quality codec that it can. It does support LDAC,
so that's pretty sweet. Or you can prioritize a
more stable connection. And then I found out what DSE extreme is, so maybe I don't have to reactivate my Apple Music subscription, because supposedly it'll
actually use the V1 processor to upscale more lossy files. So here we go. This is great. All the EQ presets you
could want, or just off. You can set a couple of
custom ones. That's awesome. Wait, manual, how do I adjust it? I can't do it. Okay, well whatever,
if that actually works, then I guess it'll be pretty neat. These sound great. Like, they sound really good. Punchy, not overdone,
great clarity in the highs. Now I feel like I gotta
throw in the AirPods Pros just to kind of side-by-side them. The AirPods Pros, to be
clear, are not the benchmark against which all headphones are measured, they're not great sounding headphones. But what they are is excellent active noise
cancellation earphones that are super convenient. Oh wow, by comparison these just seem like I don't even have noise cancellation on. The difference is way
more-er than I thought when I hadn't side-by-sided them yet. Man, I don't know if I can go back. The case is kinda thicker, though, which is a pain in the butt. And they're not cheap,
they're almost 300 US dollars. Type C charging, though, means I no longer have to have
lightning cables in my life. But then, I rarely use lightning anyway. Do they have wireless charging? They do have wireless charging. Okay. They're just not really that comparable, to be honest with you. But there's more to
earphones than sound quality, and what Apple does
really well is ergonomics. These are so comfortable, and something that I do that
probably most people don't is I sleep with earphones in every night. They are, they're not as comfortable. The tighter seal against the ear, the fact that they're so bulky... So you can see, the size
difference is marked. All right, let's try the other thing. So apparently they've really tuned it to deal with wind noise. Select this if wind noise is bothersome. Using this function shortens
continuous playback time. So I guess I'm not supposed
to be able to hear that fan. Oh yeah. Oh wow, it works really well. So I'm getting that exact
same effect, the (vocalizes), kinda sounds like someone flapping a flag in the wind or something as the wind passes over the mic. Oh, that's really cool. So the noise cancellation is what takes away the actual whirring, but then the wind noise
reduction is what takes away the (vocalizes) sound of the
wind blowing over the mic. That works surprisingly well. I really like these. I'm impressed. I think I'm gonna try and make the switch, 'cause they really do sound a lot better. So grab the short circuit. The case pin also is not
as ... it's all right. This is so satisfying as a fidget toy. This is like, yeah, it's all right. That's a very minor gripe, obviously."
sony xm4 earbuds, [Music] what's going on guys it's your average consumer and today we're finally going to be taking a look at the sony wf-1000x m4s yes it's a mouthful as always but these are sony's latest and most advanced earbuds yet but the question is is it worth the 279 dollars that sony's asking for but before we get into these let's actually talk about the unboxing experience so these actually come with some pretty compact packaging once you pop the top you're immediately greeted by the earbuds within their case followed by some packaging with a quick start guide on it with some paperwork inside underneath the paperwork you'll get access to the extra accessories which consist of a short usbc cable as well as some small and large ear tips and of course the earbuds have the medium size on them so you can pick which fits best for you and what's interesting here is that sony seems to have gone with a memory foam ear tip similar to what we've seen with like the compli foam tips which means these should provide a pretty good seal which is important for in-ear buds but when you get to the actual buds within the case i gotta say these feel pretty premium which is what the wf line is all about but let's go ahead and talk about what these actually sound like and how they perform so that's what you get in the box but how is it to actually use these right so first of all let's talk about how these things look sony went with an all-new design over here these are smaller than the previous version the previous version was a little big definitely noticeable when in the ear and while these themselves aren't very tiny once they're inside the ear i feel like it's definitely fine these look too big carl jay so there you have it you guys better than the last ones in terms of overall like comfort when you're throwing them inside of your ears i find them very comfortable once you get them like snug but i always find that whenever i'm trying to put them in i have to do a bit of adjusting so it's not just like a pop them in the ear and go well that that one's fine but i usually find myself having to go like this and then doing a little shimmy here to get it in just right and nice tight seal but overall i think i like what sony did here i feel like these are a good looking pair of truly wireless earbuds they're a little on the thick side but for all the tech that's inside of it you seriously can't complain overall i do think that these are a good looking pair of earbuds and you know once you get them inside of the ear they're pretty secure now the only thing about these is that if you like to lay down with your earbuds some people do some people fall asleep with their earbuds in they're still a bit bulky so you might not be able to do that super comfortably like you can't lay your head on it so something to keep in mind for those of you folks who do it now the color here i have is the black and copper which sony's been doing for a while and it looks really good but they also have i believe like this silver i think they call it silver but it's like a it's not even white jay it's like dark remember the the headphones are like a beige like a dark beige it's kind of like that i'm assuming it's the same color but it's their silver version this case itself is probably a slightly bit bigger than the airpods pro uh but not enough for someone to feel like they can't take these around i could throw these in my pocket oh snap i didn't even put it in this little pocket i could put these in any of my jeans pockets and you know it's not even a thought definitely comfortable to bring around and since we're on the topic of the case this is the charging case so when you store these in here they automatically charge and of course you'll get an extra 16 hours of battery life i believe you get eight hours with active noise canceling from the earbuds themselves and an additional 16 hours once you keep charging them in the case and the case is cool because you got a usb c port in the back but what's even better is the fact that this supports wireless charging so you can just throw it on top of a wireless charger uh you don't lay it on its back or anything just stand it up and boom you'll have wireless charging i think it's great that sony added that functionality in here without making it a gigantic case and you get this cool little led light in the front so that you can know it's charging or if the battery is low you have a solid idea of what's going on with the earbuds and eight hours of battery life with active noise cancelling is really really good i think with the total of 24 hours with active noise canceling on that's kind of like the standard but the earbuds themselves being able to hold eight hours is awesome that's like almost powerbeats pro level and of course you get a lot more battery if you don't use active noise canceling now what makes these the most advanced earbuds that sony has ever come out with well there's a few things and this is like with every 1000x review that we do whether it's the headphones or the earbuds sony has a slew of features and tech built into these things that we can just spend all day talking about but we'll just talk about some of the main things first active noise cancelling on these amazing i've been using the airpods pro for a long time now and i've been using the active noise canceling on those with no issue and these are better these sound better and that's also due to the fact that we've got these new ear tips so there's kind of like a memory foam kind of ear tip here so it'll conform to your ear shape which is nice uh but it also helps to create a better seal so you have a better seal inside of the ear so less sound is coming in so when you have that active noise canceling on you're not getting any like you know extra sounds from the outside that you physically can't stop uh these do a really good job just making sure everything sounds as muted as possible so i'll say it here best active noise canceling earbuds that i've used so far uh they've also got a transparency mode or what sony calls ambient sound mode for apple users that's like the transparency mode on the airpods pro airpods pro are still king in transparency mode simply because it just sounds so natural when the airpods pro in your ear it almost feels like there's nothing there with these because you have that memory foam ear tip it feels like something's in your ear still but i can still hear everyone around me very clearly i think this is sony's best version of their ambient noise feature so you can definitely hold conversations with no problem uh it'll sound pretty natural but after apple i feel like these are probably the second best ambient noise earbuds that are on the market right now they've also got this pretty cool feature called speak to chat which is actually pretty impressive i recently used it while me and jay were in an uber uh i was listening to some music and whenever i needed to say something to jay i'd say something it kicks on the ambient noise mode automatically from hearing my voice it'll pause the music and then you're able to have your conversation and once you're done it'll kick right back on i will say though if you're using the speak to chat feature change the time that it takes to close out the feature from the standard 15 seconds over to the short five seconds because if you have it for 15 seconds after your conversation is done for your music to kick back on you're just kind of sitting there left with your thoughts and you're just like in this weird area where you're just like where's my music but i will say it's a bit of an awkward feature because it doesn't activate based on someone else's voice it only activates based on yours so if someone comes up to you and they start talking you're it's not going to immediately cut off your music is still going to be playing so you'll either have to say wait what'd you say like just something to prompt the feature to turn on or you'll end up having to take out the earbuds themselves so if someone else is initiating the dialogue it's a little bit weird using it but when you are the one initiating dialogue it's just fine now we really start to see how advanced these earbuds are within the companion app there's a section called adaptive sound control and there you've got some pretty surprising features so these are actually able to detect what kind of actions you're taking so if you're walking running and it'll shift the noise canceling or adaptive sound to whatever works best for those situations so if you're outside running it can detect that you're running and you'll probably want to hear your surroundings so it'll automatically switch to the ambient sound mode so that you can hear if like maybe there's a car coming if you're maybe just sitting somewhere you can have like active noise canceling come on it's supposed to intelligently pick the best feature for you what's also kind of cool is that these can detect the locations that you frequent so if you maybe take the train a lot uh it can learn that you take the train and then turn on the active noise canceling whenever you're on in the train station or something you can even go into the app and register certain locations you can use a map to say when i'm here i want this to come on uh when i'm over there i want that to happen so that's just a lot of control that you don't usually expect usually it's just like yo turn on active noise cancelling turn it off that's usually what you get but with these earbuds you get so much more now of course you'll also get touch controls on the side on the right side you can control your audio so you can play pause uh go back a track that kind of stuff answer calls call siri whatever it may be you can call your voice assistant with it as well on the left side is where you get your ambient controls uh so you can turn on active noise canceling ambient sound whatever it is you have access to those controls over here and you can go within the app and customize uh which side does what as well and just like with the larger headphones where you can place your palm on one of the ear cups with these you can leave your finger on like the left earbud and you get a feature called quick attention so that it can you can have a conversation with someone if you don't have like that speech to tap that speak to chat feature on you also get some surprisingly not so standard stuff like being able to automatically pause your audio when you take these out of your ears i really don't know why all true wireless earbuds don't do that if you're a high entry wireless earbud you should be able to automatically pause your music as soon as you take them out of your ears that's just my opinion and what's also nice is that even if you don't put these in the case right away after using them if you keep them out of the case for a while they'll automatically shut off so you don't have to worry about battery life dying even when these aren't in your ears or in the case now a cool feature that sony has with these is the easy pairing with android so now if you have an android device and you just bought these all you have to do is basically open up the case have it near your device it'll automatically detect it and ask to pair so that's kind of like that airpods experience that we're used to but now with you know an updated android phone you'll have access to that feature as well but yes there are a ton of features that you can check out for yourselves if you're interested i just wanted to let you guys know some of the best ones and some of the you know craziest things that this thing can do but sony's done it again they brought all the features over from their big flagship headphones down to the earbuds and they did it really really well now how do these sound i personally think they sound good of course it's sony it sounds great you guys what did you expect i feel like these have a lot of life to them if you're looking for a bit of bass please have it you can go into the app and add even more bass if you want uh but it sounds really nice and like punchy without it being overdone that is like the balance you always want where you were able to you know hear the thump in your music a bit without having your vocals suffer honestly these are probably going to be my go-to earbuds i feel like i just changed them jay from the beats the b studio buds and now i'm changing it to these because these are that good uh so i enjoy listening to these they're great for watching like regular content as well so he did a really good job with the audio here i honestly have no complaints um the only thing that might be a tough pill to swallow is the fact that these are on the expensive side these are 279.99 which is at the true upper end for truly wireless earbuds at least the most mainstream ones so you are paying a premium but you are getting a very premium product but what do you guys think i know a lot of people are very happy with the wh 1000x mark force sony's flagship headphones but the earbuds are definitely worth giving a shot if you want something a bit more low-key but you still want access to all of those cool features and good sound quality but that about wraps up for this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy girl that gives this video a thumbs up and uh let me know in the comments do you think these are worth the 279 bucks i think so but i'm curious about your thoughts till next video guys it's your average consumer peace carl you need to upgrade can i go huh huh i can't hear you no canceling is too good
sony xm4 earbuds, so it's been almost two years since sony released the excellent wf-1000x m3 earbuds which had the best noise cancellation and sound quality of any true wireless earbuds at that time but a lot has happened since at the top end we've seen products like the airpods pro and bose's quiet comfort earbuds and you can get a perfectly fine set of noise canceling earbuds for cheaper than ever before but now sony's back and let me tell you it was worth the wait the new wf-1000xm4 earbuds we've still got these terrible names cost 279 dollars which is a lot of money but if you're willing to part with it you'll get the most impressive noise cancellation i've ever heard in earbuds like these even better sound quality longer battery life i know this time they finally got water and sweat resistance [Music] so the new ear buds are 10 percent smaller than the 1000x m3s and they come in the usual sony colors of black with rose gold accents or a light gray option instead but the case is where the real downsizing has happened it's 40 smaller than before and you can feel that difference when it's inside your pocket there's only one led on the outside now though which means there are no lights on the earbuds themselves to tell you how their charges but i guess that's the trade-off for a more compact design but i actually want to start off with the ear tips this isn't something we often focus on but sony's come up with these stellar tips that feel like a mix of silicone and foam that sealed into my ears just perfectly i guess that's why they're called the noise isolation ear tips sony is so confident in them that these new tips are now all you get and only in three sizes i'd have liked to have seen more fit options for this much money but the large pair were right on for me the thousand xm4s never so much as budged even when i took them on runs or for a hike outside and since they're now rated ipx4 for water and sweat resistance you can work out while you wear them or wear them in the rain and be confident that they'll survive just be careful to keep the case dry [Music] those snug ear tips combined with sony's new v1 processor lead to the best noise cancellation i've ever experienced with true wireless earbuds so far step aside bows i'm not exaggerating when i say that it's now almost as good as sony's over ear 1000xm4 headphones and those have the advantage of literally covering your entire ears working outside my local coffee shop on a busy brooklyn street everything around me just went poof and the clatter of subway cars was quieter with these in my ears than with the airpods or bose's earbuds becca took the sony's on a flight and they passed plane tests with flying colors it's wildly good stuff and a real technical achievement on sony's part there's an ambient sound mode you can activate with the tap of the left earbud to hear what's happening around you and sony still has its old trick where you can hold down on the earbuds to temporarily lower the volume of your music and boost ambient sound at the same time the thousand xm4s also get the speak to chat feature of the latest sony headphones when this setting is turned on the earbuds automatically pause and activate transparency mode if they detect you speaking if you talk to yourself even semi-regularly you should probably just leave this off now let's talk sound quality [Music] sony tells me that it tunes its earbuds and headphones based on what genres of music are popular at the time and so while the thousand xm4 is sounding mostly similar to the thousand xm3s there's this added layer of richer bass than there was before you still get that superb sound signature that's just plain better than the airpods pro and i prefer sony's tuning to other high-end earbuds like the sennheiser momentum true wireless 2s it's easy just to get lost in your tunes with these earbuds for the first time on its earbuds sony's also now supporting ldac so you can stream lossless audio from amazon music hd and soon spotify and apple music and it'll come through at a higher quality on the buds it's not quite cd quality you see ldac tops out around 900 kilobits per second and gets a little unstable if you set it at that maximum quality so i usually stick with the middle setting is there any real difference though maybe i'm buying into snake oil but to me these lossless tracks do feel like they've got more depth and clarity to them either way you can only get ldac on android and 1000xm4 still sound just as good when you listen to aac files on an iphone and then there's the battery life which is one of the more impressive things sony's pulled off the thousand xm4 buds get eight hours of playback with noise cancelling on which crushes apple and bows and jabra on amazon samsung and well pretty much everybody else they all hover around five hours and sony just tacked on three more that's progress battery life extends to 12 hours if you don't need noise cancelling on the case has enough juice for two full recharges so we're talking 24 hours in noise cancelling mode and 36 hours if you leave it disabled as we all start traveling again more often these numbers really set sony apart and help justify that 279 dollar price and the carrying case charges both wirelessly and over usbc as for voice calls the thousand xm4s use both beamforming mics and bone conduction sensors that sony claims help the earbuds know when you're speaking and when you're not to hear how that comes across in practice let's turn it over to becca rolling rolling rolling did someone say mike test first up we had the galaxy buds pro they were 200 when they were released and they were known for their windshield technology so you could have clear calls even in windy conditions okay next up is the airpods pro they have been the gold standard for a very long time when it comes to mic quality and quite frankly i'm getting tired of saying that line okay now we have sony's wh 1000 xm4s which i agree with chris is a horrible name but they have bone conduction sensors and beamforming mics how do they sound okay and this one's a bit of a wild card buds these are the soundcore liberty air 2 pros i really dig these headphones and they're only 130 dollars they have really good active noise cancellation so just wanted to throw them into the mix run the sink you all love this test i don't know why i was more fan of the wind test than we did for the galaxy events pro but think test is backed by popular demand the sync test runs the sync while i'm using the mics so that you can see how they sound with a lot of background noise is it canceling it out is it bringing it in see the thing about the water test is that i feel like i'm wasting loads of water and i usually collect it and water my plants with it but i don't need to water any of my plants right now so and that was some background noise did these 130 dollar buds hold up to the other bummer while you could hear me with these sonys it all just seemed kind of muffled and with the sink running it did take out that sound but i wouldn't say they have great mic quality overall you might blame me on the fact that they don't have a stem like the aeropod pros or the soundcore liberty r2 pros but the galaxy buds pro also don't have stems and they have pretty good mics i guess better luck next time so as you just heard these are not flawless earbuds and there are a few other frustrations you should be aware of first they can only pair to one device at a time and look i don't understand how it's 2021 and only jabra has figured out how to support multi-point bluetooth on earbuds sony knows how to make this happen on its headphones but you don't get the same convenience here at 280 dollars that's a hard thing to see sony leave out so i have hit some bugs with my review unit so far the earbuds have crashed a couple times playing the kind of sound you hear when a video game freezes and sometimes only one earbud will pair to my phone at a time so i've got to drop them both back into the case to get everything sorted out again neither is she's been that frequent then sony usually does a pretty good job of fixing these early bugs with firmer updates here's my takeaway sony's wf-1000xm4 earbuds are the best noise canceling set you can get today by combining its latest hardware with those fantastic ear tips sony has beaten bows for the noise cancellation crown and these are up there with the very best sounding true wireless earbuds you can buy they can outlast the competition in battery life and now come with reassuring water and sweat resistance there's no need to spend this much money for a good set of noise cancelling earbuds but if you do you'll get a top-notch experience in exchange sony is back at the top of the mountain the only question now is for how long scary spooky scary you should find a subway great dude over there oh my god i couldn't watch
sony xm4 earbuds, [Music] hey guys so is the Sony wfos xm4 still worth buying in 2023. it used to be that I wholeheartedly recommend this product but now I've got mixed feelings about it and in this video I'm gonna break it down into three reasons why you shouldn't buy it and three reasons why you should buy it right now since I've been using it for almost two years and I've covered pretty much all of its firmware Updates this is kind of like a long-term review of this product so I hope that this video will bring you value for your time I've split this video into chapters to make it easier to navigate and if you want to see more earbuds and Tech related videos from this channel get subscribed and tap the Bell button to stay notified okay first let's talk about why you shouldn't buy the Sony WF thousand xm4 reason number one call Quality in less noisy conditions it actually is quite decent in terms of voice pickup like when I was testing it in a public place in this video link in the description but in much noisier conditions you get a lot of noise leakage into the vocals which makes it sound terrible to the person on the call with you if it's call Quality you're looking for I recommend that you go for the Sony link belts as instead it does a much better job at cleaning up that noise in the vocals reason number two metallic pinging sound when chewing I suspect that it's gonna do with the bone conduction sensor because even the link buds s has this hollow picking sound now some people might find this issue annoying but to be honest it's not really annoying enough for me to be a deal breaker in my previous video about this issue again Link in the description there are also many people in the comments who don't think that this metallic pinging sound is a problem at all to be honest I just included it on this list because some people actually returned the Thousand xm4 because of this number three the battery life glitch now I want to emphasize that this seems to only affect the older units so if you were to get fresh stock in 2023 it's quite unlikely that you'll encounter this issue basically what happens to older units including mine is this glitch that under reports the actual remaining battery life causing the units to only last about an hour or even less than that it seems to be an issue that software updates can't fix so the units do have to be replaced by Sony and I'm glad that Sony's customer service seems to be pretty solid as an many people have gotten their units replaced with no issues now even when their units are out of warranty as was mine so this one here is actually a replacement unit now if you're looking to buy one in 2023 I suggest that you do avoid buying them used or refurbished try to get the fresh stock as much as possible because these don't seem to have this issue anymore if you want to learn more about this issue I've created a whole series about this with of course the links in the description now let's talk about why you should buy the wfos xm4 this year despite everything I've said above number one it's active noise canceling even after a few years these are still one of the most powerful noise cancellers in the market while being small and compact granted there are others that right now are more powerful noise cancellers like the Bose qc2 earbuds the dvla Gemini but those also tend to be bigger or more expensive or both so the wftxm4 strikes a good balance on size while not compromising on ANC performance number two it's gonna snug fit that doesn't fall out maybe even more snug because of the foam tips and if you watched some of my previous videos I keep emphasizing time and again that fit alone can make or break through wireless earbuds if it's meant to be noise isolating it has to be snug and stay snug otherwise the sound quality is affected as well as its noise canceling this one never falls out ever of course you'll have to try different sizes of ear tips to find the right fit for your ears and the foam tips do have to be replaced once in a while due to hygiene reasons but if it's a snug solid fit that you're after this is great and number three of why you should buy it if you're looking to get some great sounding earbuds the xm4's sound quality is still among the best right now it does support high-res wireless streaming over ldac so if you've got an expensive dap this one's very suitable for that it also has tight bass without sounding over bloated clean and Rich mids and Airy highs and it's also possible to further fine tune it in the Sony headphones collect app of course this may not be to everyone's liking I want to emphasize that its sound quality is not for everyone some people may feel it's got too much bass others may feel that it's too bright in the midst but for me it strikes the right balance and sounds great for various types of music that I listen to namely Lo-Fi hip-hop synthwave classical instrumental and Game soundtrack Tracks Of course RMB once in a while so those are three reasons to get and not to get the wrxm4 in 2023 after weighing the pros and cons and considering that this is an older model I would not go for these unless it's on promo especially now that we've got the Sony link bus s yes it doesn't have wireless charging it is total battery isn't as great as the xm4s but it's very close to the xm4s in terms of performance and sound and it's much more tiny has better call Quality much better in fact and a lot more affordable than the xm4 it does use silicone tips instead of foam so it's got less noise blocking in the mid-range than the xm4s but you can also get foam tips to go with them again if you're interested I've got the links in the description below and just a while ago there was a firmware update that added multi-point pairing to the link belts s which makes the link belts as even better value for money right now well the xm4 might also be getting multi-point pairing but that update according to Sony was supposed to happen in the winter and then spring is almost here to be honest I'm not sure if Sony is still making it happen at all but just in case the xm4 does get multi-point pairing in a future firmware update I will come back to you with another video about it so do subscribe and tap the Bell button to stay notified about that update thanks for watching smash like and share it helps a lot I'm also on this quad so if you have this quad come and join the chat link is in the description click here to find out which are the best earbuds I've tested in the past year I've also made a video about my dream desk setup of 2023 so if you're interested in that kind of content watch this video over here
sony xm4 earbuds, Sony wf-1000xm4 have one major flaw at least for me however Sony has completely fixed the issue with the wf-1000xm5 and I'm actually really excited to talk about this because the xm5 have completely transformed my experience with Sony's Flagship earbuds now if you follow the channel then you know the biggest issue that I have with the wf-1000xm4 is their size they're large very bulky and for me trying to get the proper fit is borderline laughable and the only reason I still own them is for comparison purposes like this video right here aside from that they literally sit on the Shelf the 1000xm5 have a much more compact design including the case if you notice it's a tad Slimmer in comparison which means it's going to take up less room in your pocket and just like the case of the xm4 it does support wireless charging now when it comes to the earbuds the size difference is much more noticeable if you ask me they look a good 35 to 40 percent smaller which means in terms of fit the xm5 are going to work for a much larger audience including myself they also have a glossy finish which some people were concerned would make them look cheap but honestly I don't mind it and I actually think the Finish provides a little more grip in the ear compared to the matte finish on the xm4 they're still using the foam style ear tips which I kind of have mixed feelings about on one hand it definitely helps in terms of the noise cancellation and then on the other hand they're harder to clean especially if you go with the lighter color option and after extended use they start to deteriorate and break down and for whatever reason Sony doesn't make it clear-cut where or how to obtain Replacements now there are third-party ear tips that are compatible but for the best performance especially in terms of noise cancellation Sony's original foam tips are the way to go so it would be nice to see Sony make those available for purchase same as before the xm5 have touch sensitive controls and they're giving us something that we've wanted for a very long time and that is access to all of our controls at once so to control the volume you simply tap either earbud a total of four times so now once you go into the app all you have to do is decide which earbud you want to control your Ambient sound and which earbud you want to control your playback it's nice to see Sony finally get on board with this especially since so many other earbuds have allowed this for quite a while unfortunately with the xm4 you still have to pick and choose between Ambient sound playback controls and volume control now let's go ahead and talk about the fit so right here you can clearly see the difference between the two and I'm happy to say that even if you have smaller ears much like myself the 1000xm5 are definitely a viable option that's never really been the case with the xm4 I've been using the xm5 for the past few days and it's been so refreshing to just take them out of the case pop them in my ear and not have to worry about them falling out a minute or two later instead I can go on about my day do what I need to do and the earbuds stay put now would they be my go-to for hitting the gym probably not but for anything outside of that whether it's taking a walk taking a trip catching a flight a train ride anything along those lines these are going to be an excellent option for me personally there is still the option of automatic play and pause whenever you remove one of the earbuds from your ear and you still have Sony speak to chat feature that enables the ambient mode anytime you start speaking as far as battery life the numbers on the xm5 are the same as the xm4 with up to eight hours on a single charge and a total of 24 hours once you factor in the case they also have the same ipx4 rating which makes them safe from sweat and light splashes of water now as far as the connection we know that the xm4 recently received a firmware update that brought multi-point with the xm5 they come with that feature right out the gate so you can easily connect the earbuds with two devices at the same time and you are able to use multiple point along with Sony's high-res ldat codec simultaneously speaking of ldac let's go ahead and jump into sound quality so the xm5 are using updated drivers and they're giving you typical Sony level sound everything is very well controlled you're getting some excellent presence in terms of the mid-range the higher frequencies are nicely balanced to give you that sense of clarity the base is very tight and Sony has always had this clear base option inside the app that allows you to really dial up the base but it does so in a way that doesn't come off bloated or muddy and all these things together they just give you some flat out quality audio recently Sony introduced a feature inside the app that develops a custom EQ profile just for you and I actually really like this feature so basically you can play any song that you want and it lets you choose from a series of different EQ tweaks and based on your choices it will customize the sound so if you're someone that doesn't want to go through the custom EQ process yourself this is a quick and easy way to enhance the sound quality this feature is now available on the xm4 as well so if you already own the xm4 I definitely recommend checking it out altogether I wouldn't really say that the xm5 sound drastically different from the xm4 like I said it's Sony's typical sound signature which is great but for me the fact that I'm getting a much better fit a better seal and Better Sound isolation I think that enhances the sound more than anything and that also carries over into the noise cancellation Sony definitely has some of the best noise canceling Tech on the planet but I could never really get the full effect because of the fit on the xm4 with the xm5 that's no longer an issue so these without question have some of the best noise cancellation that you can get in a pair of earbuds it's up there with the airpods Pro 2 as well as the Bose quiet Comfort to and I do have a comparison video on the way comparing all three so definitely make sure you subscribe and stay tuned for that not really any big differences as far as the ambient mode you still have the adjustable slider in the app that allows you to get very detailed as far as how much of your surroundings you want to hear moving things over to call Quality the xm4 have been criticized for their microphone performance and I do feel like the xm5 have improved slightly but I'll let you guys be the judge alright so right here we have an indoor microphone [Music] wf-1000x85 I do have some noise being played on the speaker to simulate a somewhat noisy environment testing testing one two three testing testing one two three all right so right here we have the Sony wf-1000x8 indoor microphone set we do have the background noise being played on a speaker testing testing one two three testing and testing one two three so right here we have Sony wf-1000x75 as you can see outdoor environment got some traffic taking place behind me so this should give you an idea as to how you would sound in a relatively noisy environment so right here we have the Sony w 1000xm4 same outdoor environment traffic taking place in the background so this should give you a comparison between the xm5 and the xm4 to see if the microphones are any better so really quick let's talk about a couple of new features that the xm5 bring to the table one of which is spatial audio apparently there are select Android devices that have a new spatial audio feature that's compatible with the xm5 unfortunately I haven't quite figured out what devices those are and so far it doesn't look like my s23 ultra has this feature there's also a new feature that allows you to answer or reject phone calls by nodding or shaking your head so you literally don't even have to touch anything I can see this being useful if both of your hands are occupied and you happen to be getting a call now this isn't completely new tech by any means there was actually a pair of my boy earbuds that I reviewed probably about two years ago I think they were called the mob void gesture and they actually had this exact feature as well but it's still cool to see Sony incorporated into the xm5 so that's my take on the wf-1000xm5 compared to the xm4 long story short night and day difference simply due to their size I will have the links to both of the earbuds down in the description if you're interested aside from that appreciate you guys for watching as always and I'll see you in the next one oh [Music] [Music]
sony xm4 earbuds, outside of airpods I wouldn't be surprised if Sony are the biggest name in earbuds right now and their latest model has just arrived they're calling their new WF 1000x M5 the best noise canceling headphones which is a pretty bold claim given how strong the competition is I know I've tested the vast majority of them myself and ranked them all based on their performance Sony used to consistently rank at the top in earbuds lists they've even held that noise canceling title in the past but have since let that slip their wf-1000x M3 set the Benchmark for what earbuds could be not just offering excellent sound but great all-round performance the mark IVs then improved on the design and added convenient features like wireless charging and multi-point they too were often considered the best around but that reputation Sony were riding on for so long has started to wear thin as great as the earbuds still are the industry has moved on very quickly the truth is that others of caught up and overtaken them in many areas in fact the markforce didn't make it into this year's earbuds awards at all and they've seriously dropped down the rankings so the new m5s are a chance for Sony to regain their reputation and move back up to the top spot with a significant performance boost but is that what we get here well we're going to look at everything that's changed from The Mark IVs but crucially how these actually compare against the rest of the market [Music] I want to firstly address Sony's commitment to sustainability just look at this simple 100 paper materials packaging Sony has been Leading The Way with this for a while now and deserve credit the earbuds are constructed with recycled packaging too and we get a redesign with this year's model the charging case firstly is now smaller it's substantially thinner and therefore fits more easily into your pocket they've sacrificed the LED light bar for a simple dot which is a shame but thankfully they've added back in a physical pairing button this makes a huge difference should you ever need to re-initiate pairing mode or crucially to reset the earbuds so I'm really glad that's back the earbuds are redesigned with a slightly different ergonomic shape and now have a mostly glossy finish as opposed to matte Sony describes this as a more luxurious feel but I have to disagree the glossy texture feels cheaper it's kind of slippery and I find the matte textures grip a lot better in your ears so that's a change I'm not a fan of what is good though is that these are 25 smaller and shave 20 off the weight too a common criticism that the mark IVs was the relatively bulky size so I'm sure this is a welcome change there's now a super small size option with the included ear tips as well so these are generally going to be much more suitable for those with smaller ears but on the flip side those with bigger ears may actually struggle with these the fit is of course subjective and whilst for some this will be a big Improvement I personally find this new shape and size doesn't fit as securely as before I have to really adjust these in my ears to finally get a Tight Seal but once I eventually do these sit comfortably and are definitely not as bulky as the previous model unfortunately I did have to swap Sony's ear tips for my Sonic foam tips instead because even their largest tips are no good for me and simply don't create a tight acoustic seal this is a problem I suspect Others May encounter as well I also had this issue with the mark IVs but it is worse now because of this new earbud shape and I think a lot of it is down to the foam just not being very pliable Sonic foam tips have a wider size range and are much more of a memory foam material that you can easily shrink down to go in your ears and then expand to create that tight and secure seal if you guys don't know what I'm talking about this is the company that sponsored my best earbuds under 100 video I'll leave that linked Down Below in case you missed it but essentially they make foam tips that fit basically all earbuds and I specifically wanted to give them another mention here because I think they could be the perfect alternative if you're also having trouble with your new Sony Mark 5S as well if that's the case then all of the details on these will be linked in the video description certainly without some alternative ear tips I wouldn't trust these to stay put for workouts I did manage to run with these but I needed to reach up and adjust them a few times and the older Mark IVs do fit my ears a bit better I do enjoy the improved Comfort though that's definitely better now that these are lighter though the mark fives aren't quite as Tiny and comfy as Sony's link buds s and I'll come back to how the two compare later because I think Sony has made a big problem for themselves the touch controls return are as responsive as ever and once again offer Auto pause with wearing detection the excellent quick attention feature with a tap and hold and you can get hands-free voice activated Google assistant or Alexa control most earbuds don't offer that or at least require you to tap the earbuds first one really important Improvement I noticed here is that you can use either earbud on its own no matter which Voice assistance you're using with the mark 4S if you're using Google and you put the right side earbud back into the case you can't keep listening on the left the mark 5 has created this problem so you can freely use either side on its own oh and the audio immediately switches to Mono playback if you're using just one just as before you don't get complete freedom to remap each touch gesture you have to select a bulk group of controls for each side however you now don't need to replace a whole bunch of controls just to add in volume control Sony have added a new gesture to the mark fives where you can simply repeatedly tap on the left for volume down and the right for volume up it actually works really well they've timed the increments well so you don't constantly overdo it and I love finally having volume control without having to replace something else the handy or rather hands-free speaker chat feature returns although this time it did seem a little bit sensitive it was triggering even with a simple cough and that's after lowering the sensitivity in the app so I hope Sony can tweak this with an update to perform more like the mark IVs one change they've made is getting rid of the voice prompts when switching the ANC mode you have tones instead like on the link buds but you can now set the volume for the essential voice guidance that you can't turn off which is nice devils are brought over the quick access feature for Spotify tap or endol from the link Birds there's a new service added here as well called autoplay which detects your activities for example putting on the earbuds or starting to walk and it will give you notifications or start audio playback based on these you can customize how this works and this feature is still in beta and currently only links with either Spotify or endol but I'll be interested to see what this can develop into in the future spec wise we have a pretty similar list to the previous Mark IVs a list including an 8 Hour battery or 12 if you turn off ANC which is very good wireless charging and an ipx4 water resistance rating I must admit I did really want at least an ipx7 rating for full submersion just to ensure greater peace of mind for durability connectivity gets a slight boost with the latest Bluetooth 5.3 version which means we also get Le support later this year and the new lc3 codec the mark 4's codex return including of course Sony's high res ldac there's both Google Fast pair and Swift pair for easy pairing to Android and Windows and there's also multi-point for two devices thanks to Technics just two device multi-point is something we actually have to specify now moving on to ANC Sony's adaptive sound control returns for intelligent automatic switching based on your actions if you prefer manual control you can either use the app or the earbuds themselves to change the ANC mode you can see for ambient or transparency mode we get 20 different levels so you can adjust how much of your surroundings the earbuds filter in that's brilliant and once again the ambient mode is super clear and works very well unfortunately there's no slider or adjustment for the active noise cancellation and in fact the separate toggle for wind noise reduction is now gone so it's all just automatic and not customizable which simplifies things for a casual user but come on it's really the tech savvy people buying these who probably want more control but let me address that video title what has happened to Sony because this ultimately relates to the ANC performance the markifiers have a new dual processor set up to improve both sound quality and the ANC and to my ears there is a subtle Improvement in noise reduction over the mark IVs the mid to high frequencies especially are canceled much better things like crowd and traffic noise I find the passive noise isolation isn't as good though because of the smaller size there's less of a Tight Seal in the air so the performance will of course vary depending on how well these fit your ears too I can't help but notice though how the ANC performance just isn't on the level of some of the rivals now Sony used to be right up there with the best but after falling behind they've sadly not managed to catch up much with this new model so ANC is no longer a major strength of these earbuds in fact for me even their link buds s cancel out more noise which is very strange I thoroughly exhausted my testing of this just to be fully sure even pressing in the earbuds to guarantee a perfect seal but even then the amount of noise blocked out and canceled still only Lan Sony a surprising 25th place for ANC so far now that doesn't mean it's bad I'm not trying to shame Sony it just means there are quite a few better Rivals and that's important for a pair of earbuds claiming to be the best that cost 300 and that are from a company that used to lead in this category all right so let's talk about the mic Quincy and I'll start with the Thousand X M4 so that you can hear the difference but it's quite windy today and there's also some loud background noise such as passing traffic if you watch my full review on these you'll know that I said the mic quality was only average of best with these and then switching over to the new Mark fives hopefully you can hear just how much more isolated my voice is these use three mics per earbuds and new processors and AI algorithms combined to deliver much more effective noise canceling performance in fact these even make it into my top three for earbuds for the mic quality category even overtaking the link buds s Sony calls this their best cool quality ever and yeah it really is there are two new core quality features I want to mention as well the first of which is head gestures so with your hands are full but you still need to answer a call you can now nudge your head to answer or shake your head to reject it now actually this feature works pretty well but I'm personally going to leave this feature turned off just so I don't accidentally pick up on someone ignore them and the second feature is capture my voice you've seen this in other earbuds before and it's where the earbuds allowed to hear your own voice during the call but I personally didn't really hear any difference at all the only thing I did do was allow a little bit more background noise in for me so I couldn't hear the cooler as well but my cooler could also hear more of that background noise so it's not a feature I'm going to use but if you do want to hear your own voice you could always just switch to Ambient sound mode during the call anyway so it's not really that big of a deal moving on to sound quality I think this aspect is only beaten by the call Quality and is once again fantastic two things I think Sony earbuds do as good as anyone else are the Sound Stage and instrument separation even the stereo separation is better than most other Rivals and it creates this wonderfully open and spacious quality to your music you get detailed treble without ever Crossing that boundary into producing harsh and sibilant sounds vocals are clear and distinctive but the overall sound signature remains really well balanced the best yet from Sony they've managed to shake their association with being base heavy the base here is more natural with ultra low Distortion even when you crank up the volume so the tuning is now closer to an audiophile's flatter frequency response as opposed to the bass boosted consumer-friendly approach that most earbuds take the mark fives are claiming sickly my sound quality rankings so far a very impressive feat albeit one that doesn't quite overtake our earbuds Awards entrance I guess the downside to the sound is that there's less sub bass that sort of booming bass that you can feel which I know is quite popular I sometimes boost the clean bass slider up in order to hear more of that in the types of tracks I typically listen to there's a whole bunch of great presets here in the app and a five band EQ if you want to personalize the tuning so there's arguably a little less immersion now especially when Outdoors but this aspect is also going to be controlled by how well these fit your ears so I think this describes the key change in the sound profile from The Mark IVs the new model has less of a rich warm and Bassy sound but instead offers more clarity detail and a more balanced tuning it perhaps goes against what you might expect given the new larger drivers but that just shows it doesn't always guarantee deeper Bass personally I really like the change and think this has improved but audio is subjective and others may prefer the Mark 4 style instead not everything about the sound is perfect though and I want to point out one really annoying issue actually and that's the massive EQ shift when you turn off ANC or Ambient sound mode I often like to use this off mode to save on battery but the bass just completely disappears and the clarity weirdly drops as well it's such a noticeable difference that I can't believe more people aren't talking about this I'm running the latest software as of this video 2.0.1 so come on Sony please fix this bug ASAP I really do expect better from earbuds this expensive alright so the new Mark 5S come with a price tag of 300 an increase of twenty dollars over the mark 4S so if we felt we needed to justify the criticism of the earbuds drawbacks then there's your answer these are one of the most expensive pairs of earbuds you can buy but to look at the positives these really are a fantastic all-round pair of earbuds they have a great feature set they sound fantastic they're really good for phone calls and that part is a huge step up from The Mark IVs as well the new shape and smaller size will fit some people a lot better and little quality of life improvements in the added volume control gesture and fixing the single earbud use issue could make these a more compelling proposition than the previous model here's how the two compare side by side I think the price tag remains a significant barrier to purchase though and the relative drop in ANC performance compared to the rivals really is surprising again I'm not sure what's happened to Sony here I can't help but feel disappointed by that and I really wanted them to challenge Bose for ANC or at the very least to perform a lot better I think that's fair to ask for 300 earbuds the big problem Sony faced though is their link buds s most of what I love about the new Mark 5S I already love about the link buds s you will saw the earbuds Awards video and know just how good these are alright there's a couple of features missing there and the sound quality isn't quite on that same high level but the considerably lower price means you're getting much better value for money and I still think that the better choice for most people let me know what you think about these earbuds though or if you plan on buying these I especially want to know how well these fit you because I think that's going to be hit or miss if you found this video helpful then please let me know by giving this a like make sure you subscribe and hit the notification Bell as well so

Galaxy Buds2 Pro," It's been six months since I bought 
a pair of the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2   Pro. While I don't think they're the buds 
everyone should get, I'm going to take you   through who I think these buds are for and I'll 
answer some of your questions along the way. Now, the first thing I like about these buds 
are their sound quality overall. Considering   you can now get these buds for $120 
to $170 depending on the retailer,   and I've left purchase links in the description 
so you can check whatever their current price is,   considering that they sound very good, especially 
when paired with a Samsung Galaxy device. That's   because Samsung uses a proprietary codec called 
SSC, which stands for Samsung Scalable Codec,   for encoding and decoding 24-bit audio compared to 
the normal 16-bit audio used by other codecs. And   that tech, paired with the drivers found 
in these buds, gets you a really nice,   well-balanced sound that at times can be 
punchy with a really nice wide soundstage. Now, I got a ton of questions on how these 
buds sound compared to the brand new Sony   WF-1000XM5s. I still prefer the XM5s over 
the Buds 2 Pro because of their better bass   fit and substantially better battery life, at 
eight hours of ANC playback versus the five   hours you get with the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. 
When you compare the Sony's to these buds,   the Sony's help identify two shortcomings 
with the Buds 2 Pro sound quality: mainly,   they lack a bit in dynamic 
range compared to the Sony's,   and their bass is also a bit lacking. But 
that's likely due to their ear tip design. Let me explain: With both the Sony 
WF-1000XM5s as well as the LinkBuds S,   which I've also reviewed, Sony uses ear 
tips that go further into your ear canal,   creating a better seal, which often 
nets you better bass performance. Overall, I'd put the noise cancellation 
of the Buds 2 Pro on par with buds like   the LinkBuds S or the Pixel Buds Pro. It's 
good, but not best-in-class. Which is a shame,   because I really like the drivers Samsung 
put in these buds. If they just had a bit   better sound isolation, I think they'd 
be one of the best buds on the market. Now, thankfully, you can somewhat adjust the 
EQ of these buds. But the EQ feature that   Samsung implemented for them was not what 
I was expecting. Samsung only gives you a   few select options. The dynamic one was the 
closest to the adjustments I wanted to make,   but it was still a bit too bass-heavy. I don't 
know why Samsung just doesn't let you have a   full EQ like the buds from Sony as well as 
the Pixel Buds Pro, which I've also reviewed. Now, related to audio, is another feature 
that Samsung marketed with these buds,   and they marketed quite heavily, and that's 
called 360 Audio, which can make it sound like   speakers are all around you. And it uses head 
tracking technology to make it sound like the   sound coming from your phone is actually coming 
from where your phone is physically located. To me, this feature, like it 
is on a lot of Apple products,   is mainly a gimmick for earbuds. The 
only scenario where I've ever found   this feature actually worthwhile and useful 
is when using it with my AirPods Max and   my Apple TV 4K when watching content. 
Because in that scenario, the AirPods   Max are actually able to reproduce a surround 
sound environment, and it's quite convincing. For these buds, would I buy them over another 
brand just for the 360 Audio? No. You could   still get buds like the Pixel Buds Pro or 
the new Sony Buds and still benefit from   Dolby Music through services like Apple 
Music. Though with earbuds in particular,   I haven't really found much of a benefit 
using Dolby Atmos music. Where Dolby Atmos   really makes a difference with music listening, 
in my experience, that has been with headphones   like the AirPods Max and with speakers, 
specifically the Sonos Ray, a speaker design   signed from the ground up specifically for Atmos 
and spatial audio. And I have a long-term review   coming out very soon on it, so make sure you're 
subscribed to the channel if you want to see that. But in general, with these buds, Atmos sounds 
fine. However, if you enable 360 Audio and   then enable Dolby Atmos on a service like Apple 
Music, it actually sounds horrible. I'm assuming   it has to be a bug, but with both settings on, 
songs sound echoey and reverberating. It's like   someone took your phone, started playing music on 
its speaker, and then chucked it into the world's   largest bathroom. Samsung markets the 360 Audio 
feature as being compatible with Dolby Atmos, so   I'm not exactly sure how this got so screwed up. 
If you've run into that or know what the hell is   going on, definitely let me know in the comments.
Now, the next thing to look at with these buds is   their mic quality. Here's how they sound 
compared to some of their competition:  These are the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, this is how their 
mics sound. And these are the Pixel Buds Pro,   this is how their mics sound. And these are the 
Bose QC IIs, this is how their mics sound. And   these are the Sony WF-1000XM5s. And these 
again are the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, these are   how their mics sound. Let me know down in the 
comments which one you thought sounded better   when experiencing the transparency mode on these 
buds, which I have enabled right now. Overall,   I actually think it sounds pretty decent. I 
can hear my environment very well when I use   transparency mode, and when I'm listening to my 
voice, it sounds clear. The only knock I'd give   the transparency mode is that when I hear 
my voice, it still sounds a bit artificial.   It's almost like someone turned the gain up a 
little bit too high on the mics used on the buds,   and it just doesn't sound like I'm not 
wearing buds. Which, to be fair to Samsung,   is pretty typical in buds in this price range.
Another great thing about these buds is their   design and case. Overall, I found them 
to be a pretty comfortable set of buds,   though not as comfortable as the LinkBuds 
S. For flights, they've been pretty good.   I used them on a short-haul flight, and the noise 
cancellation was pretty good. I haven't used them   on a long-haul flight yet, but I don't actually 
think their battery life would really last the   entire flight. Their battery life is only rated 
for five hours, which is on the low end when   you look at buds, even buds in this price range. 
The Pixel Buds Pro have much better battery life.  While they're comfortable, because the buds 
are still kind of wide towards the ear tips,   I could see how it could still make somebody's 
ears a bit sore. Also, while I haven't had a   problem with them on walks or hikes, for going 
on a run or going to the gym, you might want a   bud design with a stabilizer arc, like those made 
by Beats, Bose, and Google, for a more secure fit.  These buds are water resistant. They can 
actually be submerged up to 30 minutes with   their water resistance rating, which is 
better compared to the higher-priced Sony   WF-1000XM5s. Those only have an IP4X rating, 
which means they're just splash resistant.  Another thing I've come to like about these 
buds is their case. It's pretty slim, can   hold 18 hours of battery, and I love the grippy 
material Samsung used in the design. Plus, it has   wireless charging, as the tech gods intended.
And because these buds are made by Samsung,   you do get some Samsung-specific features 
with them. Like Samsung SmartThings Find,   which will show you the location and even give 
you an audible alarm when you walk away from them   so you don't actually leave them somewhere you 
don't want to. They have other features like one   that can sharpen the sound for phone calls when 
you're in a noisy environment, auto-switching   between Samsung devices, and a gaming mode 
for minimizing audio delay. They also have   a conversation recognition feature that'll lower 
the volume when you're talking to someone, which   is pretty nice. But if you sing along to music, 
you will likely want to keep that feature off.  For playback controls, they're pretty 
straightforward. You just tap once to   play and pause, twice to skip forward, three 
times to skip back, and tap and hold the left   button to cycle through transparency mode and 
noise cancellation. They have an experimental   feature that you can get to within the bud 
settings that does allow you to raise and   lower the volume using the edge of the earbud.
So, now let's talk recommendations. Do I recommend   the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro? Yes. Though I don't think 
they're the buds for everyone, mainly those who   do not have a Samsung phone. If you don't have 
a Samsung phone, I'd personally shop around a   bit and I'd probably only end up on these buds if 
they were on a really good sale. I'd spend more   for the Sony WF-1000XM5s if you want better 
battery life, noise cancellation, and sound. If you're an Android user, and especially a 
Samsung user, and you want a pair of wireless   earbuds with great sound, decent battery 
life, in an ergonomic design, and that   has decent noise cancellation, I think these are 
definitely a buy. I've left purchase links in the   description so you can check their current price 
or the price of the other buds that I mentioned. If you like this video and found it helpful,

Galaxy Buds2 Pro, all right the galaxy buds 2 pro wow these earbuds there's so much to talk about these there's a lot of great features on here great fit way better than in my opinion the galaxy buds 2 and better than the galaxy buds pro and for a while we didn't know if these were going to be the sequel to the buds 2 or the buds pro and with the name of the buds 2 pro it was still a little confusing right but after actually using them it doesn't matter which one they're the sequel to i would say they're probably the sequel to the pro but either way they're substantially better than either one of those there's so many cool features on here fantastic sound quality great active noise cancellation great microphones and a lot more we're going to talk about in this video not everything's perfect we're going to talk about the cons as well but i want to start off with my favorite category with a pair of earbuds like these and this is going to be the features and the controls something that samsung always excels with so much so getting into the features that these have there's really a massive array of features but starting off we can easily switch between galaxy devices like the galaxy watch or more recently a tv as well and so this is really useful if you're obviously in the samsung ecosystem so for example using a samsung phone i'm gonna go for a run leave my phone at home i can instantly switch over to my galaxy watch additionally we have voice detect on here another feature we've seen previously from samsung when you're playing music you can just start talking if somebody walks over to your desk it'll turn your music down pause it turn on ambient and you can talk to whoever you're talking to and then when you're done talking after like 10 seconds the music will resume you can control if single double triple tap is enabled and this is kind of new to enable each individual one so if you say you know what i hate single tap let's just do double and triple you can enable those and for tap and hold then not only can you enable or disable that you can also choose exactly what that does from volume controls which i don't use and i'll show you why in a second or you could do like spotify or or assistant or something like that and speaking of assistance we have bixby wake up on here if you're into that of course there's an equalizer the ability to read your notifications just in general or read by specific apps that you enable we've got ambient sound that works during calls if you want it which i personally use i like talking on the phone and hearing myself talk so i'm not yelling and also so it's not like a weird environment for me but you can turn this off if you want to not hear yourself talk when you're on the phone we have in-ear detection for calls again meaning that if you're on a phone call and you take the earbuds out it'll switch over to speakerphone very easy to do that and not have to answer a call and say oh it's connected to my earbuds i don't know where my earbuds are and then you're like trying to switch you know on your phone next we have a really interesting and new one this is not one i've seen on any pair of earbuds in the past and it's using the accelerometers on the earbuds to actually determine when your neck is looking down too much so if you're looking at your phone for more than 10 minutes you'll get an alert a little notification on your phone that you should look up and stretch your neck and it's supposed to be good for your posture in general it's something that i've actually already experienced you don't realize how long you're looking down at your phone but even just doing my sound quality test which i've been using these for a while but when i was making this video i was just going through songs and trying to figure out what was good and what was not good about these earbuds and i was looking down the whole time and then after it seemed like a minute it was actually 10 minutes it notified me that i was looking down for too long we also have uh in samsung labs in there you can actually go into gaming mode and what i was saying about the the controls earlier the reason i don't use the touch and hold for volume is because you can double tap the earbud edge to control the volume a great feature that i really love to see on samsung earbuds it's been around for a couple years now i'm not sure why it's still in samsung labs i think it's a great feature and i really wish they would kind of just streamline that in with the rest the controls but regardless great feature to have and of course if you lose the earbuds you can do more than just have them chirp with samsung smartthings find you can go in there and see where they were last connected to your phone and things like that these earbuds are definitely impressive but we need to compare them to the best on the market so if you want go on down and leave a comment and let me know what you want me to compare these two i think my next video is probably going to be comparing these to the pixel buds pro leave a comment let me know you think about that and while you're down there definitely click that subscribe button so you don't miss that video so like i said a massive set of features and honestly even more when you dig into accessibility but now let's talk about another very impressive aspect of these earbuds being the sound quality so the sound quality in these overall is really good in my opinion with a fantastic balance warm and powerful bass and then sub bass being rumbly and clearly very capable around 30 to 40 hertz you're really getting a lot of punch out of that and then the bass drums are clean and powerful you're getting a natural full sound with with like i said great balance and a fun signature that presents vocals well also while delivering detailed highs and a clean strong beat in the lows instrument separation and low level detail are definitely good on these not quite industry leading like they're not quite sennheiser and banging a luftsan level but they're still better than a lot of previous samsung earbuds which is the same they're a very close second they're really really good as far as sound quality goes i would say that these have a good weight and a pretty good head stage as well but as i was alluding to with the low level detail they could use like a tad more depth and that would put them at the number one like best sounding earbuds that's really the only thing holding them back as far as getting into actual songs i've listened to slow ready by goose on their newer album has great dynamics and pleasant vocals and then if you listen to downhill by drake this is a great example of the balance where there are a lot of different very very different frequencies that on other earbuds might eclipse each other and that did not happen with these earbuds listening to the snaps earlier on this song they're not sibilant as they might be with a lot of other earbuds and the whole song really comes together like i said without eclipsing any other frequency bands okay so that's a lot about what these earbuds do but i didn't actually talk that much about the case or the design in general so the case of these earbuds is really familiar as you guys might recognize this kind of square design on the front personally i'm a big fan of that i like it when you can open up the earbuds they can sit open on a desk like that wireless charging on the bottom type c on the back really a great case design and why change something that already works well the case inside has two you know obviously the two little earbuds one kind of tiny gripe with this is that they look like they would go in like vertical but they kind of rotate a lot more than you think the earbuds almost go in like sideways and so this means that when you put it in like it usually slides over where it should be but i've had a couple instances where i put them in and they didn't quite settle down where they were supposed to but once you get used to it absolutely no complaints with the case design the earbuds themselves look really similar to the previous generation specifically the galaxy buds pro however these are 15 smaller than the pros when you're wearing them you can absolutely tell that there are three different colors there's a purple which i have right here we've got the black and of course a white one as well i actually really like all these a lot because they are matte and one of my biggest complaints about the pros besides like you know anything functional just from the aesthetic point was the mirror finish i really didn't like how the pros looked and so having a matte finish like this looks great just a subtle earbud that is very compact very small and you can leave a comment let me know how you think these look personally i'm a big fan of the aesthetics here but they also have ipx7 water resistant so if you're working out they fit really well we'll talk more about fit in a second but the water resistance means that sweating or dropping them in a puddle or whatever anything that happens with water these are probably going to be okay the case unfortunately does kind of get scuffed a little bit easily it's not really that bad because from every kind of small damage i've done to it so far you can kind of rub it off and and it comes back to looking normal but it does scuff a little bit easy something to be aware of like i said with fit and comfort they are very secure which again i didn't expect this i always loved the wingtips on the galaxy buds plus and the regular galaxy buds as well and samsung moving away from that was always a little disappointing the buds live never fit in my ears very well the buds too would fall out all the time specifically of my left ear and the buds pro stayed in reasonably well but still weren't really that great for me and they were kind of hit or miss a lot of people really didn't like them and so again no wing tip so take this with a grain of salt everybody has different ear geometry but for me personally these stay in substantially better than i thought i went for a four mile run the other day like a pretty fast run at that and it was really hot out and the earbuds i never once had to even adjust them they stayed in perfectly the entire time incredibly light my ears didn't feel stuffy i was just really happy with the fit and the comfort of these earbuds diving into the active noise cancellation they're calling this intelligent anc on here and basically when you're using it what is it actually like so i would say it's definitely very clean so you don't have a lot of white noise or hissing or anything like that and it's actually substantially more powerful than i expected so you're able to block out a lot of sounds around you very very capable of blocking low frequencies very well and keep in mind this only comes with silicone ear tips so if you swap these out for some foam tips i'm sure you could block out higher frequencies as well and really have a very impressive pair there now let's actually get into a microphone test all right so i'm outside right now by a pretty busy road it's also really breezy and there's a box truck right there so tons of sound leave a comment and let me know how these are performing and now for reference this is what they sound like indoors in a much quieter environment so getting into some of the pros with these earbuds like i said the active noise cancellation is actually really really good the sound quality is really good the fit and comfort is really good i love the design the aesthetics they check a lot of boxes and on top of that they're coming with a future proof bluetooth 5.3 and then additionally without active noise cancellation you can get up to 29 hours of battery when you're including the case but not everything is good with these like i said we can get scuffed on these a little bit uh the transparency mode is decent enough and i'd give this like a maybe like a b minus rating but i can still hear everything around me but it doesn't sound like very natural sounds a little bit muffled additionally although these have great sound and they have samsung's scalable codec if you're using samsung phones you're getting 24 bit audio if you're not using samsung phones there's no higher level codecs you're limited to just sbc and aac they don't have aptx so if you don't have a samsung phone you're kind of out of luck with this in addition to that if you have an iphone you can technically connect these but you're not going to be able to get any of the settings we showed you in this video because there is no available app for iphones again samsung just trying to play apple's game there unfortunately although you get a great battery life when anc is off if you turn on active noise cancellation which let's be honest you're probably going to do this you only get five hours in the earbuds and 18 hours with the case and then my biggest complaint with these is although they're able to switch between samsung devices what if you don't have a samsung device right like what if you're using a windows laptop and you're using a galaxy phone or even a macbook and a galaxy phone in that situation there is no multi-point connection that's a big problem for me because i do use a macbook and i want to use samsung devices and switching between them would just be so nice and it's something other earbuds already do samsung needs to add that feature so in conclusion here before i was really unsure if these were going to be a sequel to the galaxy buds pro or the galaxy buds 2. and as it turns out they're kind of a sequel to both they're better than the pros they're better than twos and these in my opinion are easily the best earbuds samsung ever made the matte finish the cool new features the improved sound quality make these a clear upgrade over the previous generations of samsung earbuds while simultaneously checking almost all the boxes for earbuds in my opinion from top notch water resistance to bluetooth 5.3 solid microphones the only really downsides here are the battery and the lack of multi-point connectivity and honestly i would say these probably have a really good chance at being the best overall earbuds of 2022. too early to tell but leave a comment let me know what you think about the galaxy buns 2 pro i personally really enjoy these if you enjoyed the video consider liking and subscribing i'm mike o'brien thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music] you
Galaxy Buds2 Pro, hi there i've got samsung's 230 galaxy buds 2 pro here which i keep referring to as the galaxy buds pro 2 because that's what i think the second generation of the galaxy buds pro should be called but hey i don't get to name products i just review them and i will say that these buds have an all-around better design than their predecessor which just didn't fit my ears all that well with the ear tips that were included not only are they 15 smaller but they weigh slightly less 5.5 grams per bud versus 6.3 grams and have a soft to the touch matte finish on both the buzz in case that gives them a nicer feel and makes them a bit more grippy and that finish also makes the compact case a little less likely to slip out of your hand and more importantly it helps keep the buds in your ears a little more securely and thanks to their new shape and smaller size i was able to get a tight seal with the largest set of included ear tips and didn't have to supply my own i can't say they'll fit all ears equally well but they should provide a better fit to more ears than the original galaxy buds pro [Music] aside from the revamped design samsung is touting the bud's improved noise cancelling and support for 24-bit high-resolution audio the catch is that to get that 24-bit audio you need a galaxy device equipped with samsung's one ui 4.0 and a music streaming service like qoba's title or amazon music that streams high-res audio tracks on all other devices including android phones and iphones the buds default to the aac audio codec they use bluetooth 5.3 alas they don't support the more common aptx adaptive audio codec for android devices only the new samsung seamless hifi codec which samsung says delivers 256 times more sound data than 16-bit cd quality audio numbers like that are a bit deceptive because based on my experience you're really only going to notice a small difference when streaming higher bitrate tracks but more on that after i ran out the rest of the feature set these have touch controls they work well but don't offer much in the way of customization and galaxy device owners can activate hands-free bixby samsung's voice assistant samsung's 360 audio virtual surround feature with head tracking returns in an enhanced version and now works with a variety of galaxy devices out of the gate though it's not compatible with other android devices it works along the same lines as apple's spatial audio feature for airpods and can enhance your movie and tv watching experience though it doesn't seem to be as pronounced as apple spatial audio which i think is slightly better overall it also works with music or any audio you're listening to the buds 2 pro are ipx7 water resistant which means they can withstand being fully submerged in one meter deep water for up to 30 minutes i had no problem running with them and they didn't slip out of my ears like their predecessor battery life is rated at five hours with noise cancelling on and eight hours with it off at moderate volume levels and you get about three additional charges in the case which charges via usbc and wirelessly some people are complaining that five hours is pretty mediocre and yeah it is but it's hard to shrink buds while increasing battery life and there is a quick charge feature to get you an hour use when you drop the buzz in the case for five minutes or two hours with a 10 minute charge so those battery life numbers weren't a deal breaker for me sensors detect when the buds are in your ears and will pause your music when you take both buds out of your ears but what's a little weird is they won't resume playback when you put them back in your ears without you tapping on one of the butts you can use a single bud while leaving the other one in the case additionally you can opt to activate a voice detect mode in the galaxy wearable companion app that automatically turns off noise canceling and switches to ambient mode when you speak allowing you to hear the outside world and engage in a conversation with someone sony offers a similar feature with this wf-1000x mark iv and link buds s earbuds another new feature worth mentioning has nothing to do with audio you can toggle on the next stretch reminder setting that detects your head position alerts you when you bend your head downward for 10 minutes that's a good one for all of us who stare down at our phones all the time while these have a find my buds feature that samsung calls smartthings fine it doesn't offer the more precise tracking capabilities of apple's enhanced find my in its latest airpods it just tells you the location where the bus last connected to your device you don't get true multi-point bluetooth pairing that allows you to pair the butt simultaneously with any two bluetooth enabled devices such as a phone and a computer but they do offer auto switching between samsung devices logged into your samsung account including samsung tvs built in 2022 or later and samsung's galaxy books laptops built after 2020. i haven't thoroughly tested the auto switching feature with many samsung devices because i just don't own that many samsung devices so i can't confirm exactly how reliably it works but feel free to let me know about any experiences you've had with it in the comments section samsung says it's improved the noise cancelling on the galaxy buds 2 pro by 40 percent it calls it intelligent anc now i have found it an improvement on the original galaxy but pro but noise cancelling performance is affected by how tight a seal you get from the ear tips so your perception of how much is improved may vary by how good a seal you get i thought the noise cancelling was close but not quite there with that of the noise cancelling the sony wf1000x mach 4 buds but it did a good job muffling a variety of noise on the streets of new york and in the subway you can turn the noise canceling off or activate ambient mode the equivalent of apple's transparency mode which i thought sounded pretty natural but there's no setting to adjust noise canceling levels it automatically adapts to your environment i appreciate that the buds 2 pro are equipped with two-way drivers a 10 millimeter woofer and 5.3 millimeter tweeter along with three microphones two of which are being forming for voice calls i paired the buds with a galaxy z flip 3 iphone 13 pro and google pixel 4 xl and stream music using quobas i also stream some movies from google play and netflix according to samsung there's no way to check whether you're getting 24 bit audio nothing indicates whether you are or you aren't but if your audio setup meets the list of requirements be using the samsung seamless hifi codec which transmits in 24 bit assuming your audio files support it i found it irritating there's no way to tell what bit rate you're streaming at but i'll have to take samsung's word that i was getting 24 bit audio i did notice a small difference when streaming tracks from quobas with the galaxy z flip 3 however using the iphone 13 pro the sound quality was also very good with an amply wide sound stage i went back and forth with different tracks and the flip 3 sound came across slightly more accurately the touch more detailed depth and clarity the base is punchy and well defined and i didn't experience any noticeable distortion at higher volumes in short they're excellent sounding buds but i'm not sure they're superior to other top earbuds in their price range including the pixelbuds pro beatsfit pro and sennheiser momentum true wireless 3 but their sound is a noticeable step up from the sound of the standard galaxy buds 2 particularly in terms of clarity i mostly went with the default sound setting though you can tweak the signature profile in the galaxy wearable app with some preset equalizer settings including a bass boost setting the truth is a lot of these premium priced earbuds are starting to sound pretty similar and it's really the fit and how they fit your particular ears that's going to make you like one more than another once again samsung has delivered a set of galaxy buttons that work well as a headset for making calls they have good voice pick up from the beam forming microphones while providing good background noise reduction callers so they could hear me relatively clearly in the noisy streets of new york and the buds did a decent job reducing wind noise they're in the upper echelon in terms of voice calling performance i'm in the streets of new york city here and i'm talking to john falcone a fellow editor how do i sound john there's a little bit of wind in the background here and some traffic is going by well if you're on a fairly noisy city street i'd have to rate the experience on my end as very good to excellent just hear a very slight kind of hiss that we sometimes get with noise cancelling but your voice is coming over loud and clear no artifacts or distractions and just a really good experience for the listener on my end all right i'll talk a little bit more now there as the traffic goes by you can see there's a lot of traffic a little bit of wind here big truck going by so hopefully you can hear me for better or worse galaxy butts have always been an accessory for galaxy smartphones and as a result more geared toward the owners of galaxy devices the galaxy buds 2 pro are no exception they're excellent earbuds but you do lose some of their key features if you're not a galaxy device owner for that reason it's easy to see them as the samsung equivalent of the airpods pro which may very well get some sort of high resolution wireless streaming option with the arrival of the airpods pro 2 that will likely use proprietary apple technology that only works with its devices by comparison the pixel buds pro have fewer features geared exclusively toward pixel owners and such features as hands-free google assistant and true multi-point bluetooth pairing are available across all android devices however the pixelbuds pro have no enhanced audio codec support which may be important if you're convinced it makes a big difference i personally think it only makes a slight difference with this class of earbuds which may have a premium price tag but aren't really high end the bigger question will be whether it's worth upgrading to the galaxy buzz 2 pro if you already own a pair of galaxy buds particularly the original galaxy buds pro i think that will largely depend on what price you can get the galaxy butts 2 pro for while their list price is 230 samsung is currently offering trade-in deals of any galaxy buzz in any condition that bring their price down to around 155 and you can often get deals on them as part of a bundle with a new galaxy phone for me anyway while the galaxy buzz 2 pro offers some legitimate performance improvements over their predecessor their design is the biggest upgrade that makes them the best galaxy buds yet but let me know what you guys think if you're a current galaxy buds pro owner are you going to upgrade to the buds 2 pro and would you still consider getting them even if you're not a samsung device owner sound off in the comment section if you're interested in any of the products mentioned check out the description below for links on where to find them and you can get

Galaxy Buds2 Pro, hello gorgeous peeps I'm Chris from Tex burn and today we're going to be reviewing these gorgeous sweet purple Beauties right here the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro a 219 quid these true wireless earbuds are even more expensive than the already pretty bloody pricey 179 pounds Google pixel buds while offering a lot of the same features including ENC assistant integration yada yada but you've also got 24-bit audio support with certain Samsung blowers you've got Bluetooth 5.3 support bit of Bixby action if that's a good thing I've had the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 pro stuffed to my skull for the last few days using them as my full-time true wireless earbuds so here's my in-depth review I'm also going to do a bit side by side with the rescue Google pixel buds Pro to see which one might be best for you and for more on the latest and greatest Tech please do POG subscribe ending that notifications Bell cheers now you've got a small selection of colors when it comes to the Galaxy buds 2 Pro you can grab them in white or black pretty standard stuff otherwise also this lovely Bora purple effort and frankly they look the nuns tits and just like having soft smooth colorful wee Pebbles lodged in your locals but in a good way I really love that Sleek matte finish no gloss inside so they don't get all greasy as you handle them always a bonus they certainly have a very premium Vibe about them which is just as well as you're spunking up over 200 quid for the buggers my only complaint on the design would be that obvious seam between the front and the back sections although you don't even see that when they are stuffed in your head the buds have a kind of winged section this topic that juts out so when you put them in you just stick them in with a Twist and that little bit kind of embeds itself underneath your ear flap and just helps to keep them very firmly in place I found there's absolutely no shifting around whatsoever even if you're pegging it down the pavement doing a bit of a rubber size and whatever the hell you want to do and just to prove the point launch test and I found that the Galaxy buds 2 Pro were pretty comfortable to wear for a good few hours I didn't feel any buildup of pressure or anything just started to get the usual ear fatigue after around three to four hours at which point yeah definitely good idea to pop them out again so that's pretty similar to what I experienced with the Google pixel buds Pro as well but as far as water resistant goes these are definitely the winners because they're full on ipx7 water resistant whereas the pixel buds are on the ipx4 splash resistant both are fine for you know working out down the gym sweating all over them rocking in a rainstorm all that kind of stuff but these things can actually be submerged in water as well and still survive so if I had to choose between pixel and Samsung based on the design I'd probably go for these because they're slightly more Compact and you've got that water resistance otherwise there's very little between them now when it comes to actually hooking up to your handset where you've got the latest freshest Bluetooth 5.3 support here on the Galaxy buds 2 Pro and the range is absolutely insane slightly better than what I found on the pixel buds Pro I found I could leave my smartphone in the garden and then come into the house Wonder up a flight stairs and it still will be absolutely perfect no cutting out or anything and if you are a Samsung fan well these Galaxy buds 2 Pro will connect seamlessly to pretty much any Sami gear out there certainly any of the latest stuff including a couple of the most recent 2022 televisions and if you've got yourself a Samsung Galaxy watch you can rather helpfully toggle the ANC mode and you can also at any given moment deactivate those touch controls or switch them back on again and also get an accurate readout of your Galaxy buds 2 Pro battery life and owners of Samsung smartphones will also enjoy improved audio quality here on the buds 2 Pro but more on all that in a bit now you do have some control of your Galaxy buds 2 Pro if you dive on into the Bluetooth menu as you can see there on your Samsung smartphone you can again toggle the ANC toggle the touch controls on and off to a few other little bits and pieces but if you don't have a Samsung smartphone or you want deeper customization you'll have to download that Galaxy wearable app this gives you access to all of the other features including voice detect 360 degree audio and you can actually customize those touch controls in here by default as you can see there is just the single tap that is active as well as the touch and hold but you can get a bit of double tap and triple tap action on the go these could only be used for skipping tracks however whereas if you're going to touch and hold for instance you can see exactly what you want each Bud to do when you do long press them again toggle for the ANC you can call a good old Bixby War great mates otherwise you can tweak the volume or bring up Spotify I thought those touch controls Works in absolute charm usually first time I've asking you do exactly what you want to do you've got full tonal feedbacks you know when it has screwed up and even the double Taps and the triple Taps did the job in that wearable app you can also turn on the voice detect feature which is thankfully Switched Off by default this does do what it says on the tin basically when the buds detect that you are talking it will immediately lower the volume of whatever you're listening to and put you into the noise awareness mode so everything that's going on around you is filtered in so the idea is somebody comes up to you starts talking you say oh hello there or whatever and immediately the volume goes down the noise awareness turns on so you can have a conversation without removing the buds and then once it detects you've stopped talking after a few seconds it will then raise the volume back up and put it back into ANC mode or whatever you were in before because this feature ain't much good if you mumbled yourself all day long like I do you'll just find that you're constantly turning on the noise awareness and lowering the volume of your music which ain't great although thankfully it usually doesn't activate when you just blurt out a word of a couple of syllables like bollocks or toss pot or whatever so that's something unlike the pixel buds you'll find plenty of other great features packed in here like find my buds if you have to lose the buggers down the back of the sofa or something so lots of great little tools and stuff to play around with so when it comes to the touch controls and the other features I found again it was a pretty close call between the pixel Buds and the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro but if you are a Samsung phone You've Got Gear like the Samsung Galaxy watch and a Samsung smartphone then you're probably gonna get more out of these buds rather than the pixel efforts as for your assistant Shenanigans while here on the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro you've only got access to Bixby unfortunately Verizon is the Google assistant on the pixel button words fully voice activated as well as the ability to press and hold to call up that assistant if you're feeling a bit self-aware you can if you want to have Bixby announce any upcoming calendar events and also any text messages that pop through on your smartphone but that's it there's no support for any third-party apps unlike on the pixel buds Pro where the good old Google Assistant could read out any WhatsApp messages and other bits that land on your smartphone so I've got to say it certainly as far as the assistant Shenanigans is concerned I preferred the Google pixel buds helps that I prefer the Google Assistant to Bixby anyway now Samsung's fresh new buds do boast a triple mic setup for the active noise cancellation it's not adapter VNC uh just like the pixel buds does an absolutely fine job of dampening down traffic sounds and other background bollocks that's going on all around you not the absolute best out there not as good as the likes of the buzzers and the Sony's but does a pretty damn fine job means you can stroll down a busy bustling High Street and listen to a podcast or an audiobook without having to boost the volume all the way up and risk wrecking your hearing just don't expect them to completely drown every everything out and leave you in complete silence because that ain't gonna happen the good news is like the pixel Buzz there's no wind feedback or anything as well so overall it is a good experience so yeah between these and the pixel buds definitely a draw as far as the noise canceling goes but what about the audio quality well the sound has once again been fine-tuned by AKG here and it's mighty impressive stuff Samsung's updated seamless codec means you get full 24-bit audio here that sound is no longer down sampled to just 16 bit so it's great news for high-res audio fans but and it is a pretty big but if you want to enjoy that top quality 24-bit audio you will need a Samsung smartphone running the latest one UI four and I've got to say on the default settings I really enjoyed the audio that has been spaffed into my log Hall certainly the likes of metal Rock a bit of hip-hop as well all sounded great some nice respectable base from something so dinky but it didn't drown out the higher end output vocals really shine as well so great news for podcasting audiobook lovers especially and if you're enjoying a bit of video on YouTube the plus your Netflix or anything like that you've got full Dolby Atmos support here as well for that nice cinematic surround sound experience so overall while I also enjoyed the sound quality of the Google pixel buds the buds 2 Pro certainly win if again you've got a Samsung smartphone especially as the pixel buds they didn't support ldac or aptx HD or any of those top end codecs that you would expect from a pair of Premium true wireless earbuds I know it's time for a jolly spiff and old mic test and I'm recording this audio using the Galaxy buds 2 Pro built-in microphones just a nice quiet Studio environment here but I have found that they work really well when out and about as well even with a lot of background noise and just to prove that point I'm now recording this portion of the audio sample while still next to my speaker which is blurring out really loud traffic sounds and as you can hear the Galaxy buds 2 Pro microphone still clearly picking up my voice despite all of that background noise and last up the battery life in here on the Galaxy buds 2 Pro I found that the battery life reliably dropped just under 20 for every hour of use and that was with the ENC turned on so I got just over the quartered five hours of use with the noise cancellation and then when they are drained you can just bung them back and they're very cute and colorful little box which actually mirrors the color of the buds themselves this could fully recharge the buds just over two times in also giving you just under 20 hours of battery life from a full charge of the case and the buds saw not as strong as many rivals unfortunately a lot of them do tend to hit sort of 25 30 hours and unfortunately the pixel buds do win in this round as well because they tend to offer sort of six to seven hours of use with that ANC turned on but like the pixel Buzz the kiss is again incredibly dinky and smooth and curvy as well so very easy to slip into any pocket or bag going and for added convenience the actual cases themselves can be charged wirelessly if you have to have reverse wireless charging on your smartphone for instance otherwise you've got a good bit of type c USB port action you just slap in a wire job done and all right there's my full final Frank review of the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro and a bit of side-by-side action with the pixel buds just to see how they stack out up I gotta say I really really do like these true wireless earbuds but if you don't have all this Samsung Gear to go with it the likes of the Galaxy watch your Samsung smartphone of course to really enjoy the full range of features as well as that top quality audio well it's not worth that money instead I would say maybe go for the pixel buds Pro or maybe the Huawei buds something else a little bit more affordable instead anyway that's what I reckon what do you guys think definitely be great to your thoughts down in the comments below please do

Galaxy Buds2 Pro,
Galaxy Buds2 Pro, so we're getting into the busy part of the year google has dropped new phones new earbuds new software all bunch of toys we're getting ready for the iphone 14 at apple's fall event and yes samsung is just off its latest unpacked event i was actually there at the first one 200 years ago we've got the new z-fold 4 in the new z flip 4 and on the phone side of things they're definitely pretty exciting today we're going to look at these the samsung galaxy buds 2 pro there's a lot to like here there's a lot here i'm not quite so crazy about i'm phil nickinson this is digital trends do me a favor go do all the things like subscribe hit the bells all the video stuff you know you need to do right all right let's go so first the basics of the galaxy buds 2 pro there's just not a lot going on in the box here you get the buds the case and the usbc cable even though these charge just fine on a wireless charger which is how i prefer to do it so the buds 2 pro retail for 229 we're already seeing discounts from samsung itself and chances are you'll see them cheaper from other retailers too but on paper that makes them more expensive than the google pixel buds pro but less expensive than the apple airpods pro the butts 2 pro are about 15 smaller than last year's version samsung says they've got active noise cancellation built in they've got spatial audio stuff we'll talk about in a minute they have this newfangled 24-bit audio codec stuff we'll also talk about in a minute and they're available in any color you want so long as it's black white or this sort of lilac-y purple that i actually kind of like a lot so what do i like here well first they fit and they feel great they're super light they fit almost flush with your ear because they're so small so if i'm looking at you straight on there's a good chance you won't even tell i've got them in all in all i say the fit is about the same as the google pixel beds pro more that than airpods pro it's just a really light feel in the ear it doesn't make you feel like you're in a vacuum at all so that's really nice and while it's a light fit i haven't had any problem with them popping out especially while i'm at the gym on the elliptical doing all that stuff grunting making weird weight faces they've stayed in just fine and as an added bonus these purple colors look like you have a little purple easter egg candy thing in your ear but please don't do that the point is it's a really good fit okay samsung has nailed it there love it [Music] so the next most important thing how do they sound well when you're doing normal things like listening to music or podcasts or whatever they sound really good uh there's enough bass in here to be enjoyable but not too much that it overpowers the rest of the music the highs come through nicely without thinning out or getting muddy way up there all in all i think samsung has done a nice job of just a really good overall balanced sound now the usual caveats apply here right these are going to fit in my ears a little differently than yours a lot of it depends on the environmental noise are you listening in a gym are you listening at home are you in a car on a plane whatever that affects everything right and speaking of noise so yes these have active noise cancellation and c on board samsung's done a pretty good job there again you have to take the totality of the earbuds into account here so the way they fit in your ears and then the tuning of the anc itself and it's pretty good it doesn't quite go as heavy i think as apple does it's really more along the lines of the pixel buds pro which i liked a lot so it blocks out most of the external sound a little bit still gets through and i'm okay with that i don't want to look and sound and feel like i'm in a vacuum that's just not a comfortable thing for me so again that's a plus on samsung here they did a good job and because it's still a thing people do phone calls sound fine too you sound like you're on earbuds okay it's not great it's not awful it works well enough i've gotten a little bit of wind noise coming through on my end uh you know on the other side i think we're all just used to it by now right it works as advertised so where things start to fall apart for me here is with the spatial audio if you've never used it instead of sound just coming from the left or from the right they sort of tune things so it's coming from above and behind and beside in 360 degrees that's where the term comes from 360 audio samsung's is just not as good as what we've experienced particularly on apples right so first the quality of the sound itself music just thins way out it's not good it sounds overly processed because it is because that's what's going on right and samsung also has head tracking in here don't even bother turning it on it's not good so as you turn your head the music follows you it's always kind of coming right at the center of you depending on which way you're facing it's odd a lot of people don't like it at all just in general but samsung's version of it sort of puts these invisible lines up in the air as i'm turning i can see exactly when it's shifting from one earbud to the other that's not great apple's experience with that is so much more fluid doesn't mean i necessarily like it but it is better and really all that's kind of a pity because other than that these buds sound just fine and then there's the whole 24-bit audio thing this is a big spec that samsung is pushing it has its own codec that will actually take lower quality 16-bit audio and upscale it to 24-bit there are some caveats here right first you're gonna have to be using a samsung device it's a samsung specific codec so that's that second there's no like toggle to turn it on and off so unless you know you're a real audiophile and you're often switching between different earbuds and different devices you're not going to notice this at all does it affect the overall sound of these earbuds sure if that's what makes them sound as good as they do on a day-to-day basis awesome is it a reason to buy these absolutely not it's just a marketing line for me so samsung says you will get five hours of continuous playback with these earbuds uh with noise cancellation turned on pop them back in the case and it's got enough battery in there for another 18 hours again you'll have to charge it a couple times right i don't use mine that way at all i don't know about you let me know in the comments but you know five hours at a clip is a long time for earbuds now samsung has a companion app that works across android devices which is great you're not locked into just samsung that's important it's how you get to things like all the different settings and options update the firmware on the earbuds that's always important so good on samsung for doing that you will get a slightly easier pairing experience on a samsung device to me that's not a huge deal especially when you have the app available so one of the features you definitely want to check out is voice detect i like that a lot so that's one where when it hears you talking it will turn noise cancellation off turn transparency on lower the volume all that stuff so you can actually have a conversation with somebody that's kind of cool i like that uh one thing i do recommend there though is flip the setting to go back to normal anc mode flip that to five seconds instead of ten tens just a really long time now there's also some quick switching that lets you connect them to multiple devices at once and hop back and forth you're going to need a samsung account for that so if you're not kind of in the samsung ecosystem chances are that's not going to be a big plus for you there's also a little fit test section and other settings you'd probably expect to find in earbuds these days that's pretty normal fair and then there's my favorite neck stretching there's a neck stretching reminder in here because who doesn't stretch their neck enough every day i certainly don't i'm sure you don't either it's the only knack we got you got to take care of it the point is if it detects that you've had your head down like this for 10 minutes it's going to remind you to stretch your neck so stretch your neck there's also a find my feature that will help you locate your missing buds there are some accessibility features that's always great to see thanks to samsung for that and you have some preset eq options i tell you i've tried them all i didn't find that any of them really made the music sound any better in fact i think they made them worse so i've just left it on normal the whole time so it's a lot on some little earbuds here's the bottom line for me on the galaxy buds 2 pro they're pretty good uh everyday music podcasts all that stuff they sound really good actually i would order them on great the fit and the feel is excellent samsung nailed that i have no notes noise cancellation pretty good uh maybe not the best but it's good enough for me and it does it in the way that i like it so i don't feel like i'm in an anechoic chamber like i'm in a vacuum it's comfortable it works and it does the job the way it's supposed to spatial audio stuff 360 audio that's where it falls apart it's not good i'm not going to use it on these buds i'm never going to turn the head tracking back on it was just not a good experience and you know this is another one of those times where i think ecosystem comes into play apple's got air pods for its phones and tablets google has the new pixel buds pro for its line and samsung of course has its own earbuds and these aren't the only earbuds from samsung right they've been doing this a long time they've gotten pretty good at it and the point is you're going to get a fuller experience with these earbuds on a samsung phone that's by design and it's not surprising right so if you're in the samsung ecosystem i would absolutely look at these if you're on some other android phone i'd probably go pixel and if you're on ios these work just fine with an iphone but i'd probably go earpods so in a nutshell look you can do better than these you can also do a lot worse okay i don't hate them by any stretch of the imagination and if you're a card-carrying member of the samsung knights and i know you are i think you're going to be plenty happy with the galaxy buds 2 pro that's it for the galaxy buds 2 pro be sure to like the video subscribe to the channel you know all the stuff that's it we'll see you next time
Galaxy Buds2 Pro, hi everyone tao here all right so these are the galaxy buds 2 pro which are samsung's follow-up to the buds pro that they originally released in 2021. if i asked you which one of these look like the more expensive product which one would you pick like seriously which one looks like the more premium product i'm curious to see what you all think personally i think the originals look more expensive now i totally get that the flashier more in your face design might not appeal to everyone but you can't deny it made these stand out it's not that i think the buzz 2 pro looks bad or anything i'm all for a minimalistic design but they just look a little too plain to me especially for the 230 dollar price tag which is 30 dollars more than the originals by the way plus if you opt for the white ones like i have here it's hard to deny that they have a very apple like aesthetics to them anyways as someone who really enjoyed the original pros i was super curious to see what sort of improvements samsung could bring this time around one of the most common problems with the buzz pro was that they were uncomfortable and from my personal experience whenever i smiled or yawn they would slowly slide out of my ear and eventually fall out if you're someone who's more active sweat only made the problem worse the buzz 2 pro are a nice improvement in terms of comfort i mean they aren't as secure as earbuds with wingtips in them but the 50 reduction in size definitely helps them stay in my ears much better for the first few days i didn't realize that i was actually wearing them wrong normally with galaxy buzz you pop them in and then do a bit of a twist to lock them in place with the buzz 2 pro just make sure that the vent is facing upwards and then slide them right into ears that's it they sort of rely on the silicone tips to stay in place wearing these for an hour or two i found them to be perfectly comfortable but any longer and my ears start to get sore because they do sit pretty deep the buds live from 2020 the one with the bean shaped design are probably still my top pick for all the comfort when it comes to sound i remember when i first heard the original buzz pro i was blown away by them i wish i could say the new ones are flat out better but that hasn't been my experience the buzz 2 pro definitely sound better in some situations but i actually found myself preferring the sound of the originals in lots of scenarios too [Music] so for example i'm a bit of a hip-hop head especially when i'm working out and for that i think the buzz 2 pro are way better thanks to a little more emphasis on bass that extra bass just makes it so much more fun to listen to hard-hitting tracks i also love listening to music from artists like jojo tori kelly maxwell for their amazing vocals and for that type of music i actually prefer the more balanced tuning of the originals i just think it does a better job showcasing their voices if i had to rate them i'd give the originals a 9 and the new ones a 9.1 slight edge to the new pros because they have a slightly wider sound stage and i dig the added bass another thing to consider is that these sound best when paired with a galaxy phone because it uses a codec that's only available on samsung devices that's the only way you'll get the 24 bit audio that these are capable of these also offer 360 audio with head tracking but 360 content isn't quite mainstream enough yet for me to consider it a big selling point as usual samsung doesn't give you a true equalizer in the app like some other high-end earbuds but they do offer five presets that lets you tweak the sound profile slightly if you're pairing it with a galaxy phone you could also use the custom equalizer in the phone setting for a little more control the biggest improvement is probably the active noise cancellation while walking outside with these they do a much better job muffling cars and other street sounds it doesn't do much with high pitched tones but for earbuds i've been really impressed the ambient mode which pump sounds from your environment to help keep you aware of your surroundings also sounds a little more natural this time around those are two nice quality of life improvements that i really appreciate you can toggle through both these modes with touch controls on the earbuds using the widget on your phone or if you own a galaxy watch via the buzz controller app voice detect is one of the cooler pro features that separates these from other samsung earbuds basically when it detects your voice the earbuds will automatically turn on ambi mode and lower your music to make having conversations with others a little easier this is one of those convenience features that you'll absolutely love if you're constantly interacting with people throughout the day or you'll absolutely hate it if you like to sing along to your music because every time you do it kicks in and totally kills the mood thankfully if that's you you can turn it off one of the new additions to this year is the neck stretch reminders basically if you spend a lot of time working at your desk or looking at your phone it can cause strain in your back and neck the earbuds can actually detect your head position and notify you when you've been looking down for longer than 10 minutes encouraging you to do a neck stretch i gotta give props to samsung i'm big on ergonomics so this is a nice little feature that you might not appreciate now but will 10 years down the road also if you're getting a lot of these reminders throughout your day it might be a good idea to rethink your desk setup and work habits multi-point connection is one of those features i always look for when shopping for wireless earbuds it basically lets you connect to two devices like a phone or laptop at the exact same time and prioritize connections based on what's most important a call on your phone would get priority over a video on your laptop for example unfortunately the galaxy bus 2 pro doesn't support multi-point connection but instead samsung has their own version of it that only works with their devices called a seamless connection basically the bus 2 pro can switch automatically between a galaxy tablet phone laptop and smart watch depending on whatever you happen to be using at that moment the watch is very hit or miss but swapping between the tablet and phone has been pretty good for my testing basically the lack of multi-point makes these earbuds a little less convenient if you aren't living in samsung's ecosystem the touch controls are typical for samsung earbuds you can turn off certain controls if you don't use them or always trigger them by accident i personally have the single tab toggled off since it pauses my music every single time i go to readjust the earbuds in my ears pro tip if you're a first time galaxy buds owner in the labs menu be sure to turn on double tap earbud edge now you can just double tap the back of your ear like this to adjust volume the right side for volume up and the left side for volume down that's pretty cool no quick side point the ergonomics on the buds themselves is something i'd like samsung to address in their next model i know there's only so much you can do with them but there's nowhere to grab them with this completely round shape i end up dropping them a lot more than i'd like the stem design that apple has with their air pods isn't the most attractive thing but it just makes putting them on and taking them off so much easier okay so right now you're listening to the mice on the bus 2 pro while you check out the sound quality compared to the originals let's break down the battery life real quick you're looking at around 5 hours of playtime on the earbuds and another 13 hours in the case for a total of 18 hours if you turn off anc you can stretch that to eight hours on the earbuds and another 20 hours on the earbuds for a total of 28 hours say hi red okay she's sleeping right now but yeah that's identical to the buzz pro so if you're hoping for an improvement to the battery life sorry that's not the case here the bottom line is the busy pro aren't a massive jump but the dress the biggest issue a lot of people had with the originals the fit everything else including better noise cancellation a newer bluetooth version and a slight improvement to the sound probably isn't enough to justify an upgrade if you are fine with the fit of the older ones at the end of the day when it comes to wireless earbuds you really don't need to spend this much money to get a solid pair for daily use anymore i mean there's so many options for less money however if you're already using a samsung phone the bus 2 pro are likely the best pair of true wireless earbuds you can buy if you don't own a samsung phone at this price you could probably do better or at the very least wait for the price to drop as usual thank you so much for watching until the next one i'm out of here [Music] you
Sennheiser MTW3, hey everyone welcome to the channel my name is mike and in this video we're talking about a really exciting pair of earbuds or at least one that i've been waiting for for a really long time and this is the sequel to one of my all-time favorite pairs of earbuds which were the sennheiser momentum true wireless twos in this video we have the sennheiser momentum true wireless threes now before we get into the threes i want to talk very briefly about the twos for a while they were my favorite pair of earbuds because they had really the best sound in my opinion they ranked really high on the best premium earbuds video i made on the best earbuds to buy in 2020 2021 and now we finally have a sequel which is like i said long awaited because even though i really liked the momentum true wireless twos they had their drawbacks for one they used a kind of antiquated connection style where you couldn't use just one earbud you had to have both out of the case in order for them to work another thing is they didn't have wireless charging they didn't have some other features that a lot of earbuds had and so for those reasons they kind of felt antiquated but still had great sound and now with the momentum true wireless threes sennheiser came out with a pair of earbuds that is better in almost all regards making them a really strong candidate for my favorite pair of earbuds and they made them cheaper instead of the massive 300 price tag on the twos these are 250 which i know is still definitely expensive but we'll take any cut we can get on that price especially because over time they're likely to go on sale anyway all right and now if you're not convinced on the 250 price tag let's get into the sound now the sound is really going to be probably the main reason anybody's buying these earbuds in my opinion they're probably the best sounding earbuds on the market right now or at least bluetooth wireless earbuds on the market right now and i'm going to explain kind of why that is so sennheiser now has three different levels of earbuds they've got the cx the cx plus and then they've got these which definitely do sound better these have a clean analytical sound profile very detailed with honestly pretty amazing clarity when you're listening to more complex songs with a lot of instruments the depth into in the instrument separation of these in my opinion really makes you understand why sennheiser consistently ranks as one of the best sounding brands in wireless earbuds overall a really natural sound to these and listening these is pleasant and enjoyable regardless of the genre at least in my opinion and of course as always sennheiser has their unique sound signature and and for me personally it's always been my favorite among wireless earbuds as i said but of course everyone has their own preferences so if you love extremely bass heavy music these still do deliver if you turn on the bass the extra bass boost on the app but i will admit that some people who are looking for just like massive bass distortion like if that's what you want and you just go to the gym and you're listening to rap or edm these might not be like the best purchase for you but in my opinion these sound a lot more like what the artist would actually want the music to sound like and of course if you're listening to high fidelity audio files you can make great use of the aptx or aptx adaptive codecs on here especially if you're using like an android phone for example but they also have sbc and aac codecs that work well for iphones and smart tvs or whatever other devices that you might want to use but even if you're listening to something with a lower bitrate for example like spotify in my opinion these will still give you an amazing listening experience thanks to their natural balance and pretty responsive drivers so it makes the music sound really fun and lively while still giving you a lot of the high end details again great instrument separation but these do tend to have a slight de-emphasis on the treble frequencies you kind of have to listen hard for that so i do like to boost the the treble up by maybe a few decibels in the eq but like i said really an impressive pair of earbuds and as far as the sound goes these are really quite amazing now as far as the active noise cancellation goes you guys might remember when the sennheiser momentum true islands twos came out i said they had one of the best ancs in the industry now at the time the competition was a lot weaker and as these aged many other earbuds kind of passed these and became a lot stronger but the new momentum threes here actually are substantially better so i just did the classic test where i play some white noise on a speaker and i listen to at what level i can actually hear that it's an imperfect test but just for a relative idea of how strong the anc is on the old momentum true ls2s which when it came out i thought were among the best i was able to hear at about level 19 or level 20. and on these which have an adaptive anc i wasn't able to hear that same sound until about level 23 or 24 so substantially more powerful and also a really nice clean active noise cancellation but it is adaptive so you don't really have to change the level wherever you are it's going to kind of listen to what's around you and use basically less power if you're in a quieter environment the anti-wind mode is also really nice if you're outside a lot of the older models didn't have that so i really like having that but again the ansi does a pretty decent job the adjustable transparency mode is also really nice to have as well although the play with music and pause music feature was a little bit confusing but regardless it was nice that we did have transparency on here so with that being said let's get into what's different about these what the design the the sound everything that you need to know about these like i said there is a lot it's really better in every single regard but let's start off with just the basics right here the case itself doesn't really look that different and i'm going to point out that's actually one of the first subtle drawbacks here a lot of cases are smaller these days i don't really feel like it's a drawback for me uh being like a male i have larger pockets but i could see like some women might have smaller pockets and not want to carry this that's going to be a bit of a drawback but i love the aesthetic of this one they still have a nice premium fabric look all the way around the case and now they actually have a third color so i have a black one a white one and this is actually their gray one so it's kind of in between color personally i think all of them look really good the charging is now on the front and here's a big positive it now has wireless charging so you no longer have to plug this in and pick it up on your desk and it's so much nicer when i take it out of my pocket i get to my desk i just set it on the wireless charging pad and it feels like i'm never charging my earbuds and then opening up the case this is probably my favorite upgrade here the earbuds themselves are substantially smaller that was one of the big drawbacks of the original and the second generation sennheiser momentum true wireless earbuds they're just so massive but these not only are they physically smaller in just about every dimension but they also have more rounded edges so the overall aesthetic design gives you the illusion of being even smaller than they are so i think that that was a massive improvement there and plus although you don't have that shiny exterior that we're used to seeing i love how they kind of made it a little bit more subtle a little bit more modern looking so you know not everyone wants to have a shiny metal circle in their ear sometimes it's nice to have something really subtle like this and looking at it you'll notice that the exterior has a little bit of a little bit of a ring a little bit of a bump around that which is another really big benefit like i said the physical design of this really has been improved massively this now has a wingtip on there which is something that we haven't really seen in a lot of other earbuds since like the galaxy buds really a lot of them have getting been getting rid of that but it's something i love to have because holding them in your ear with just a silicone tip it works fine but if your ears are sweaty or if you just everybody has different shaped ears right having a wingtip is another fit in there another way to customize the fit so it stays in your ears even if you're working out even if your ears are sweaty now we do have four different silicone actual ear tips themselves and these have like a little foam piece on the inside so you will want to make sure you're cleaning these but it's kind of a nice way to get a solid seal in your ear so you get the best attenuation you also get great isolation so it's going to block a lot a lot of sound around you without even turning on the active noise cancellation of course we'll talk about the anc later but the physical design again lots and lots of positives these also have mono mode now so i can take out just one earbud at a time it doesn't matter the left or the right which is a great way to save battery or whatever you might be doing if you just want one maybe it's uncomfortable in your other ear great feature i love having that these do have of course auto play and auto pause when you put them in your ear or take them out the led is on the inside so no one else can see that but you can still see when it's pairing or whatever it might be doing the battery level for example and then really the last thing to mention on the physical design is that we still have the touch pads on the outside personally i think these are easier to touch now they're very very responsive and i haven't had any missed touches at all it's perfect right on the outside and of course they check a lot of the standard boxes as well with an ipx4 water resistance rating seven hours of battery in the earbuds 28 when you include the case and of course a 10 minute charge gives you one hour of listening but let's get into something a little bit more interesting the actual features that have been added to these earbuds if you get the sennheiser my sound app this actually has a lot of cool things in there it's been redesigned and so in here of course you have connections is the first thing but although these don't allow you to connect to multiple devices at the same time you can connect to them separately and then use the app to switch between them so it's not quite perfect you can't just seamlessly switch like you can with airpods or jabra earbuds but it's kind of a close-ish second on top of that the app also gives you this really cool thing called sound zones so sound zones it's kind of exactly what it sounds like you use the gps on your phone to detect where you are and change the sound settings accordingly so when you go to your office when you go to the gym when you're at home you're probably going to have different sound settings you want and you can automatically have those changed with your phone and the equalizer although it's a lot more intuitive now and they have the bass boost and the podcast mode as well you can actually instead just go and do the sound check which is going to kind of test you your hearing and your frequencies and let you know what the best eq is for you so you can really find a custom the custom sound for yourself of course going down we've got transparency and adaptive noise cancellation that i'm going to actually test out and talk about in just a second and really the last thing down here is customizing the touch control so i always really liked how sennheiser allows you to customize the touch controls really in depth so you can actually customize pretty much any one the single the double the the triple press or the press and hold to do one of many different many different functions including voice assistant change anc levels power it on and off play the previous track next track whatever it might be there's a lot of functionality there and again the touch controls were really responsive and did a great job these also have bluetooth 5.2 so like i said before that does allow you to use just one earbud at a time and so really a pretty good connection there and now let's get into a microphone test so this is what it sounds like if i were to be on a phone call with you using the sennheiser momentum true wireless threes i'm in a studio environment so this is going to sound probably as good as they can but of course the three microphones really the benefit of having more per earbud is that when you're outside it's windy and there's a louder noise around you more ambient noise they should be better at filtering out sound so let's go out there and actually test it out all right so this is a microphone test i'm outdoors i'm in a park right now there's a river right there that's flowing pretty loud um there's a bunch of traffic driving on a road right there so honestly it's hard for me to hear myself but we'll see how good these microphones actually block out the sound leave a comment and let me know what you think of these so are these my new favorite earbuds that i'm going to wear every day now i mean it's hard to say i've only been listening to these for about the past five days but as far as the sound quality goes i think without a doubt these are my favorite sounding earbuds at least right now and the active noise cancellation does a great job the new redesign was was really much needed so i think these have a really strong chance at being the best earbuds on the market for a more premium price tier but of course if you're looking for something a little bit cheaper i've made videos about all different price categories from a hundred dollars fifty dollars there's so many other earbuds out there and the good news is the cheaper earbuds are getting better and better so i'll link some of those videos down below if you guys are on a budget if you want these i'll have a link in the description as well and if you enjoyed the video consider liking and subscribing i'm mike o'brien thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music]
Sennheiser MTW3, hey everyone it's been just over a year since my momentum three review and since then I've used these earbuds a lot so today we're going to be going through all the nitty-gritty details The Good The Bad what I'd like to see improved for the momentum for and if they're still worth buying today because they have been updated a lot through firmware in the last year now keep in mind going off previous Sennheiser true Wireless releases they're releasing new bud every two years it's only been a year so we probably won't see a momentum before for another year but now let's get into it the reason I've used these earbuds so much is because these are my go-to training earbud and I usually train four days a week for two hours so do the math there that's a lot of hours of Total use I've also dropped the case and the earbuds countless times I'm a very clumsy person the earbuds have been covered in sweat and chalk and you can tell by looking at them they've got some marks on them they've been used quite a bit apart from that they're completely fine now usually I choose a training earbud mainly based off how well the blood steamer is but that's something a case for the momentums they do fit me quite well there's no way they're going to fall out but I do find myself having to readjust quite a bit throughout my sessions I use the second largest ear tip and the largest wing tip I do have pretty large ears so the wingtip doesn't really do too much for me it would be nice to see some larger wing tips on the next version getting a good seal with the ear tips is also a bit tricky but with practice I have found it a lot easier for me I just need to take the earbuds in and out a couple of times until I feel an even seal this is only a slight annoyance and honestly something I have gotten used to but most earbuds that I test don't really have this issue there are plenty of other earbuds out there that give me an easy seal and better security such as the airpods Pro 2 nothing E2 JBL live Pro 2 and there's plenty more and every earbud that I review I test thoroughly in the gym but I keep finding myself going back to the momentum three for their Dynamic sound quality they just can't be beaten when you want a nice full Dynamic Sound and I will talk about the sound a little bit later or you to skip to it there are timestamps down there for your ease but back to the fit I did mention I use these when training and that is mainly when weight training doing some static cardio or walking these are not a bud I would recommend when running since a lot of body-borne noise is created I hear my own breathing quite a lot as well as the footsteps I make on the ground they're quite loud and this takes away from the sound it mainly takes away from the bass and when running you probably want to use a transparency mode to hear your surroundings the issue there is that the microphones pick up a lot of wind noise and it's just kind of annoying running with transparency mode on so I wouldn't recommend these when running some of my go-to earbuds when running at the airpods Pro 2 airpods three because they don't have an ear tip JBL live Pro 2 are also quite good and the Sennheiser sport are also a decent one they're actually designed for sports and running in mind they don't sound as good as a momentum three they do come pretty close but they fix the body-borne noise issues that the momentum 3 have check out the video up here for a detailed comparison between the sport and the momentums now let's talk about the battery life and mainly how well the battery is held up in the last year and it's just the harsh truth that battery issues battery drain issues are quite common even with premium earbuds talking bows Sony Apple I've had issues with my airpods Pro 2. had to get a new case and I have seen some comments of people's issues with the momentum three luckily for me I've had no issues at all from day one the battery life was incredibly solid I did get over eight hours at 70 volume with noise canceling on in my test and here's what I got in my test at 70 volume today so you can see how it Compares and the total battery life with the case and the earbuds is 28 hours so I find it only really have to charge the earbuds every three to four weeks so still great battery life today but let me know in the comments your experience with sennheiser's earbuds one clear issue with the case though is still its size for today's standards it's just a bit too chunky the total battery life is great and for me personally the size doesn't really matter since I just leave it in my gym bag but the size of it definitely holds me back from chucking it in my pocket this is where I'll just go for my airpods Pro 2 instead but I still love the design of the case and I just chucked this thing in my bag throw that bag around usually I have like five other earbuds I'm testing at the time in there and a whole bunch of random things which really does test the durability of the case and how easily it gets scratched and you can see my case still looks great today the durability is very solid now let's talk about controls this is where the nitpicks start to come in because the controls work great you can control everything including volume up and down you can customize almost everything I say almost everything since you can only add volume control on the long hold on the left and right earbud also transparency and noise canceling are separate functions so you need to set either one to a different control rather than having it all on like the single tap for example I also find it pretty frustrating when turning transparency mode on because you don't get any beep feedback to know whether or not you've actually turned it on or off this is mainly an issue if music is playing because you can't hear the transparency mode but if you have music paused then of course you can easily hear the transparency mode turn on unless you're in a quiet environment and it's just a little strange because the noise canceling gives you a different beat feedback whether it's on or off so I don't know why it's not on the transparency mode another issue with the transparency mode is related to the any detection that the earbuds use to automatically pause and play your music so when you have transparency mode on and you take one or both earbuds out of your ear transparency mode will turn off so if you put the earbuds back in your ear transparency mode will stay turned off so you manually have to turn it back on again I honestly don't know why this happens because we're noise canceling on if you take your earbuds out noise canceling stays on put them back in your ears noise canceling is still on a small thing but it's pretty annoying there's also no mute button when you're on a phone call another small thing but we can start to see a few small things start to stack up and I feel like they can all easily be fixed because like I said Sennheiser have updated their earbuds quite a bit over the last year and that shows with connectivity so there have been two big updates the first one is the addition of multi-point connection so that came out about six months ago which allows you to connect two devices to the earbuds at the same time and in my testing it works really well all you need to do is just pause media on one device before you resume it on your other device and I've tested it on my iPhone 12 Pro Samsung Galaxy s10e and my MacBook Pro M1 the only issue with it is whenever I open it up in the app to change the settings the app just crashes and that's always happened but I don't really have to adjust the settings but if you want to on an iPhone it doesn't work for me now the second big update is the addition of high-res audio because these earbuds use aptx adaptive which is actually high-res audio capable now what does that mean well it's very similar to what you get with ldac high resolution audio codec and there was nothing too clear online to say whether ldac is better than aptx adaptive even though the total kilobits per second on ldac is almost double what you get on aptx adaptive but then it's not just about how big the number is but anyway all the earbuds that have El Zac are always tested to see how much better the quality improves normally it's a couple of percent if you don't use high quality streaming if you use high quality streaming you get another couple of percent above that now I don't have a phone compatible with appdx adaptive but CEO in the making did a video on the high-res audio update he kind of explained it similar to what I noticed with ldoc a very subtle Improvement a couple of percent in audio quality so I feel like it's pretty close not a massive feature but if you use an updex Adaptive phone it's there if you need now call Quality is usually a feature on a lot of earbuds that do get updated over time so what I'm going to do now is is compare my audio recording from my original review to the latest firmware of what it sounds like today it's not going to be exactly in the same setting but I'll try and get it as close as possible alright so here we are in the outside world with the Sennheiser momentum 3 through wireless earbuds alright so here we are with the Sennheiser momentum three two RC mods all right and here's the core quality of generation three so hopefully you can hear my voice well and all the noise around me is getting blocked out all right if you're enjoying the video as usual please Chuck a like down there because it does help the video out now we're going to talk about noise canceling this is where the niggles kind of continue and some of them drive me a little bit crazy at times first the noise canceling is great here's my overall noise canceling ranking with all the earbuds that I have tested you can see Sunny is in the top five it's not the best noise canceling out there but it is very very solid the only issue with it is how easily the microphones pick up wind noise when you do have noise canceling on to the point where sometimes I'll just go for a walk outside it doesn't even have to be very windy it's just like me walking slowly creates a bit of wind and the microphones pick it up and if it is a windy day I can be listening above 60 70 volume and the wind is still very audible there is a wind noise reduction mode in the app which you can turn on manually and this completely cuts out the microphones picking up the wind noise but do keep in mind this is going to reduce your noise canceling strength by just over half so if I'm outside sometimes I just fine turning noise canceling off completely is the best way to go because the transparency mode like I said before it also does the exact same thing it picks up wind incredibly easily and of course this is inevitable with any True Value that has noise canceling and a transparency mode but the momentum three are up there with the worst that I've tested and looking at the design of the earbuds and where the microphones are placed it kind of makes sense why this does happen because a microphone is kind of on the bottom corner of the earbud there that microphone is facing straight ahead of whatever way you're going to be walking so when the wind hits it's going straight into the microphones those mics are picking it all up incredibly easily so I'm really hoping Sennheiser sourced this out with their next release also the transparency mode itself needs some improvement it's not too bad it's pretty natural but there is a lot of white noise here when using the transparency mode in a more quiet environment and you can adjust the strength in the up but anything above 50 which is what it's on by default there's just way too much white noise even at the default setting a decent amount of white noise if you tone it down it reduces but then it's pretty hard to hear things to the point even with earbuds in I could have a conversation with someone but if it's a slightly noisy environment with a bit of noise going on around I find just taking the earbuds out is a bit easier we repair like the airpods Pro 2 I can happily wear those if I'm talking to someone now throughout the whole video you've probably noticed these buds have a lot of little flaws but despite all the flaws what keeps me coming back to these earbuds is their sound quality it isn't the most balanced the cleanest or most well refined tuning out there but it does have the most dynamic and versatile sound out of any earbud I've ever tested now what do I mean by Dynamic and versatile and the reason I explain it like this is because of the amount of Freedom you get to customize the sound to your liking whether you want a nice balanced and clean sound or an over-the-top bass boosted sound because without customizing the sound at all right out of the box they sound pretty decent it is a balanced tuning but with nice deep sub Bass nice crisp trouble and a smooth mid-range but to be honest if you're looking for a more balanced tuning you're better off going for a pair like the airpods Pro 2 or the nothing E2 but if you're like me you want a little extra thump in the low end but want to retain as much clarity as possible the momentum 3 are my number one bud and if you're also looking for a Bud where you can just push the base at times to some over-the-top bass boosted subwoofer levels the momentum 3 are also number one when it comes to this so if I'm in the mood just to really intricately listen to my music I think they sound the best with no EQ customization on most of the time when using the earbuds mainly when training of course I do a subtle bass boost in the sub bass and the mid bass and a little boost in the treble and I have this on most of the time and I find that this brings out a little bit of extra bass it keeps the crisp trouble it does dial down the mids ever so slightly which I don't mind but they just work with all kind of genres with that tuning on and then if I'm feeling really crazy I Chuck on the bass boost EQ along with this bass boost EQ and that's what I'm going to use if I'm going for like a really heavy lift and I'll just need to crank some hard Style some nice bass Heavy Music and the buzz has become a little bit over the top boomy and they're great for that and if I want to take it even further this is my ultimate base EQ where I bring the mids down heaps and it's really just bass and treble and this does sound pretty crazy but it's more of a fun thing to play around with and you can really push the bass to levels where most earbuds I've tested will start to distort sound pretty weird but the momentum still sound okay when you're pushing out this much bass now I also need to add what the recent firmware update has done to the sound quality I wasn't going to add this in the video I kind of played around with it and I didn't think it was that good I tried it again and it's pretty game changing so this is firmware 2.12.33 and this now gives you even more sound customization first is the extra bands in the EQ so now you get five bands compared to three so this gives you more freedom to play around with the mid bass and the upper mid-range but out of all the updates I've talked about here today that's not the massive change obviously it's going to be with the sound personalization so you just go in the up down to the my sound section then choose sound personalization and this feature can drastically change how the buds sound well past how you can tailor them with the five band EQ and a lot of buds that have sound personalization nowadays most of them do and this is definitely the strangest that I've tried as you run through the test you kind of just adjust the volume of certain instruments then you get your tailored sound and once I ran through the test and adjusted all the volumes to what I thought was best it didn't really change the sound too much which is why I dismissed this feature in the first place it's not until you fine-tune the sound where you can really start to get these sounding good and they should really explain in the app how this works but roughly the further to the right you go this is going to increase treble the further to the left this will increase the mids higher up is less bass and lower down is more bass so for me I like leaving the dot here close to the bottom right corner and with it there it increases the bass increases the mids and treble creates a much more direct sound to the point where I couldn't really recreate it in the EQ and also fun it increases the Sound Stage slightly as well as opening up the base so the bass doesn't really sound too centered it becomes a bit wider as well now I tried to play around with the EQ but I just couldn't match what the sound personalization did here because in the regular 5 band EQ you can push out some decent bass but it's very challenging to increase the treble to the point where the sound personalization does if you start increasing the trouble even the mids the bass automatically starts to decrease where with the sound personalization you get that nice full bass but the treble and mids don't fall behind somehow it's pretty insane and when I was filming some footage for this video I just did a quick screen recording I just did some random volumes in the test I actually think it sounded the best when I did that so if you want to copy that it's playing right now you can just look back copy that exactly and see if it sounds good for you but again I feel like they've got some algorithm going on so it does work with the kind of sound that you like to hear the only issue with it is that you can't EQ the buds further when you have the sound personalization saved and when you are doing the fine tuning you can't play your own music it's just the one default song that plays so it is kind of hard to hear the changes that you are making until you go back into your own song and you kind of you'll probably notice you might have to go back and forth a little bit but still this is definitely worth playing around with especially if you're a bit of a bass head like me and you want to get as much clarity as possible the momentum three were already the best at this with this sound personalization it just takes it to new levels so that's Dynamic and versatile if you want the buzz to sound balanced you're all good slightly bass boosted great over the top bass boosted Sandy's got your back and you get all this Freedom better than any earbud I've tested and that's why despite all the flaws I keep coming back to these earbuds and why I still think these are 100 worth it today if it's a dynamic and versatile sound you're looking for as long as the flaws don't freak you out but I've mentioned them but now if you want to see how the momentum 3 stack up against the best true wireless earbuds check out this video here where I compared scored and ranked the top six earbuds so check that out in the meantime stay key I'll see you in the next one bye now
Sennheiser MTW3," - This is one of the most
generic looking boxes I've ever seen, look at it compared to the Momentum True Wireless 2s. It's almost the exact same. If these were on the
shelf beside each other, you could easily grab the wrong one. What we wanna talk about is the Momentum True
Wireless 3 from Sennheiser. Are they even Sennheiser anymore? Turn great sound into your sound. We'll talk about why
they wrote that later. Oh, look at, they got
the German right there, (speaks foreign language) Here's the actual charging case. It has a fabric look, kinda like the cases
that Google was making for their pixel phones for a while there. And inside, ah, there it is. There's the earphones. Inside the box, looks like we
were gonna get some ear tips. And what is this? Might just have to, ugh. (laughs). This looks like they go around
the earphone on the outside. We'll try those in a bit. They're like wing tips to go into your, what is that called? Pinna, concha. I think that's a swear word in Spanish. Okay, here we go, a USB
A to C Cable for charging that plugs into the
front of the charge case. This also can charge wirelessly. They say seven hours on
the earbuds themselves, which can be extended to a total of 28, so an extra 21 hours
with the charging case. French. (paper thuds) Plug this in for 30 seconds. What is this trying to say? I'm not doing it anyway. I'm a hardheaded man-child. Tips, none of these are
foam, they're all silicone. There's three sizes, extra
small, small and large. Screw you if you're medium. - [Jono] No, I think
there's medium installed. (speaking foreign language) - Let's get a look at them. Maybe I'll open up the box from the 2s so we can see how they're different. But first I wanna try putting
this little ring on this side. Okay, it does come with one already. And so you can see there's
this little bulge in it. Can you see that? Right there, there's a little bulge. And then this one's bulgeless. This one's, little bulge here. So that's just gonna extend further and further into your concha. I usually just keep the stock ones on. You know what I should do though, is I should probably put a
different size on each one, because I feel like I always have a different fit on my left ear. All right, let's see
what the 2s look like. Very similar case. Although I would say this new case... Ah, the new case is definitely smaller. It's like a millimeter or less taller, maybe a centimeter shorter, and the width seems the same. How many bananas diff... Oh my goodness. - [Jono] (laughs) Oh no, banana down! - So yeah, the case is
definitely way more compact now. Just look at all the dead space they had between earphones before. So that's a nice improvement. And then they, for some reason, changed the position of the port. On the earphones, oh man, I don't wanna
mix up who's who here. (both laughing) So they were a little
shinier, brighter before. Now, these do come in three colors, there's basic black, white and graphite. I'm assuming this is graphite,
but they're less silvery. They're still very shiny. I can see that there are
three mics on this thing. There's one on the inside, and then there's two external ones. I'm gonna put on one of each and you guys can tell
me which ones better. What do you think? Huh or nah? - [Jono] That one - Looks better? - [Jono] Yeah, definitely. - Hell yeah, that's what you want. The new one's the good one, cool. Get this crap out of my face. All right, let's practice with my phone and check with the app. I hate when apps have little flaws like this at the beginning. Just let me in. I'll allow the permissions this one time. No device found, so clearly
I need to do something to start pairing them. There's no button in here,
which is actually my preference. I like when there's a
pairing button in the case. I find that's more intuitive than... ""Touch and hold both ear buds ""for three seconds and
start Bluetooth pairing."" Put 'em both in, touch and hold both. I hear nothing. I think I need to wake 'em up. I think I need to do this. I need a power source. Can I get a battery bank please? Pairing, cool. Let's get back in the action. Pairing successful, with a
slight British accent, nice. It's weird that it has
to look for the device when it's already connected to my phone. There we go. Okay, cool little interface here. Connections, just the Pixel 4. ""The Momentum True Wireless
so you can connect to, ""can only connect to one device at once."" Okay, so this whole... There's no reason for this page to exist. Oh, firmware update. ""The update will take 21 minutes!"" All right, I'll do this
damn firmware update, 'cause that gives me a great opportunity to talk about iSponsor, Joby. Joby is known for the unique GorillaPod, but they now have a brand new lineup of creator focused audio gear. There's the Wavo PRO a flagship on camera shotgun microphone
with active noise reduction the Wavo POD, a podcast or
gaming microphone ready to plug and play with USBC, the Wavo AIR a high quality wireless mic kit that's modular and designed
for the creator on the go, and the Wavo Lav PRO an ultra
small lavalier microphone that pairs perfectly with the Wavo PRO. So take your content creation to the next level with
Joby, using the link below. Wow, that update took a long time but we're back and we're into the app. Let's check out the equalizer
options we start with here. So it ships with it all
flat, which is cool. You can adjust the base mid and travel. And what are the steps kind of one DB steps up
to plus or minus six DB. I'm gonna leave it flat for now. I doesn't look like there's any presets
you can just save and name. Let's call this one too. Your own. Oh, there are pre other ones too. There's rock, pop, dance,
hip hop, classical movie. And then my custom ones are down there. All right. All I'm gonna keep it like that. 'Cause that's the best way to evaluate something like
this right off the bat. There's also base boost special EQ preset for more intense base. Podcast mode special EQ preset
for enhanced speech clarity. So that's just gonna boost up the frequency range
where the human voices. What, this thing just spoke to me. It said volume max. And I don't know why. I guess I tapped on it. That's gonna bring us
to what the interface is like which I am excited to hear about. Transparency mode is off, adaptive noise cancellation off for now. Let's play some tunes. This is loud enough for me already at 60%. So that's a good sign. Yeah, max is pretty loud, it's not super loud, but it's
pretty loud. (fingers snaping) I can't really hear my snapping right now. Let's see what happens when I turn on the active noise cancellation (Jono lapping) didn't really seem to change much. All right. Now I'm gonna turn that off. Keep lapping. Okay, no real change. But what I don't understand is am I turning off
adaptive noise cancellation or am I turning off all
active noise canceling. - [Jono] Oh right. And I don't know. They do sound a little bright but not really that impressed, honestly. I wanna do the hearing test now and see if the EQ that this app shoots out for me makes these songs
that I love sound better. Oh, I need an account. I gotta play my own tracks. Oh, weird. Select the option that
sounds best for you. I honestly cannot tell like, if you were pressing the
button and I wasn't looking, I wouldn't even know
you pressed the button. (Jono laughing) This is not what I was
expecting for this flow. Oh wait, I can tell
the difference on this. A and B are similar, but
C is like way different. It's like this one guitar is getting put under water when I hit C. I think I like B. All right. It just boosted the
crap out of the trouble. But the trouble was the thing I thought was too bright at the
beginning, too harsh. So now like, I'm gonna save this. I'm on that preset now, I'm
gonna go back to the song. I was playing a few minutes ago and see if I still think it's too harsh. I don't know. Am I just used to it now? This isn't a review, whatever. Let's see what the features are. Tap on the right, pause. Tap on the left did not unpause. Oh, that's transparency mode. Hey, what's up guys. - [Jono] Hey. - Hello. Can you hear me now? (Jono laughing) - Good. - [Jono] Banana phone. And now do, do, do, do do it's either A and C or not. Also what the hell's going on. Sometimes it's playing and
changing transparency mode. Why is the music playing and pausing? Is there two functions
bound to this one button? What kind of... I guess I'm just turning
transparency on and off. And when you're on
transparency, mode pauses 'cause you're trying to listen to somebody and then you put it back
to A and C and it thinks, well you probably wanna also play music. Then I can pause it over here and A and C is still on. Okay, so it's making an assumption there. They made a design decision
there, I guess it's defensible. Double tap. Next song. Triple tap. I gotta say, oh, what the hell? Google assistant on triple tap. Get outta here. I have to say the hapics are good every time I tap it
seems to register a tap. There's also these little feedback sounds when I triple tap it
goes, it doesn't just go. poo, poo, poo, it goes poo, poo, poo. Like the second and third
hits have different sounds. Okay, so how do I go back a song? Is it double tap on the left? Yes, what if I triple tap this one? It goes poodook, but I'm not talking. I don't know what that is. I'm gonna look in the app, it'll tell me. Also, is there a long press volume max? Okay, so you hold and it goes ramps down. Can you see that on here? That's really weird. It's like the headphone has its own volume range that's
decoupled from the phone. 'Cause I'm not seeing the volume
meter go up and down here. And when I turn this up to
follow your max, I'm still here. So it's like you have two
volume knobs to adjust. It's like on your TV,
you might have a stereo and you set your knob and
you just leave that knob, and then you use your TV remote
to like turn up and down. Might get annoying in the headphones. Kind of use case though. Touch control. Or you can just say able to
touch controls completely too. That's that's gonna be handy. All right. So you get left and right. 1, 2, 3 taps and a hold. Sometimes what you see in these apps is with a certain interaction,
like say one tap you only are allowed certain actions. You can't just do all the actions coupled with any of the
interactions they limit you for some like artificial reason which is super annoying,
here with one tap. I get a lot of options. It looks like I'm not limited in any way. You can make anything go from no function, plane, pause, next track, previous
track the voice assistant and that's what this is bound to. And that's why it's highlighted volume up
and down power on and off. So the triple tap is noise installation and the single tap is transparency mode. So that's what it was
when it was going do-do but I couldn't tell I'm really impressed with the interface here. Can we get that fan going? I'm gonna try some, A and C on and off and I'm gonna try
this wind anti-wind mode. I can feel this. I can barely hear it. It doesn't seem to be affecting the sound of the sound of music,
but let's do a call. Hey, what's up buddy? I'm just doing a test
call on short circuit. Really, I sound terrible. I have a fan pointed at me and I have the anti-wind feature on. I'm gonna turn it off and you tell me if I sound
even more terrible, right? I'm gonna say one consistent note and then you tell me if
it's how it gets better. - I'm gonna go. (hauling) Did it get better or worse throughout
that, you couldn't tell. Okay, all right, thanks. I'm satisfied with that. See you later. Cold ended. I really like the voice. Oh, transparency mode with music. So I think that's the toggle. So what was the command before? It was single tap. Okay, so if I hit that off with music. We got there guys, we figured it out. Closed the loop on that one. It's a setting. Well, okay, it's cool. You seem to get a lot
of settings with this. Oh man, I have such disgusting wet ear wax especially on the left,
like the right's okay. But danm! Sound zones allow you to automatically apply your
sound settings when entering or leaving a sound zone. That's dope actually, 'cause you could be like,
all right, whenever I walk into this part of the office,
I want transparency on. Like if I leave my desk,
I want transparency on. If I walk into the gym, I want A and C on. Or if I walk into my home I want the volume maxed. (both laugh) Get away from me. Continue without our location permissions. Oh, whoa, sweet, okay. So I just zoom in. You can only go down to a hundred meters. Okay, you're definitely not
doing rooms in your house and maybe if you have a big
office this'll work, but okay. So the actions when entering the noise zone, noise control is the term for active noise canceling
or transparency are off. You can choose a different EQ. That's kind of interesting. It's like pretty basic,
but it's pretty cool. Great excuse to give
away your location data. There are pretty good headphone the sound didn't blow me away. But one thing that's really nice is that somehow throwout a global pandemic, a chip shortage inflation
hitting record numbers. These went down in price 50 bucks. The first and second models of this headphone were $300 Us dollars. Now they're 250, that's crazy. Were they making too much money before they just had an
acquisition or they got sold? So maybe they got some synergies, I don't know, but they cut the price. They're competing in a
different bracket now. I guess they're the same
price as their pros pros. Now this case is definitely bigger and lamer or I'd like the experience of them a lot more than
the sound necessarily but the sound is definitely good enough. This is my new rating system actually. I'm not giving
recommendations or don't buy I'm not giving ratings outta 10, like we do on they're just movies, the movie podcast that
you should subscribe. Instead I'm giving facial expressions. So this is good. This is the cent. And that's what these get. (both laugh) Right, thanks for watching ""Short circuit"" subscribe come back for
more banana reviews. I like 'em when they're spotless and slightly green, but if they're black then you can make some bread with them."
Sennheiser MTW3, hey there i have sennheiser's momentum true wireless three earbuds here and i have to admit i was pretty excited to get my hands on these the previous model was really good but it did leave a little room for improvement so i was curious to see how sennheiser upgraded this third generation version and how it stacks up to other top noise cancelling earbuds like sony's wf-1000x mark iv let's talk about that [Music] okay for starters these cost a little less though they're still pretty pricey the momentum true wireless ii let's call them the mtw-2 for short listed for 300. they've been selling for 250 or less online the mtw 3 are 250 out of the gate and i suspect we'll see them for closer to 200 in the not so distant future they're also 16 smaller than the mtw-2 and come in three color options i have the graphite color here which i think is pretty slick but you can also pick them up in black or white there are links to all the products mentioned in this video in the description below the design has changed the mtw and mtw2 had a more rounded look and these are more rectangularly shaped and share some of the same design elements as the septon cx true wireless and cx2 wireless plus buds the sennheiser released at more affordable price points last year the charging case looks similar to this mtw-2's case but it is a bit more compact it does offer wireless charging for those who want that feature the other big design change is the addition of a rubberized fin to help keep the buzz in your ears more securely it's not a big wing like you'll find on sennheiser's new sport true wireless earbuds or the beats fit pro it's more subtle kind of a bump or ridge i started with the default medium-sized fin then moved on to the large fin the bud stayed my ears fine with both sizes but i got a little more secure fit with the largest fin and used that when i was running and had no problem keeping the buds in my ears they're ipx4 water resistant so they're splash proof and survive just fine after i left them out in the rain for 15 minutes needless to say you'll have to play around with the fins and tips to see what combination gets you the most comfortable fit with the tightest seal but by making the buds a little smaller they should fit a wider spectrum of ears and while i can't tell you if they'll be a perfect fit for your ears particularly if you have really small ears i do like what sennheiser has done with their design and they are more compact than the cx true wireless buzz and the sony wf-1000x mark 4 buds in fact for those of you who found that the otherwise excellent sony's cause some discomfort these might be a good alternative i'll get into how they sound and perform in a minute but first i'm going to give you a quick rundown of their key features as noted they have active noise cancelling it's the adaptive variety you can't adjust the levels and there's also a transparency mode that's an awareness note that lets sound in it sounds pretty natural but it isn't quite as natural sounding as what you get with the transparency mode on the airpods pro you give a quick tap on the left butt to toggle between noise cancelling and transparency the buds do have touch controls and they are quite responsive there's also an anti-wind mode that's part of the noise canceling settings however as far as i can tell you have to access that through the app along with the equalizer settings you can customize the touch controls a bit and it's worth mentioning the tap and hold gesture allows you to adjust volume up and down on the buds themselves also you can use either bud solo left to right and leave one charging in the case if you want additionally these have ear detection sensors so if you remove a bud from your ear your music pauses and it resumes when you put it back in you can also have the butts shut down automatically after set time interval if you leave them out of their case that helps preserve battery life which is fairly decent at around seven hours at moderate buying levels that's the same numbers what you got from the mtw twos battery so no changes there these use bluetooth 5.2 alas at launch anyway they don't have multi-point bluetooth pairing which will allow you to pair the buds with two devices at the same time say a computer and your smartphone but i was told that the feature will be added with a firmware upgrade in the future that means that the chipset supports multi-point bluetooth pairing but the engineers are still working on the software to enable and make it work reliably that can be tricky with true wireless earbuds the budsport both the aac and aptx adaptive audio codecs many android phones support aptx and with the right setup going with aptx for bluetooth streaming may improve audio quality slightly that said i didn't notice a major difference going back and forth between an iphone 13 pro and a couple of android phones using the qobuz streaming service that does offer higher resolution streaming over aptx adaptive so how exactly do these sound well slightly better than the previous model which was one of the best sounding true wireless earbuds when it was released in 2020 while this new version has seemingly similar seven millimeter drivers the buds sounded slightly clearer and more accurate to my ears and also played slightly louder out of the box these have a slightly more balanced audiophile sound profile compared to the sony wf-1000x4 which have a little more energy in the base and are slightly warmer both have a pretty wide sound stage with relatively open big sound the sennheisers offer a bit more clarity and i end up using the soundcheck feature in the app to come up with a custom preset equalizer setting based on my listening tastes my sound profile ended up looking a little bit like the popular happy face profile with the bass and treble boosted a bit and the mids tone down a tad with that profile the earbuds sounded a little more like the sony's the bass came across as powerful yet well-defined the long and short of it is the mtw3 are totally really pleasant to listen to with smooth yet lively sound and nice detail they work well with a variety of music genres and i didn't experience any listening fatigue even over longer listening sessions i'll finish by talking about the noise cancelling and voice calling performance sennheiser has made some improvements with the noise cancelling and from my test standing in front of a noisy hvac unit in my apartment the noise cancelling appears to be right there with sonys and boses how well the noise cancelling muffles sound does depend on how tight a seal you get with the included ear tips but sennheiser does appear to have upped his game in the noise canceling department the same is true for voice calls these have three microphones on each butt and caller said they did a decent job reducing background noise when i was talking to them from the noisy streets of new york city there's a little bit of a white noise generated but they said they could hear my voice clearly when i spoke so voice calling performance has improved significantly from the previous model yeah so there's a lot of cars going by a fire truck just went by i don't know if you can hear my voice clearly yes i'm not really hearing very many um noises in the background i do hear a little bit of kind of a static or white noise but i feel like the the buds are doing a decent job of blocking out that distant noise still hear a couple of people chatting but um overall not too bad all in all except for the lack of multi-point bluetooth pairing at launch i don't really have anything major to complain about i don't think you get a huge bump in sound quality from the cx-2 wireless plus buds that cost less but the mtw3's design is sleeker and more compact and should fit more ears comfortably these buds also work better as a headset for making calls and the noise canceling is seemingly superior as i said they're pretty pricey but they're an excellent set of earbuds for both ios and android users it will hopefully improve a bit with firmware upgrades i do think they face a lot of competition there are now several premium buzz in this price range including the 200 beats fit pro that sound impressive and perform well and we could get new airpods pro with upgraded sound later this year but as of this moment they're definitely among my favorite new earbuds and are worthy of strong consideration especially if you see their price tip a bit but let me know what you think sound off in the comment section and if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david connor for cnet thanks for watching
Sennheiser MTW3, all right so I've reviewed a ton of earbuds over the last few years and one of my all-time favorite in terms of sound is the Sennheiser momentum true Wireless 3. with the release of the xm5 from Sony I had to put these two up against each other to see exactly how they stack up now as of this video you can pick up the momentum 3 for 180 bucks on Amazon which is roughly a hundred dollars less than the accent five so just keep that in mind as we move forward so let's go ahead and jump right into it starting with connection whether you're a team Android or team iOS you're going to be in good hands thanks to the companion apps that give you access to all of their features you also have multi-point connection which as we know is great for multitasking since you can connect to two devices at the same time and this is another reason that ecosystem doesn't really matter with these two because no matter what types of devices you own you can take advantage of that multi-point feature one one thing that's really convenient is that you can go into either app and see which devices you're connected to and if you want to make any changes the process is really simple now moving over to battery life you're getting very similar performance with the momentum 3 you can get around seven hours on a single charge with a total of 28 including the case with the xm5 you're going to get roughly eight hours on a single charge and a total of 24 with the case the xm5 do have the advantage as far as fast charging just three minutes in the case will give you roughly an hour of use versus 10 minutes in the case will give you roughly an hour with the momentum three and for those that find it to be useful both do support wireless charging now let's go ahead and talk fit I will say that both of these are extremely solid but if you plan on doing a lot of intense movement working out hitting the gym things of that nature the momentum 3 come with ear fins to help give you the most secure you're fit now as far as just everyday casual use I actually prefer the xm5 which is crazy for me to say considering my experience with the xm4 it could be the round shape that just helps them sit in the ear a little bit easier you do get the option of wearing detection on both so your music will automatically pause anytime you remove one of them from your ear they both also have the same ipx4 rating which makes them safe from sweat and light splashes of water now moving over to touch controls if you watched my previous videos on the xm5 then you know it takes four taps on either earbud to adjust your volume with the momentum 3 you can customize the volume controls to be whatever you want I have mine set to a long press so I can simply tap and hold the earbuds until the volume is exactly where I want it which is much easier than having to tap the xm5 four times for each volume adjustment so a question question that I get asked a lot is which pair of earbuds are the best for strictly sound quality and the earbuds that I've suggested the most over the past year or so are the momentum three I feel like they give you the best of both worlds very satisfying bass and also really great clarity when it comes to the treble combine that with the custom EQ and you have a very capable set of earbuds they now have a personalized sound option that will customize the EQ for you and that's actually what I recommend to get the best sound the xm5 has a similar feature in addition to some basic presets that you can try both earbuds sound great it's honestly hard to go wrong with either one but of course you'll notice some slight differences when it comes to the bass I feel like the momentum 3 has a little bit more flexibility there's excellent extension into the deeper sub bass but you're also getting some really nice Punchy mid Bass the xm5 also has great bass response it's punchy it's tight controlled I just feel like it doesn't extend as deep as the momentum 3. both options give you some really nice clean treble but what stands out to me the most is the presence that you get in the upper mid range with the xm5 they do a great job of making things like vocals sound a little bit more rich and defined like I said they both sound phenomenal for me I typically go for a v-shaped type of sound so I find myself leaning more towards the momentum 3 but honestly that's more personal preference than anything so long story short they both sound excellent moving over to noise cancellation this one is pretty straightforward I would give the advantage to the xm5 as we know they have the foam ear tips that give you that extra bit of passive noise cancellation in addition to the active noise cancellation as far as the transparency mode I actually prefer the momentum 3. I think they sound a little bit cleaner and just pass your surroundings through slightly better than the xm5 however if you're in a very quiet environment you will pick up on some slight white noise so very faint almost static type of sound on the other hand if you're Outdoors or somewhere in public that's relatively noisy you're not really going to notice it now moving things over to call Quality I would actually say that both of these are solid to me the biggest difference between the two is that the momentum seem to filter out more of the lower end of The Voice which helps the voice stand out from any background noise alright so right here we have the Sony wf-1000xm5 outdoor microphone test as you can see next up we'll see how they compare to the Sennheiser momentum chew Wireless 3. and now we have the Sennheiser momentum three same outdoor environment as you can see test testing one two three testing testing one two three so that's my take on the xm5 versus the momentum 3 as you guys know really comes down to personal preference and what's most important to you I will have the links to both of these down in the description if you're interested and aside from that as always appreciate you guys for watching and I'll see you in the next one foreign [Music]
Sennheiser MTW3, [Music] now let's move on to these reviews many of you requested for this one so here I am comparing the Sony WF 1000xm5 with the Sennheiser momentum tw3 this is going to be interesting because since my last review the mtw3s have undergone a few upgrades and now they're very competitive with the Sony's in terms of features some examples are a new Five band graphic EQ and a feature that personalizes its sound to your tastes kind of like Sony's find my equalizer more on that later it doesn't do hit tracking but just like the Sony's they now do support spatial audio on devices running Android 13 or later great for watching videos on apps like YouTube or Netflix and though the ntw3 birds themselves aren't high-res certified like the xm5s a previous update also added a high-res audio mode to the mtw3 so yes the wf1 exam fives made a strong entrance into the market but the sennheisers are not playing around either in this video we're gonna see how they compare in terms of call Quality noise canceling and sound and after the comparisons we'll talk about what I prefer about the Sony's and what I prefer about the sennheisers as usual sound samples are coming so listen with earbuds to hear the difference better there will be more xm5 comparisons coming soon so if you haven't already get subscribed and tap the Bell button to get notified right now we're going to compare their call Quality in both quiet and noisy conditions with some width noise coming from this fan hi zombie today phone calls in a quiet place using the Sony wf-1000xm5 I'm not making a phone call in a quiet place using this advisor mtw3 by now we're taking a phone call with an employee picks using the Sony WFT I have now making a phone call in a noisy Place using this from azure mtw3 foreign conditions my voice on the sunnis sounded more full-bodied and loud but in noisy conditions I didn't quite like how the Sony sounded it wasn't able to filter noise very well from my voice this enhances did that better but the sonis are still overall better than the mtw3 because it's more effective at The Cutting background sounds especially voices as you heard in the real life Cafe test and my voice was Amplified much louder on the Sony's compared to the mtw3 so whoever's on the line with you will have an easier time catching what you have to say if you use the xm5 earbuds and now we're going to compare their active noise canceling using the same Cafe noise as before [Music] foreign I think they both are very comparable with a slight Edge going to the sunnis because it's noise canceling is stronger against both low frequency rumbling and mid-range noises so in crowded places with lots of people around you talking or on the train on the bus you're going to get more silence out of the Sony's however the mtw3s are still no slouch in many different situations you are going to get a lot of Silence against the rumbling of the Metro the bus and planes not bad overall compared to many other earbuds by the way guys if you want to compare the xm5's call Quality and active noise canceling to other earbuds do become a member for one dollar per month or more this gives you full access to my personal comparison tool which you can use to compare earbuds A to B at your own time and at your own pace many people have joined up especially people who can't just simply

click on the link below to find out more in terms of transparency this one needs have a bit more occlusion so it feels like your ears are a little more blocked but it's a lot less hissy compared to these advisors whereas the sennheisers even at medium transparency it has a lot more hits at Max transparency it just amplifies everything louder including the yes which I don't quite like but even on medium settings I do admit that decent houses sound more clear and transparent than the Sony's when you activate transparency mode in terms of sound quality frequency sweeps on their default settings show that the mtw3s have more emphasis on the sub bass and lower mid-range so vocals are going to sound a bit heavier and thicker more mellow while the eggs and Vibes are tuned to sound crisper and airier so you do feel the richness a little less yes but you also do hear a bit more vibrant on the Sony's listen to the following sound samples and tell me in the comments what you think [Music] again [Music] to go into a little more detail when I was listening to Diana krall's east of the Sun in titles Hi-Fi Master decennheisers do deliver more detail in the mid-range as in I can't feel the impact of the piano keys the tremble of the bass strings and the richness in diners vocals are a little more on these Anheuser as well the sunnis instead did a better job at conveying the crispness of symbols guitars and the airiness of a live concert they both sounded quite impressive but in different ways one more thing I should add is that if you're a base head and you like playing your music at very high volumes these analyzers seem to be able to maintain its tuning a bit better at higher volume levels especially in the base region whereas on the Sony's if you go beyond 70 or 80 volume it seems that it tends to Nerf the bass a little more so if you like listening to Bass see music and you like listening to them loud as much as I don't recommend listening to loud music for standard periods because of how it may harm your hearing if that's what you like these advisors will be able to maintain its tuning a little better at those kinds of volume levels however do note that this is on default settings by using their respective apps it's still possible to tweak them to sound more rich or crisp or Bassy whichever you prefer and it's easier than ever with Sony's find my equalizer and sennheiser's sound personalization in my opinion I do prefer Sony's to find my equalizer it sounds more accurate to what I want because I am able to use my own music as a bass line which is impossible on sennheiser's system what Sennheiser system is better at doing is to improve dynamic range by capturing how sensitive your ears are to soft sounds but the overall end result required a bit more tuning on the mtw3 than what I got on Sony's system by the way guys if you want to compare the sound quality of these earbuds to your other earbuds visit Loudoun wireless.com's sound samples page Link in the description okay now we're going to talk about why I prefer the Sony xm5s it's active noise canceling is more powerful than the mtw3 it's far more portable coming in a much smaller case compared to the sennheisers and while yes I can acknowledge that the sennheisers have come a long way in terms of features after the updates I do think that the Sony WF doesn't xm5 is still a bit stronger on that front because it's got head tracking a highly effective EQ suggestion system and things like DSE extreme which can even upskill old music files to make them sound more high-res the Sony's user experience also feels a bit more fluid while when I was operating these anhyzers I did run into some Kinks with software for example there were times when the device switching didn't work when I was managing the sennheiser's connections in the smart control app or when I couldn't even get the app to pick up the mtw3s even though it was already paired to my phone very weird those are some minor annoyances which coupled with the xm5's superior active noise canceling are reasons for me to pick the xm5s over the mtw3 that being said there are some very tangible reasons why I do prefer the sennheisers for example their controls are more customizable than the Sony's right down to the individual cap gestures these are also easier to grip it's not glossy like the Sony switch in the time I spent with them tends to get a bit more oily and slippery when pulling them out of my ears out of the case drop risk alert these sennheisers also got stability wins which means they do feel a bit more secure in my ears just some very small things which makes decennheiser a bit nicer to use than the Sony's some may even prefer the mtw3's sound which is more mid-heavy and mellow by default but Others May pick the Sony's for its crispness in the vocals and airiness in The Sound Stage they both sound Awesome by the way so those are reasons to choose the xm5 earbuds and reasons to pick the sennheisers me I just think it's remarkable that even after being in the market for almost a year the mtw3s have improved to such an extent that it still is a top competitor against a hot new product like the xm5 earbuds but what do you think leave your comments below there will be more xm5 comparisons coming so if you haven't already make sure you are subscribed and press the Bell button to get notified and if you want to check if they're on promo I've got links to their Amazon and Lazada pages in the description box I'm also on Twitter where I tweet about random stuff so follow me there

Sennheiser MTW3, this episode is brought to you by the Bowers and Wilkins px7s2 wireless headphones hear what your music really sounds like in our last video about true Wireless iems we took a look at the second gen Apple airpods Pro and I said I think they are the best all-rounder that I've heard and used to date in that product and price category but at the end of the video I said that there is a true Wireless IM which I think sounds better than that Apple airpods pro version 2. and today we're going to look at that better sounding true Wireless I am [Music] thank you [Music] yep today we're going to be talking about the Sennheiser momentum true Wireless 3. now the shape of the earpiece is somewhere between the airpods pro and the Sony so it means that the for me the Sennheiser are not quite as comfortable as the airpods pro either version one or two because they're the same ear tip shape but in the long run for several hours I think they just shade the the Sony wf-1000xm4 on camper Factor and I think that's an important consideration if you're going to be wearing these true Wireless iems for several hours obviously for 20 minutes not really going to make a difference but for several hours it does with the Sennheiser if I'm playing the original master of those mind bomb I've mentioned this album several times in recent videos because I've used it a lot there's only just enough Headroom so volume basically in the Sennheiser to play back that album to satisfactory levels because many of you will know that albums mastered in the 80s whilst they are bigger in dynamic range they're also a little bit quieter right so we have to turn the volume up which we can do and there's only just enough volume in the Sennheiser compared to the apples and the sonus so that's a factor for you if you're worried about Headroom of quieter recordings the active noise cancellation on the Sennheiser momentum true Wireless 3 isn't quite as good as what we get from the Apple airpods pro version 2. he can go toe-to-toe with the Apple in the low end but the rest of the frequency spectrum especially the mid-range I think the Sennheiser let more sound through even when active noise cancellation is fully engaged because there are different steps of noise cancellation inside the app and it's the same story with transparency mode it's good but it's not great as it is with the apples although I've got to say I don't really worry too much about how good transparency mode is for me personally it doesn't really matter that much as long as I can hear roughly what's going on because if I'm going to have a full-on conversation I'm going to be polite and take my earphones out however the active noise cancellation inside the Sennheiser has a mode that specifically tackles wind noise and it's really really good just as it is with the Sony and the airpods pro don't have that we still have to deal with wind noise when we're moving on a bike or if yeah we're just out and about on a windy day although we do have to step the noise cancellation down when we're going to that wind reduction setting so it does let in a little bit more of sort of external noise in canceling the wind but I'm happiest most of all with that but what's frustrating for me with the Sennheiser is that that wind noise cancellation doesn't seem to work with phone calls so when I find people they complain that it's really windy outside when I'm not hearing that win through the earpiece I don't know why they're hearing it it's it's a bit of an odd one for me I don't quite know why that is if you know let me know in the comments below the accompanying Sennheiser app with the momentum true Wireless 3 is good it's easy to use it's nice and cleanly laid out although sometimes it does bug me because I fire it up and I'm trying to get it to to see the earphones even though the earphones are already connected to Bluetooth because my phone tells me that even though I'm already listening to music right but the the apps like nah these earphones are not connected I'm like what are you talking about so it can take sometimes up to a minute for the app to see the earphones not always but sometimes on haptics we get touch sensors on each earpiece so the left one if I click that I can cycle through transparency mode and active noise cancellation on the right one it's play pause and I think tap to pause is a little handier than being asked to click an apple airpod but volume control you have to sort of hold down for I think for up you have to hold down the right one for a couple of seconds and volume down the left one for a couple of seconds that for me is not quite as handy as the airpod pro 2's sort of swipe gesture on each ear stem [Music] foreign [Music] if you ask me which of these two earphones the Sennheiser or the Apple would be my pick for functionality and haptics and general usability I would absolutely pick the Apple however here comes the wrinkle because the Sennheiser just when playing music sound quite a bit better than the Apple and their main ingredient is a larger dose of clarity we can just hear more of the music we can hear deeper into the mix detail retrieval from the Sennheiser momentum true Wireless version three it's just better than the apples we get more detail and that means we get more air so this Sennheiser a definite area we get a better sense of instrument placement so spatial cues really so we know where things are and pianos and guitars they sound more lifelike more believable and strings they sort of Glide and glisten and horns they blat so I've been playing what was I playing I was playing some Michael nyman and then also some Thomas Dolby with the Jazz Mafia horns and I think it might have been some Bill Callahan and all three of those albums for me sound better through the Sennheiser than they do through the apple and the Sony in fact next to the Sennheiser the Sony wf-1000xm4 do sound really quite muddy they're good and they have lots of punch and they have a sort of big chunky sound but they don't have the the delicacy and the Finesse in the top end that the Sennheiser have but most noticeably of all of these qualities is that the Sennheiser give us better Dynamics both macro and micro so that's the shifts in sounds right the when a sound comes to life it kind of explodes and then Falls away again that's more obvious to me on the Sennheiser than it is on the Sony and the Apple airpods Pro second gen but then the kicker is that the Sennheiser momentum true Wireless 3 sell for less than the apples I think you can get the Sony for about the same price roughly 200 and something Euros but the Sennheiser sell for that amount 215 Euros I think I paid when I bought my pair no Sennheiser did not send me these I bought these to test them because I was curious because I wanted to know how they sounded compared to the Apple now I know so if you want the best all-round true Wireless IEM you still want the Apple it's still a great sounding earphone I would use it day to day no problem and I can't say that about the first gen airpods Pro but if I want to go out and I want to just listen to music because I think yeah the Apple are better with phone calls if I just want to listen to music I'm going to take the Sennheiser every time because they just sound quite a bit better than the airpods pro and that for me is a surprise finding anyway this video is short than usual because I just want to make you aware of what I hear from the Sennheiser momentum true Wireless 3. if you like this video please give us a like down below if you like my attitude towards high-end audio and audio and Bluetooth and true Wireless iems then please consider subscribing to this Channel and as always thank you ever so much for watching momentum true Wireless 3 isn't as good as the Apple airpods Pro not quite sorry let me do that again okay the active noise cancellation on the Sennheiser true Wireless after that again however the active noise cancellation inside the Sennheiser has a mode that specifically tackles wind noise it means that when however however sennheiten God on control I always say thank you not thank you idiot
Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2," The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are a 
frustrating product. They have a great,   comfortable design and some of the best noise 
cancellation I've ever experienced in a set   of earbuds. Unfortunately, though, they do 
come with quite a few downsides. But first,   let's talk about the good things about these buds. These buds are extremely comfortable. Bose gives 
you a bunch of what they call stability bands to   place around the earbuds. This allows you 
to get the most comfortable and stable fit.   There's a bit of a learning curve to getting them 
placed correctly on the buds. But once you figure   it out and put them in your ears, you'll 
likely find them to be quite comfortable. Now, before switching to these buds for 
six months, the buds I had been wearing   were the Sony WF-1000XM4s, which I've 
also reviewed. And in terms of comfort,   especially when you're wearing buds for hours on 
end, I found that the Bose buds are considerably   more comfortable. The Bose buds go less 
deep into your ear than the Sony ones. I can wear these Bose buds for hours on end. 
When I do, I find that they sound pretty good.   They're not as good as the Sony WF-1000XM4s, 
but I think you get a little bit more detail   in the music you listen to. And when I first 
got these, I did think their bass was a bit   much. But thankfully, they give you an EQ 
setting in the Bose app to make adjustments. With my adjustments, I was able to more 
closely match the sound profile I'm used   to with my Sony buds. Now, part of what makes 
any modern-day buds sound good to me is noise   cancellation. It's canceling out all of the 
ambient noise around you, allowing you to hear   a wider range of frequencies that aren't 
being drowned out by some external noise. And let me tell you, if you want the best noise 
cancellation, put in a set of buds today. I   think these buds are probably it. Their noise 
cancellation is very impressive. Especially if   you just go out for a walk in a city where there's 
a lot of noise, it just cuts everything out. Unfortunately, there are some annoyances that 
I've found with these buds. During exercise,   I'll find my buds will rotate slightly, just 
enough for them to let in more outside noise.   So every once in a while, I have to rotate them 
back in, so they slide a little bit more into my   ears. I know that when they're in there a little 
bit more, the noise cancellation gets better. Now, this could just be because I picked the wrong 
stability bands for these buds. But these were the   ones that seemed like they would fit the best. 
Now, another annoyance I've found with the noise   cancellation on these buds is that they don't 
do a great job of masking either high-pitched   noises or just really loud noises. Especially when 
I'm doing something like pounding out chicken. I've got to take these buds out because 
they'll just let in this clipping noise   or something every time the mallet hits 
the chicken. And this is not something   I've experienced with other audio devices 
like the AirPods Max or my Sony WF-1000XM4   buds. Another thing that's pretty good 
with these buds is transparency mode. I've actually got it enabled 
right now, and overall,   my voice sounds clear. I think this is 
one of the better transparency modes. It sounds a little distant, and it doesn't 
sound like I'm wearing earbuds. The AirPods Max   still have the best transparency mode, where it 
doesn't even sound like you're wearing headphones. Another great feature of these buds 
is their touch controls. Overall,   they've worked great. They not only 
let you play, pause, skip forward,   and skip back like you would expect with a pair 
of earbuds, but they also let you adjust their   volume by just swiping up and swiping down, 
which is a rarity in the world of earbuds. Another standout feature that Bose did a good job 
with is the setup experience with the Bose app.   Bose gives you clear instructions with animations 
to walk you through the product. Apart from the   initial setup and the EQ adjustments, I don't 
really go into the Bose app all that often,   except for making sure that the firmware on the 
buds has been updated and troubleshooting issues. Next, let's talk about battery life. Overall, 
it's been great. The buds are rated for six   hours of playback on a charge, and the case holds 
a further four charges, for a total of 24 hours   of playback. Just 20 minutes of charging 
will net you up to two hours of playback. So that's everything I've liked about 
these buds over the past six months. Now, let's talk about downsides. 
Unfortunately, with these buds,   there are quite a few. I guess that is the benefit 
of having a six-month review period. And if you   like the fact that we do reviews only after six 
months, make sure you subscribe to the channel. The first and most annoying downside I've 
run into with these buds is that sometimes   they'll just refuse to connect to my phone. 
To remedy this issue, I'll have to go back   into the Bluetooth settings on my iPhone, or in 
the Bose app, and manually connect to the buds. Another annoying issue I've run into 
with these buds are audio cutouts. This   typically happens when I'm out on a walk 
and I've got my phone in my pants pocket   with the case in my other pocket. I'll just 
get cutouts with whatever I'm listening to. Another annoyance I've had with 
these buds is that when I first   put them in and I'm getting ready 
to listen to a podcast or something,   I'm unable to trigger it by just long pressing 
the left earbud. The only way I've been able   to solve this issue is to take the buds 
back out and then put them back in again. Another downside I've encountered 
is that when I'm wearing the buds   and pick up a call on my phone, my 
iPhone won't automatically switch   the call over to my buds. I have to 
do it manually almost every time,   which is incredibly annoying. And it's something 
I haven't experienced as much with other buds. Another downside I've found with the buds is 
the microphone quality. It's just okay. Here's a   comparison of the microphone quality of the 
Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (QC2s) to the standard   second-generation AirPods, the Sony WF-1000XM4, 
the Pixel Buds Pro, and the Galaxy Buds Pro. As you can hear, the microphone quality of the   QC2s is just okay. It's not terrible, but 
it's not great either. I get the feedback   that people can't hear me very well, especially 
when there's traffic or other background noise. Oddly, Bose doesn't seem to use the tips 
of these earbuds for microphone placement,   like Apple does with their iconic stem design. I 
think this is certainly an odd choice. Typically,   the closer you can get a microphone to somebody's 
mouth, the better the overall vocal quality is   going to be. So I'm not exactly sure why Bose 
didn't take advantage of that in their design. Now, before we get to recommendations, 
there are a few more slides. One downside I need to cover first is the case. 
It's a bit big for my taste, and I think Bose   could do some work here to try and slim it down 
for their next-gen buds. Also, the case doesn't   support wireless charging, which for buds that 
cost close to $300 USD is a bit of a letdown. Given the high cost of these buds and the amount 
of downsides and issues I've had with them over   the past six months, unfortunately, I just 
can't recommend spending the money on them. which really sucks because the noise cancellation 
solution on these is pretty much best in class. I'll continue to check in on these buds 
after this review. If anything changes,   I'll leave that in a review follow-up in 
our free monthly newsletter, and if you   haven't done so already, I'll leave a link to 
sign up for it in the description below. If   you're in the market for a premium set of true 
wireless earbuds, Sony is rumored to be coming   out with their next generation of earbuds 
that will be comparable to this Bose set. And from the leaks I've seen, they should improve 
on their comfort. Or if you're an Apple user,   of course, looking at the AirPods Pro 
makes sense. And right now you can get   these Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds on sale for a 
hundred dollars off at the time of recording,   which I pointed out in our free monthly newsletter 
where I'll sometimes post deal alerts as well. If you want to learn more about these

Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2, hey folks these are the bose quietcomfort earbuds too in case you missed it they were announced on the same day that apple introduced the airpods pro 2 and iphone 14 and they kind of got a bit lost in the shuffle they cost 299 so definitely pricey but now that i got my hands on a pair i got to say they're really good they fit my ears really well have great noise cancelling excellent sound and improved voice calling performance we can debate at the end whether they're too expensive but before we do that let me go over what i think makes them among the top few earbuds and what i think some people may find a little lacking here we go [Music] okay so for starters you can only get them in black at launch triple black is what bose calls the color but to you and me it's black sandstone is coming later in the year personally i like the lighter color a little better but black's just fine and a lot of people prefer it more importantly not only are the earbuds about 30 smaller than their predecessors but their case is about 40 smaller and truly pocketable while the original quietcomfort earbuds featured excellent noise canceling and very good sound quality they were pretty hefty and protruded from your ears the new buds each weigh a little less than .25 ounces or seven grams according to bows still not spelt but significantly smaller the other big changes to the ear tips bose has ditched its one piece state ear wing tips for a two-piece fit kit system that features separate ear tips and stability bands in three different size options that's supposed to give users more flexibility to get a secure fit and tight seal i did like the state ear wing tips but after trying the new two-piece system i'm sold on it i ended up going with the large tips in medium stability band and that really locked the buds in my ears i can't tell you that these will fit everyone's ears equally well if you're someone who can't get a secure fit with the air pods pro 2 which are lighter and quite comfortable wear this new two-piece fit kit system may be a reason to give the bose a go over the new airpods pro a handful of new premium earbuds feature a kind of auto custom tube feature that takes into account the shape of your ears and ear canal and bose has also developed a new custom tuned sound calibration system to not only optimize noise canceling but the sound quality for your particular ears every time you place the buzz in your ears a proprietary tone is played and a microphone measures your ear canals acoustic response it takes about half a second or so but you definitely notice that the noise cancelling has undergone some optimization it's really impressive just how much the sound around you was muffled bose says it's targeted frequencies that were previously difficult to reduce in the mid and high range like the voices of nearby co-workers screaming babies and family distractions in your home office i used this in my home next to a relatively loud hvac unit and the noise cancelling basically completely silenced it was more impressed with how much sound it reduced when i walked in the streets of new york and rode the subway you can still hear people's voices but they seem to be muffled by about 60 percent it's a little startling when you take the buds out of your ears or put them into transparency mode just how much sound is being filtered out and yes that transparency mode bose calls it in aware mode it's also improved it does sound more natural and lifelike the best transparency modes like on the airpods pro make it seem as if you're not wearing earbuds and can hear the world as it would sound without earbuds in your ears these do a good job of getting you close to that sensation while the drivers appear to be the same or very similar to those found in the original quietcomfort earbuds those reps told me that thanks to the custom tune technology the sound is noticeably improved with more nuanced clarity depth and better accuracy and that's pretty much what you'll hear if you were to compare these to the originals everything is a little bit more clear and natural sounding their predecessors also had relatively big sound and by that i mean they have a pretty wide sound stage but the bass has a bit more definition and punch now and is a bit more detail and separation between instruments so you can hear them more distinctly i also thought they had just the right amount of warmth particularly with male and female vocals their tonal balance is overall very good while software and advanced algorithms play a big part in the quietcomfort earbuds performance they do feature four microphones in each but two of which are beam forming microphones to focus on picking up your voice voice calling performance was a weak point in the regional quiet comfort earbuds and boses clearly made an effort to improve it with better noise reduction and voice pick up during calls i think it's significantly better now but have a listen for yourself all right i'm in the streets of new york city i'm doing a test call right now with the earbuds i'll be blocked out by and large you sound very good to excellent when you're talking it sounds more like you're inside a big room not outside here's a tiny bit of background noise but when you're not talking you pretty much don't hear any background noise at all it's like the microphone goes dead as it should when you're not talking all right um there's a fair amount of street noise here there's a couple cars going by um i'm just talking a little bit more so that uh see what it sounds like when i'm talking okay on to battery life it's rated at six hours with noise cancelling on that's the same as the new airpods pro 2 and you get about three extra charges from the new trim down charging case which features usb-c charging but not wireless charging that seems a bit unfortunate since most earbuds in this price range including the airpods pro 2 feature wireless charging like their predecessors the quietcomfort earbuds 2 are splash proof with an ipx4 rating they also have similar touch controls with a swipe gesture for volume control that i like i thought the touch controls worked well and they are slightly customizable as for bluetooth flavors these are equipped with bluetooth 5.3 they use the aac and spc audio codecs but currently have no support for qualcomm's aptx audio codec or multi-point bluetooth pairing i was disappointed by that particularly by the lack of multi-point bluetooth pairing but there's some hope that that may change in the future that's because a bose rep told me that these earbuds are equipped with a 5 series qualcomm chip that chip supports multi-point bluetooth pairing and has app deck support so i think there's a good chance we'll see at least multi-point bluetooth pairing added in the future and perhaps other features it's worth noting that while the noise canceling is of the adaptive variety you can adjust its levels between three settings the earbuds also have adjustable equalizer settings so you can tweak the sound profile i'll finish by saying that i did compare these to some other top earbuds including sony's wf-1000x mark iv which were released in june of 2021 and lists for 20 less these bose buds have surpassed those sony buds not only in terms of sound quality noise canceling but also voice calling and fit we'll have a full comparison of the airpods pro 2 in a separate video i can't get into all the details on apple's new buds just yet but like i said if you're someone who can't get a really secure fit from the airpods pro these are a compelling alternative for a little bit more but the performance improvements to the airpods pro 2 make them a pretty safe and enticing choice for iphone users for 50 less than these that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider these if you're an ios user but the airpods pro have their own set of advantages for ios users the same can be said for samsung's excellent galaxy but 2 pro earbuds and samsung galaxy device owners those buds have certain features that only galaxy owners can take advantage of including high resolution audio over bluetooth if you have the right setup but again the quietcomfort earbuds 2 may offer a better fit for you and i do think they sound slightly better than both the galaxy butts 2 and the pixel buds pro and have better noise cancelling as i said if you can get a tight seal with these buds the noise cancelling is really impressive probably the best out there right now as always feel free to post your views in the comments section and let me know what you think about their new design and whether you think they're worth 299 dollars after what i've told you about them if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david carnoy thanks for watching [Music]
Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2, ow my little finger got caught in there what are the two best truly wireless earbuds on the market airpods Pro Gen 2 probably and the second one the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds 2. we tested them we're going to show you some graphs about how they sound objectively and we're also going to open this box up and see how they work start here at this QR code not doing that case is kind of weird shaped it's like a badge like a sheriff's badge and here are the buds themselves a cable USB a to c and some extra tips and fins small and large mediums already equipped and then you've got large and large I guess they're not small medium large they're just different bigger bump on these ones a lot of time they're Fitness oriented to try to you know keep them in your ears better but these fins are really low profile especially the ones that are presently equipped so I probably would just keep these on and actually I wonder if yeah they kind of look incomplete without them I peel that back and there's just like a little missing empty track now so how do they look pretty normal oh it just made a noise and that noise is actually a sort of calibration for your ear canal it's called Bo's custom tune and when that noise is being played it's kind of like you can think of echolocation it's measuring how long it takes the source signals that it sends out there to bounce back and return and making like a map of your ear and then tuning the sound based on that I like that there's no user interaction it's not like a part of the app where you have to go to and say like test my hearing it's just part of using them and it sounds pretty cool not a great lid sound not a really satisfying hinge or snap open either for the fidgeters among you but it's a pocketable case I'd say not as Tiny or smooth as this apple just kills it but this isn't a Bose versus airpods video there's an app and I'm going to try to add these earphones to it little button there they are connect the magic experience okay battery levels on the left and right are exposed here but what about uh the case itself it doesn't tell me there's an EQ which is nice I don't believe the airpods have that at all but other than presets this gives you the actual control up to what do they call plus and minus 10. it's only three different levels so you get your mid lows mids and highs not as nice as having like a full Matrix where you can do it in different like discrete jumps of frequency range left shortcut touch and hold the left earbud to use your shortcut so that's the only button that you can adjust hey play and pause the thing with these is it's always either on or transparency is odd on you can't just turn it off which you can with the airpods you go ANC on ANC off transparency on I want to find out what it feels like to adjust the ANC and the transparency levels but before that I gotta just listen to these things thanks to pataka for sponsoring today's video if you talk it makes magsafe compatible armored fiber phone cases and accessories their light and thin design comes in black gray or a fusion weave design for those that want a little more personality they offer a whole ecosystem of magsafe products from their four in one mag easy slider the mag easy car mount Pro use their slider to charge your iPhone Apple watch and airpods all at the same time and with the strength of pitaka's magnets there's no need to worry about your phone slipping from the car mount even if you're driving over bumps they didn't say that part I I put that part in don't run people over though so check out pitaka in the links in the video description alright the music's playing and I tap to pause I kind of missed it pause play doesn't matter which one you use next track oh that's registered volume volume is is swipe but that double top registered as volume next I just next it right into an ad oh now I'm in aware mode okay so this is transparency is on but I can obviously still hear the music I'm in relax mode it's like the closest thing to off maybe Focus that's uh really similar to relax I don't know it's very ambiguous that's the default interface you can change the press and hold to to not cycle through modes but instead hail the assistant and I believe that's just on the left but here's an explanation of what the modes are quiet has a little information guy beside it mutes the world around you so you can better hear and feel it okay so it's ANC on but aware it doesn't have that little info thing it has a settings button here are your surroundings and your music at the same time it has active sense if things get too loud Bose automatically adjust the amount of noise cancellation so that you can enjoy music comfortably that's the same thing that airpods have so basically there's like a decibel like limit I believe it's 85 decibels on the airpods and anything that's louder than that just gets brought down uh you can turn that on and off on here obviously you don't have a choice on airpods everything is just the way that Apple thinks you want it you can like set anything in relax there's no verbal explanation or written explanation of what it is but you can switch up the noise cancellation aggressiveness my voice is very isolated all the hissing that was around me went away now it's like there's like a a distant highway or like white noise generator somewhere as far as like whether or not turning this up and down makes it more like cabin pressure feeling e not really I kind of feel like it when it's Max but it might be just an illusion because of the other things that change now what happens when I look at Focus mode same deal different starting point maybe so for both Focus and relax where you have the ability to change this if you go below middle that's like amplifying the transparency mode and if you go above the middle that's like amplifying the active noise canceling if you're in the middle I guess you get a bit of both you can kind of hear the world around you but engine noise and air conditioning are kind of blocked out that's cool and you can save these presets too you can actually rename them oh they give you some things um to choose from like walk and work out I don't see how I can type my own that's why not you guys whatever but that's nice you know you could go from the preset I like when I'm in the office versus the preset I like to have when I'm walking to the office kind of annoying that there's four I wish I could disable some of them so that when I'm cycling through it's just two or three oh it's so annoying if I tap here it should turn it up to that point you shouldn't have to swipe what you can see here is how the headphones measured which is the green line versus the Harman Kardon Target line so why isn't it just zero zero being a flat frequency response where nothing is above or below the artist's intent basically well the reason is your ears are imperfect your ears are actually more sensitive to different frequency ranges than others so for example you can see that the Harman Kardon curve says that you should probably crank up the bass and the high because we're less good at hearing those sounds we're better at hearing mid-range because that's where human voices and lots of other sounds in nature that are relevant to us like those boxes falling ah I love you so much so as you can see this follows that Target curve really nicely almost the whole way except for around 2.5 k there's a little bump so to some people by default these might sound a little bright you can use the EQ that we saw on the app to turn that down a little bit so on this chart what you're looking at is what we call purse of equal loudness so because your ears are less sensitive to Bass when you turn your music to a low volume A lot of times we just can't hear the bass anymore so on your stereo AVR or on either of these pairs of earphones they'll actually compensate for that so you can see in this chart they base the Boost quite a bit and when you turn up the volume Green's a little louder and orange is louder than that this stuff mostly happens on the low end the base which is the left side now dynamic range compression is not something that's happening on purpose on on the earphones this is basically you turn up your music really loud and the load that you're putting on the headphones starts to exceed their capabilities like they just requires too much power or they're going to clip or something they will actually play certain frequencies more quietly because they just can't deliver so you can see on the right side of this graph if you turn them up really loud which is the red line under 2K it starts to drop off and then above 12 or 13k it like hits a cliff and so if you're listening to like a really high delicate violin it'll be quieter so like that as you turn up the music the the prominence of that violin may be sounding like it's in the foreground and nice and clear and Loud it'll just start to kind of back away and be and quieter and quieter and you can see the Orange is uh lower volume than red and green and blue are lower still so it's really only when you crank it pretty loud here if you're looking at the left side of the graph don't pay attention to that it's not that you're getting less bass as you crank these loud this is actually just a Vestige of the curves of equal loudness so it's just kind of like a measurement problem another interesting thing is if you turn it up really loud and the headphones can't deliver it you might actually hear this as like pumping like the music is kind of surging and getting quieter and the reason for that is that music isn't of equal loudness as a song plays like every bar there could be a kick drum and then that could be more load than the quieter parts of the bar in between kick drums so that means that the load imposed onto the headphones every bar varies and when it's a lot of load that's when the headphones kind of hack it anymore and that's where you're gonna see drops on the graph because when those impedances hit they just can't deliver all the power that they need to but then an instant later in the song There's not as much music happening and they can deliver and the volume kind of picks up again so you get this surging effect in in volume the next graph is a comparison between the bows and the airpods for noise cancellations so lower is better here you can see that in general the airpods have better cancellation especially in the mid-range but there is a one spot where the bows do a lot better it's around five kilohertz there's like a 10 DB difference all sounds that you hear have a mix of frequencies it's not just like engine noises all all low even engine noise is going to have some High bands in it as well so it's hard to say like that five kilohertz spot is where you're gonna hear this instrument or something like that it's all kind of like in general but you can see that both of these things don't really do much until you get around 60 hertz and that's kind of where you're going into the from sub bass to base because the sub bass stuff is stuff you're not going to hear it's stuff you're going to feel and obviously the noise cancellation isn't going to really affect that but in terms of uh noise you're going to hear on a plane it looks like the Bose does just as well but the airpods appear to do better with voice voices that's where you can see that mid-range people talking babies crying uh airpods might be a little bit better but these are both doing pretty well for battery life they're advertising six hours that's on the buds they actually don't tell you what they expect to get out of the case they do tell you that you can charge the case in three hours and you can charge the buds in one hour and 20 minutes after charge gets you two hours of playback so oh they're okay pretty standard the price though they are 300 which is fifty dollars more than the airpods so if you're an iPhone person I I Feel Like These are pretty neck and neck in a lot of ways but that price and that Apple Magic you're gonna get is you might want the airpods for everybody else you're not gonna get any Apple Magic on your Android device and these are very good so um maybe that extra 50 bucks would be worth it for you they definitely sound great and both of these are great earbuds Christmas is coming I don't think anyone can be really be mad if they get either of these so thanks for watching short circuit if you

Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2, all right so since the release of the original bose quietcomfort true wireless earbuds these have been my number one recommendation as far as the best active noise cancelling earbuds that you can buy so whenever someone asks me which earbuds have the best anc i always tell them the bose quietcomfort now they're not my personal favorite as far as like sound quality and just everything across the board but in my opinion there's no question that they cancel out the most amount of noise out of any pair of earbuds that i've ever tried so when they announced the second generation of the quietcomfort earbuds i was super excited because i figured that they would address some of the areas that you know needed addressing with the original version but sadly that's not the case so we're going to talk about everything you need to know about these earbuds but first let's start off with something that they actually did get right which is the redesign of the case as well as the earbuds so a big gripe for a lot of people including myself is that the charging case on the first generation is super large and just overly bulky so i was definitely happy to see that they reduced the size and just made the case much more pocketable this time around there's still other options out there that have even smaller cases but you can clearly see this is a definite improvement over the first generation the earbuds are also noticeably smaller and more compact and this time around instead of using one solid ear tip with an ear wing attached they chose to use a combination of ear tips and what they call stability bands which are basically you know ear fins but the fact that they're separate from each other means that you can try a number of different combinations to get the best fit for your specific ears and speaking of the fit these work extremely well for me so we'll talk more about that here shortly another thing that they got right this time around are the controls because now you can control everything directly from the earbuds whereas before we didn't get access to everything so now you're able to play and pause you're able to track forward as well as track backward you can adjust your volume you can change your ambient mode as well as activate your voice assistant so that means fewer times that you'll have to actually reach for your phone these also have in-ear detection so anytime you remove one of the earbuds from your ear your music will automatically pause so let's go back and talk about the fit obviously everybody's ears are different but for me the fit on these is incredible the smaller size along with the ear fins and the ear tips give me a very secure fit so i can absolutely wear these to the gym or go for a run or do any sort of physical activity and they're also really comfortable the first time i tried them on i ended up leaving them in my ears for about two hours which honestly never happens but again it's going to depend heavily on the size and shape of your ears so these are running bluetooth 5.3 and as far as codecs they're giving us the standard sbc and aac so no aptx no ldac or any of the more advanced options so that brings us to one of the elephants in the room and that is the fact that there's no single usage mode so i just knew for sure that they would fix this with the second generation because it was the same thing on the first generation but anytime you take the right earbud and place it into the case the left earbud disconnects and now i know before a lot of people will say oh it works as long as you don't close the charging case well to me that doesn't count yeah if you're you know using the earbuds on your computer and you're at a desk or something like that you could put the earbud in the case and just leave it open okay but to me that doesn't count what if you're outside and you want to use the left earbud independently you can't really put the case in your pocket and leave it open i mean i guess you could try but you shouldn't really have to do that with a pair of earbuds at this price point so the fact that in 2022 going into 2023 bose has released a pair of earbuds that don't give you the option to use them independent of each other it's kind of mind-blowing to me because i can get on amazon right now and find a pair of 20 earbuds 30 earbuds that give me that option so that's one of the features or aspects that has me kind of frustrated with these earbuds as far as battery life we're looking close to the same numbers as the first generation so we're going to get about six hours on a single charge with a total of around 24 including the case so the per charge use is the exact same as before but we are getting about six additional hours from the case and they also support fast charging so just 20 minutes will give you around two hours of listening time now this brings us to the second elephant in the room and that's the fact that they took away wireless charging so they upped the price and then took away a feature as significant as wireless charging that's another decision that i don't quite understand now i'm not a you know wireless charging exclusive type of person like i can live without wireless charging but on a pair of flagship earbuds at this price point that is a feature that i pretty much expect so the fact that they took it away has me very frustrated as well another feature that i don't necessarily expect but would have been nice is multi-point connection so with these you're not able to connect the two devices and switch back and forth between the two however the earbuds can remember multiple devices and then you can switch the connection using the bose music app so as far as water resistance these have an ipx4 rating which means they'll have no problem with standing sweat and light splashes of water so that's going to be useful if you're a very active person just make sure you don't completely submerge them in water so let's go ahead and talk active noise cancellation these are still giving you top tier performance so they're going to be great at blocking out lower frequency sounds but not only that these are also surprisingly good at blocking out higher frequency sounds like voices which is usually pretty tough when it comes to anc earbuds so if your number one goal is to block out as much noise as possible there's nothing that's going to give you better performance than the bose quiet comfort 2. as far as the aware mode or ambient mode it does a great job of allowing you to hear your surroundings so it's going to be useful if you need to have a conversation or just be more in tune with your surroundings i do think there's other options out there that have more effective ambient modes overall but you can certainly get by with the performance on these the ambient mode also has an option called smartsense which will reduce sudden loud noises so this is going to help prevent the earbuds from blasting your eardrums if you're in a quiet environment and then all of a sudden there's a really loud noise and it actually works really well but i feel like sometimes it reacts to sounds that aren't really that loud so it can become a little distracting at times so as far as sound quality bose always gives us some very well balanced sound especially in terms of treble and clarity and that's still the case with the quiet comfort 2. except this time around i feel like there's slightly more emphasis on the bass it comes off a little bit more pronounced compared to the first generation which is great if you prefer a little bit more punch in terms of bass otherwise you can tone the bass down using the in-app eq so while these earbuds are definitely delivering some very enjoyable sound quality i think more than anything you're paying for the performance of the active noise cancellation so really quick let's go ahead and do a quick microphone test all right so this is a microphone test of the new bose quiet comfort 2 true wireless earbuds so right now we have quiet conditions so this should give you an idea as to how you would sound in a quiet environment now let's see how they sound once we add some background noise all right so now we got some crowd noise being played on a speaker so this should give you a rough idea as to how you would sound if you choose to take calls in a more noisy environment testing testing one two three testing testing one two three so overall these still hold the number one spot as far as active noise cancelling ability the sound quality is also slightly improved and they're much smaller and much more compact but the fact that there's still no single usage mode along with the fact that they took away wireless charging both of those things are very hard for me to look past especially at this price point so i'm curious to know what you guys think make sure you let me know down in the comment section below

Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2, one of the most popular videos on this channel is when I reviewed the Bose qc2 earbuds many of you subscribed to my channel because of that video and some of you might be wondering I've had the bows for almost a year now and in that time there have been several firmware updates and even some new features that were added later on like the ability to use the left and right earbud alone adaptive transparency so in all of that time have I changed my mind at all about the Bose qc2 buckle up because I'm going to talk about its pros and cons after 300 days of using these earbuds and are they worth buying if you want to check its latest price I've included a link to it in the description below first let's talk about the pros as a reviewer I have so many buds in my collection but I just keep coming back back to the Bose qc2 for several reasons and reason number one is the fit these offer one of the best stability and comfort and the wings keep them in place very well I myself do use them a lot for running half an hour on the treadmill with these earbuds and no matter how sweaty my ears get these remain stable second the controls it has big touch pads which allow for a wider range of controls on each earbud music playback ANC and transparency toggles and it's also possible to swipe and control the volume on both ears so if you want to use just one earbud alone and leave the other in the case you still have full access to all of the controls that's worth mentioning because of how rare it is now off the top of my head the only other one that lets you do that full range of controls on one earbud is the airpods pro 2. but if I'm wrong and there are others in the market that can also do that let me know in the comments third the sound now this is going to be a pretty controversial take because the qc2s were never really meant to appeal to audio files and what audio files are looking for is mostly that golden hi-res Wireless label which is the next best thing to pull high-res but I find that it's audio quality is good enough to please most people and not bad enough to piss anyone off avoiding many of the mistakes that other brands make like overly aggressive mids boomi bass or sibilance now I won't go so far as to say that this sounds amazing but for me its track separation is clean enough it's detailed enough Bassy enough and it's sound staging is open enough to enjoy if you want to compare its sound quality to buds from other brands visit Loudoun wireless.com sound samples page Link in the description and the last point of why I keep coming back to the Bose is its active noise canceling out of everything I've tested it cancels the most noise the it rumbling noises dumping down the sound of human speech it's really the only reason why I take these with me whenever I go on flights because crying babies yeah it's become indispensable really and if you do take it to the gym like me the ANC on these do not stutter when you run it may not be the most portable but for that kind of noise canceling end the way it maintains ANC Power by locking into my ears properly while being comfortable to wear that's a trade-off that I'm willing to make actually this is a nice segue to the first cons of the qc2 which is its size it's gotten a lot smaller compared to the first version which was a dinosaur but still bulky compared to my other daily driver the Sony link Birds s which is really a cute little thing compared to the Bose qc2 now I don't mind just bringing these buds with me put them in my ears and leave the case at home because it's battery life is not bad but if I do need to bring the case with me because I'm meeting friends or going to events and usually just bring something else with a case that's more convenient and less bulging the second con is it's called quality this is something that many Brands can get quite right because of how difficult it is after all these things are so far away from your mouth but they're expected to pick up your voice while ignoring every other ambient noise now this stuff is hard but right now it's getting better the nothing here to use call Quality is quite impressive as are some other products but I can't say the same for the qc2 it's usable in quiet scenarios but if you do need to take a call in a noisy place your voice is either gonna sound very far away or a lot of the noise is gonna leak in it won't really block wind noise either so the person on the line with you is gonna hear flapping noises the third con is that you can't turn off active noise canceling it's either different levels of noise canceling or transparency now the reason why somebody might want to turn off ANC is to conserve battery but you don't even have that option at all on the Bose qc2 con number four is that it still does not have multi-point pairing which is the ability to connect up to two devices at once and seamlessly switch between them most premium buds already have that but the Bose still doesn't so even if some things have improved over the past year which makes these better value today compared to you when it first came out like single earbud use and active sense transparency the fact that it still lacks multi-point does mean that it's still lacking in terms of features compared to competitors from Sony Sennheiser and others but keeping in mind the pros and cons and the updates that have improved it I'm more comfortable now recommending these compared to when it first launched if you need insanely good and reliable noise canceling fit and comfort I mean

Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2, I am holding two of the best noise canceling earbuds on the market Apple's earbuds Pro 2 and Bose's quiet Comfort earbuds too I am here in a very noisy London putting these two through some real world tests [Music] okay before we start a little housekeeping both buds are going to be on full noise canceling to keep things a little straightforward we'll also be using the same track for consistency and the volume will be around a 65 Mark if you want to see more real world tests make sure to subscribe and if you want to know more about these buds head down to the link in description for more information don't forget to leave a like while you're down there too so the point of noise canceling is to lower the background in of your environment it's not really made to completely mask voices talking around you per se instead it's a combination of the noise canceling and your music that really cancels out the outside world and with that I'll be doing a little spoken word challenge I'm going to be listening to some music while Drew over here stands behind me and says a phrase he'll gradually get closer until I can hear what he's saying the buds that get him the closest wins [Music] we're going to try again I thought I I can't hear you I can't literally you were right here and then I heard but that was it I'd heard nothing that was amazing impressive stuff now let's see how the airpods do foreign [Music] like maybe a step further back I heard a little zoo and then when you got here I just about heard it just about heard it so I think it was definitely further away yeah I think the bows win that one wow uh I'd say a pretty good victory for the bows there I was able to hear Drew's words just maybe a foot behind me on the airpods both have made real strides with adding frequencies including that of human speech in their noise canceling so yeah I have to say this is a resounding Victory okay maybe not resounding because it was maybe in just a foot in it but winner of the boats next up I'm going to be putting these buds in various situations to see how they stack up against each other first up a puck so we're here in Regents Park and as you can hear there's a little bit going on you can hear water running from fountains some Wildlife distant traffic in the background so we'll see exactly how much of that is drowned out by the buds I put easily eliminate the background noises from the park I hear nothing of the crowd passing by me whether it be their footsteps or what they're talking about and the nearby water fountain is completely notable the airpods have handled this ably the bows match the airpods stride for stride nothing in the park gets through not the chirping of the birds the rushing Fountain the lawnmower off in the distance none of it really hard to pick these two buds apart so that was relatively straightforward for the buds they ably handled the environment with a plum and I think we need to take it up a notch and take these buds to a busy London Street as you can hear a lot more going on you know the hustle bustle the crowds much louder background in and of course London traffic let's see how the two buds do here right off the bat the bows do a really good job masking all the conversations around me cars driving by are all but silent save for the highest pitch squeaks of Rusty brakes but overall the bows do a near Flawless job of silencing this busy London Street the airpods again do a great job with the din of this busy street people walking right by me talking on their phones were completely inaudible again only the faintest squeaks of brakes and idle bus engines leak through really hard to separate the two as they both perform admirably but I think the Bose edges this round handling the London streets marginally better than the airport but it is close right let's Crank It Up and pit these two buds against the underground once in full flow you'd be hard-pressed to hear anything on a tube so let's put these buds together and see how much of the tube they can silence straight away a lot of the wind noise is greatly reduced with the bows the announcer's voice only peeks through in between the lulls and the music the harder clangs of metal on metal persists but at a greatly reduced level and the alerts for when the doors open and close are completely drowned out too with the airpods it seems to do a slightly better job isolating the louder wind noises something about the music sounds cleaner and crisper which AIDS in drowning out the turbulent tube environment between the two I believe the airpods take this round well that was a really tough test for our buds but overall they performed really well under tough conditions after totting up the results the overall winner were the bows they just did a much better job with Urban environments and not to mention how they performed in this book a word test that's not to say the airpods Pro 2 didn't perform well they did great at the park and also were only narrowly defeated by the bows and the spoken word test so what do you think of our noise canceling Showdown and what buds would you like to see next time drop your thoughts in the comments below and I'll catch you on the next one [Music]
Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds 2, what you're looking at right here is a brand new pair of earbuds from bose that claims to have the best active noise cancellation in the industry these are the new bose quietcomfort earbuds too and these i would venture as far as to say are the most improved earbuds compared to their previous model which by no means was a bad model the original bose quiet comfort earbuds were for a while among the kings of active noise cancellation they sounded amazing they blocked everything out around you but these are just substantially better not only do we have a much better design with a smaller case smaller more comfortable earbuds but also a new suite of features on here and a lot we'll talk about throughout this video so i want to start off with the physical design with these for the case like i said i'm not going to make this video these versus the old quiet comforts because there's a lot different but i'm going to highlight some of the big things i really like about these you'll figure out from there which ones are the improvements but the case is so much smaller than the older version it's still by no means a tiny case so you can see like right here so this is what it looks like next to the galaxy buds 2 pro case which is a relatively small case and you can see bose still has a chunkier case but with that you're getting a pretty long battery life with active noise cancellation on you're getting six hours in the earbuds and 30 hours when you include the case on the back we have a button for pairing we've got wireless charging on these we have usb type-c on the bottom and if we open them up the earbuds themselves again have a massive redesign i was very happy to see this i'm so happy bose did this and the earbuds have let's go through them one at a time so we have the silicone ear tip on there there are three different sizes so it should fit very comfortably in your ear it's kind of an oval design some people love that some people don't like that but you can't deny that you're getting great active noise cancellation out of these so it's making a really good seal on the top then we're actually getting instead of a constant wing tip that you have to get one size for we can separately and independently choose a wing tip out of three different sizes that come in the box so it can hold differently on either ear differently from the silicone tip the ear tip so you can really customize these to fit perfectly and stay in your ears now these do have of course microphones on the inside as well as on the outside not only for calls but also for that active noise cancellation and that transparency mode there's a lot of new stuff with that that i'm going to talk about in a minute because bose was really excited about a lot of new features related to that but before we get to that one more thing i want to point out with the physical design here is that on the outside we do have not only touch pads but also swipe capabilities as well so on that stem right there we can swipe up and down and that's a great way to control the volume in a very easy and intuitive way now although these are very customizable from my experience in all honesty they're very comfortable i wear them but if i try to go for a run with them they do tend to work their way out of my left ear which for me has always been a challenge with most earbuds airpods pro included most other earbuds included it's very rare that they'll stay in my left ear and it's no exception with these unfortunately so like i said while it is very comfortable it's not perfect at staying in my ears personally now these also have ipx4 water resistance so if these do stay in your ears while you're running the good news is that sweat or a light drizzle should not damage them now let's get into the bread and butter of these earbuds the active noise cancellation and the aware mode so the transparency mode so to speak these never turn that off so you can change between 11 different levels but at no point will you turn it off the system is always running and what bose is so excited about what these do is essentially you put them in your ears they play a tone and that tone is listening with the microphones to kind of map out your ear geometry and figure out the best profile for your ears with regards to the sound but also with regards to the active noise cancellation to give you the best possible not only anc but also transparency mode and honestly it does a fantastic job when i'm using these and i have aware mode on i can hear everything around me very well it sounds very natural it's in real time doesn't sound robotic it really is a fantastic experience i find that i can easily hold a conversation with somebody or if i'm working at my desk listen to music and hear everything around me as i need to i think that's really important if you're outside and it is windy these do a decent job of kind of bringing the wind down but you do still pick up some of that wind in the microphones from my testing at least when it's at full maximum transparency mode now they do have something really cool in here that's called active sense and this allows you to essentially block out the higher decibel sound so if you're walking on the sidewalk and you have transparency mode on and then somebody drops something really loud next to you or there's a jackhammer it'll tone that back a little bit so you don't blow your ears out and that's a feature i love to see it's also something coming out on a lot of other earbuds these days like the new airpods so it's a really great future proof feature there but speaking of future proof these also do have bluetooth 5.3 i don't know why i wanted to mention that now but it seems like something that i'm very happy to see on a newer pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation then once again these do a fantastic job i will actually will test these side by side with some of the best ones out there like sony sennheiser the new airpods if you guys want to see that definitely go down and click that subscribe button but as far as these as a standalone device they're doing a fantastic job you're blocking out everything around you and while a lot of people like to only focus on the power like the raw volume of the anc i would say that there's a lot more to it there's many layers to active noise cancellation like how they interact with wind how smooth it is how much white noise you have and what different frequencies they block out and i would say that in general these are giving me among the best experiences out there where if i go outside on a windy day it doesn't pick up the wind it does a fantastic job of not picking up the wind and giving me a nice quiet experience similarly people talking are usually a tricky thing for earbuds usually earbuds do a great job of blocking out you know for example like a rumbly fridge or an air conditioner but these obviously do that as well but for voices again they're able to block a lot of voices even higher frequency voices like female voices tend to be an especially difficult thing for earbuds and these once again do a fantastic job there now a lot of that is thanks to the drivers and the microphones on here so let's actually get into a microphone test and see how it sounds when you're on a phone call by a busy road on a windy day all right so i'm out here by a really busy road it's also really breezy but as somebody talking on the phone right now i would say that i can hear my voice really well but this is doing a great job of not letting in too much sound around me like not too much wind not too much of the traffic i feel like being on a phone call with this is pretty comfortable but leave a comment and let me know how this sounds to you and how these microphones actually perform and as far as the sound quality goes with these earbuds they're being made by bose so it's no surprise they sound really good on paper the specs might not look the most promising they don't have aptx or aptx hd or ldac or any higher end codec on there they're limited to just spc and aac but all things considered when you're actually using the earbuds you wouldn't necessarily know it they really do a great job they have a very nice balance to them you're getting very powerful bass and sub bass as well that delivers clean bass lines you're able to hear all those lower frequencies and of course it doesn't get muddy or eclipse any kind of mids on there as well so vocals are crisp and detailed and very easy to hear and then the highs again you can really have some pretty decent instrument separation on here as well i do have to say i wish there was a little bit more detail in there that's something that if you listen to other premium pairs of earbuds around this price generally you're getting just a tad more detail and clarity on those but listening to these like i said a great balance and overall a nice warm profile that sounds good with most genres of music out there in addition to that i usually add a disclaimer when i talk about sound that everybody has different ear geometry but with these the goal is to get rid of that variable so that everybody puts these in their ear and it calibrates to them and you should be getting the same experience no matter who you are which of course you can still have different preferences and different genres but hopefully the ear geometry is no longer a big variable so far in this video i've been talking about a lot of positives about these earbuds right great active noise cancellation great microphones great customizable fit great sound quality but not everything's perfect with these there are some compromises that you need to be aware of and going through those the first one is that surprisingly they don't have mono mode or at least not from my experience connecting to a samsung galaxy device if i put only the right earbud in my ear while the left one is in the case it is not able to connect it actually disconnects and it turns the earbud off similarly you do not have multi-point connectivity so you can't connect to a laptop and a phone simultaneously uh you can have up to like seven different devices remembered by this so as soon as you click connect on the new device it'll switch over to that but it's not a seamless automatic connection like for example if you have music on your laptop and then you get a phone call it's not going to automatically switch over to your phone as i mentioned a few times throughout this video these are not able to turn off that engine that runs the active noise cancellation you always have either ambient mode or active noise cancellation or one of the 11 levels between them and so most people most of the time will not care about that at all so it's really not a negative but for me personally maybe i'm just kind of weird with this when i go for a run i don't want to hear like nothing i don't want full active noise cancellation but if you start going over to the ambient modes it will pick up a little bit more wind and so for me with most earbuds i'll just turn it off that's what i really like to do so it blocks out some passive stuff around me but i can hear cars i can hear things that i need to hear while i'm running and so that's really important to me and with these you're not able to do that again maybe i'm the weird one you can leave a comment below and let me know if you do anything similar to that but for me personally that's a bit of a drawback but it doesn't really matter because as i mentioned for me personally these aren't really the best earbuds for running the ear tips don't or the wing tips don't really hold it in my left ear well enough everybody has weird ears maybe mine are just weird by these standards but the good news is if you're sitting indoors or any kind of studio type you know office environment these are very comfortable great sound quality great active noise cancellation overall a really solid pair of earbuds so that's my take on the bose quietcomfort earbuds 2. not the best name but a really solid pair of earbuds and i'm really excited to compare these to other earbuds on the market if you enjoyed the video consider liking and subscribing i'm mike o'brien thanks for watching see you next time [Music]
Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds, finally bose's new 280 dollar noise canceling quietcomfort earbuds arguably the best true wireless earbuds out there for muffling sound around you i also have the new 180 sport earbuds both sound really good so let's get right into how they stack up against the competition well it's worth spending the extra hundred dollars on the quietcomfort earbuds [Music] i'm gonna mainly focus on the choir comfort earbuds because they're the flagship after all and bose is known for its noise canceling and they don't disappoint in that department as far as noise cancelling goes these are top notch you can toggle through three customizable noise canceling settings including a transparency mode that lets sound in by tapping the left earbud using the touch controls at their top setting these did a better job at muffling sound than the airpods pro and sony wf 1000x mark iii i didn't take them on a plane but i do have an air conditioning system in my apartment that's fairly loud and the bose almost completely eliminated the fan sound although sony and the airpods pro did a good job tamping down the sound the bose was better i also used them on the streets of new york city to impressive effect the quietcomfort earbuds also sound better than the airpods pro they're just richer sounding with better detail and more powerful bass that's also well defined the bose are right up there with the best sounding two wireless earbuds and go toe to toe the sennheiser momentum true wireless 2 which retails for 300 work well for a variety of music genres but fans of hip hop and edm will find they have plenty of kick to their base they're also good for making calls but maybe not quite as good as the airpods pro still they're a big improvement over boza's earlier soundsport free which only had mono sound in one bud for calls the quietcomfort earbuds effectively reduced ambient sound in the streets of new york during calls and callers so they could hear me well my voice was clear and i could hear collars really well i just wouldn't call the noise reduction stellar it isn't on the level for instance of bose's full-size noise-canceling 700 headphones a lot of people ask about this and you can use a single bud either left or right for calls or listening to music and when you pull one bud the other one automatically goes into a transparency mode so you don't have any weirdness of listening to one bud with noise cancelling on you get up to six hours of battery life on a single charge or about an hour more than the airpods pro the buds are sweat and weather resistant with a splash resistance rating of ipx4 and that's the same as the airpods [Music] pro quadcopter earbuds do have some downsides the airpods pro and popular android oriented butts like samsung's galaxy buts plus and galaxy buds live are significantly smaller and lighter and have really compact charging cases you gotta love that i did find the choir comfort earbuds comfortable to wear they use bose's new state ear max tips that have an integrated wing with the largest tip i got a tight seal and really secure fit and while they're smaller than bose's earlier sound sport free the quietcomfort buds do stick out a fair amount from your ears and if you tuck the case into the front pocket of a tight pair of jeans let's just say it leaves a noticeable bulge that said the case is smaller than the case for the beats powerbeats pro so it's not gigantic it has wireless charging capabilities and gives you an extra two charges there's also a quick charge feature that gives you two hours of battery life with a 15 minute charge i can't compare the bose to everything that's out there and some people will get on my case for talking so much about the airpods pro but they are the best selling true wireless noise cancelling earbuds and apple just added a new spatial audio virtual surround sound feature to them so they remain an attractive option for a little less than what the quietcomfort earbuds cost i do think it comes down to whether you're going to live with the bose's larger size and overall design for a lot of people the answer will be no the fact is design is important fit is important and the airpods pro are just lighter a little bit more comfortable and that means that more people are going to be willing to give up some sound quality and a little bit of noise canceling for that design but if great sound and noise cancelling is your priority the quiet comforter earbuds clearly have it it's no contest there now the other alternative is bose's cheaper sport earbuds which have the same ipx4 water resistance rating but an hour or less of battery life we've got links of where to buy both models down in the description sport earbuds don't sound quite as dynamic and their base doesn't go quite as deep as the base on the choir comfort earbuds but they're well balanced with nice detail and punchy bass overall they sound very good and also are good for making calls though maybe not quite as good as the quiet comfort earbuds well they do stick out from your ears they're smaller and lighter than quadcopter earbuds and their case is about 30 to 40 smaller though it doesn't have wireless charging [Music] i found them slightly more comfortable to wear and what you can use the quiet comfort earbuds for sporting activities i didn't have a problem running with them the sport earbuds will be better for runners simply because they are lighter if you don't need active noise cancer don't like it sensation the sport earbuds are probably the better value that said i do think a lot of people are going to be willing to spend that extra 100 simply because of the flexibility of having that noise cancelling and that little bit of extra bit of performance but the sporty buds do compete well against other earbuds in their price class and they do sound slightly better than less expensive models like the galaxy butts plus of course the butts plus are more discreet looking if you are in the market for a noise cancelling headphone i recently reviewed sony's new what mark iv a top over ear model so check out that video too it's a great headphone i'm david carney for cnet thanks for watching and let me know what you think in the comment section
Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds, hey folks these are the bose quietcomfort earbuds too in case you missed it they were announced on the same day that apple introduced the airpods pro 2 and iphone 14 and they kind of got a bit lost in the shuffle they cost 299 so definitely pricey but now that i got my hands on a pair i got to say they're really good they fit my ears really well have great noise cancelling excellent sound and improved voice calling performance we can debate at the end whether they're too expensive but before we do that let me go over what i think makes them among the top few earbuds and what i think some people may find a little lacking here we go [Music] okay so for starters you can only get them in black at launch triple black is what bose calls the color but to you and me it's black sandstone is coming later in the year personally i like the lighter color a little better but black's just fine and a lot of people prefer it more importantly not only are the earbuds about 30 smaller than their predecessors but their case is about 40 smaller and truly pocketable while the original quietcomfort earbuds featured excellent noise canceling and very good sound quality they were pretty hefty and protruded from your ears the new buds each weigh a little less than .25 ounces or seven grams according to bows still not spelt but significantly smaller the other big changes to the ear tips bose has ditched its one piece state ear wing tips for a two-piece fit kit system that features separate ear tips and stability bands in three different size options that's supposed to give users more flexibility to get a secure fit and tight seal i did like the state ear wing tips but after trying the new two-piece system i'm sold on it i ended up going with the large tips in medium stability band and that really locked the buds in my ears i can't tell you that these will fit everyone's ears equally well if you're someone who can't get a secure fit with the air pods pro 2 which are lighter and quite comfortable wear this new two-piece fit kit system may be a reason to give the bose a go over the new airpods pro a handful of new premium earbuds feature a kind of auto custom tube feature that takes into account the shape of your ears and ear canal and bose has also developed a new custom tuned sound calibration system to not only optimize noise canceling but the sound quality for your particular ears every time you place the buzz in your ears a proprietary tone is played and a microphone measures your ear canals acoustic response it takes about half a second or so but you definitely notice that the noise cancelling has undergone some optimization it's really impressive just how much the sound around you was muffled bose says it's targeted frequencies that were previously difficult to reduce in the mid and high range like the voices of nearby co-workers screaming babies and family distractions in your home office i used this in my home next to a relatively loud hvac unit and the noise cancelling basically completely silenced it was more impressed with how much sound it reduced when i walked in the streets of new york and rode the subway you can still hear people's voices but they seem to be muffled by about 60 percent it's a little startling when you take the buds out of your ears or put them into transparency mode just how much sound is being filtered out and yes that transparency mode bose calls it in aware mode it's also improved it does sound more natural and lifelike the best transparency modes like on the airpods pro make it seem as if you're not wearing earbuds and can hear the world as it would sound without earbuds in your ears these do a good job of getting you close to that sensation while the drivers appear to be the same or very similar to those found in the original quietcomfort earbuds those reps told me that thanks to the custom tune technology the sound is noticeably improved with more nuanced clarity depth and better accuracy and that's pretty much what you'll hear if you were to compare these to the originals everything is a little bit more clear and natural sounding their predecessors also had relatively big sound and by that i mean they have a pretty wide sound stage but the bass has a bit more definition and punch now and is a bit more detail and separation between instruments so you can hear them more distinctly i also thought they had just the right amount of warmth particularly with male and female vocals their tonal balance is overall very good while software and advanced algorithms play a big part in the quietcomfort earbuds performance they do feature four microphones in each but two of which are beam forming microphones to focus on picking up your voice voice calling performance was a weak point in the regional quiet comfort earbuds and boses clearly made an effort to improve it with better noise reduction and voice pick up during calls i think it's significantly better now but have a listen for yourself all right i'm in the streets of new york city i'm doing a test call right now with the earbuds i'll be blocked out by and large you sound very good to excellent when you're talking it sounds more like you're inside a big room not outside here's a tiny bit of background noise but when you're not talking you pretty much don't hear any background noise at all it's like the microphone goes dead as it should when you're not talking all right um there's a fair amount of street noise here there's a couple cars going by um i'm just talking a little bit more so that uh see what it sounds like when i'm talking okay on to battery life it's rated at six hours with noise cancelling on that's the same as the new airpods pro 2 and you get about three extra charges from the new trim down charging case which features usb-c charging but not wireless charging that seems a bit unfortunate since most earbuds in this price range including the airpods pro 2 feature wireless charging like their predecessors the quietcomfort earbuds 2 are splash proof with an ipx4 rating they also have similar touch controls with a swipe gesture for volume control that i like i thought the touch controls worked well and they are slightly customizable as for bluetooth flavors these are equipped with bluetooth 5.3 they use the aac and spc audio codecs but currently have no support for qualcomm's aptx audio codec or multi-point bluetooth pairing i was disappointed by that particularly by the lack of multi-point bluetooth pairing but there's some hope that that may change in the future that's because a bose rep told me that these earbuds are equipped with a 5 series qualcomm chip that chip supports multi-point bluetooth pairing and has app deck support so i think there's a good chance we'll see at least multi-point bluetooth pairing added in the future and perhaps other features it's worth noting that while the noise canceling is of the adaptive variety you can adjust its levels between three settings the earbuds also have adjustable equalizer settings so you can tweak the sound profile i'll finish by saying that i did compare these to some other top earbuds including sony's wf-1000x mark iv which were released in june of 2021 and lists for 20 less these bose buds have surpassed those sony buds not only in terms of sound quality noise canceling but also voice calling and fit we'll have a full comparison of the airpods pro 2 in a separate video i can't get into all the details on apple's new buds just yet but like i said if you're someone who can't get a really secure fit from the airpods pro these are a compelling alternative for a little bit more but the performance improvements to the airpods pro 2 make them a pretty safe and enticing choice for iphone users for 50 less than these that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider these if you're an ios user but the airpods pro have their own set of advantages for ios users the same can be said for samsung's excellent galaxy but 2 pro earbuds and samsung galaxy device owners those buds have certain features that only galaxy owners can take advantage of including high resolution audio over bluetooth if you have the right setup but again the quietcomfort earbuds 2 may offer a better fit for you and i do think they sound slightly better than both the galaxy butts 2 and the pixel buds pro and have better noise cancelling as i said if you can get a tight seal with these buds the noise cancelling is really impressive probably the best out there right now as always feel free to post your views in the comments section and let me know what you think about their new design and whether you think they're worth 299 dollars after what i've told you about them if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't already i'm david carnoy thanks for watching [Music]
Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds, as a food delivery driver I've been a power user of the original Bose quiet Comfort earbuds for over a year and although they debuted roughly two years ago I'm gonna go through why they're still worth it even in 2022. this review isn't going to go over Spec's Northern nitty-gritty details of the earbuds rather this is going to be more of my real world experience what I like and don't like about these so without further Ado let's get into it the earbuds itself is housed in a thick case I don't mind the chunky case because normally it just sits in the front storage area of my car you can also throw them in a backpack or purse without much fuss however if you want something pocketable these aren't the best option I mean you can have the case in your pocket if you often wear more loose fitting clothes like gym shorts or sweatpants but if you're a skinny jeans type person it'll definitely be noticeable as for the material the case and earbuds are made up of a hard plastic I actually like the material because it seems to be more durable and less prone to scuffs and scratches even when it's getting tossed around in a bag the ear tip are made up of a soft silicone and they feel surprisingly nice speaking of comfort the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds are aesthetically not the most attractive they look like very large pills my grandma used to take every morning and since they do protrude out of your ears a considerable amount you'd assume they'd hurt like hell after a short while right well you'd be wrong I believe the combination of the soft silicone and wingtip design the earbuds feel secure and I can wear them an entire battery cycle without my ears fatiguing which can range anywhere between five to six hours now are these the most comfortable Bluetooth wireless earbuds I've ever tried I'd say the airpods pro takes the championship Comfort belt to the point where I often forget they're in my ear holes however the comfortability of these both earbuds certainly isn't a negative now let's touch on battery life when the earbuds are fully charged they can last up to six hours and I can attest to this even in my use case even after using it practically day in and day out for over a year battery life has remained consistent between have five to six hour mark depending on how long I've had active noise cancellation turned on the case itself can provide an additional two full charges of extra battery life and if you slap the earbuds in the case for just 15 minutes you get two hours of play time the thick case can be charged via USBC or a Qi wireless charging pad which are both convenient options to have okay I need to preface this part by stating I'm not a psycho audio file this opinion is coming from a dude with novice ears also I admittedly haven't tried every Bluetooth wireless earbuds out there especially the Sony watchma college or the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds too but these are the best sounding Bluetooth wireless earbuds I've ever tried the active noise cancellation alone is the sole reason why they're still worth it even in 2022. for instance if I'm on the road doing deliveries for eight plus hours I'm forced to switch between either the Beats fit Pro or the airpods pro while I'm giving juice to the Bose earbuds the QuietComfort earbuds has a much richer sound and the active noise cancellation is far superior in comparison they eliminate a lot of the external noise where I don't have to max out the volume when I'm jamming out to a Spotify playlist I should also mention that I've been testing out the brand new airpods Pro 2 for the past few days and though they sound way better than the original version the active noise cancellation on the airpods Pro 2 isn't noticeably better than these that's pretty amazing considering these came out more than two years ago as for traveling I do prefer over ear headphones like my airpods Max to really drown out that crying baby sitting next to me on the plane but the quiet Comforts are a solid alternative if you prefer to travel light while still experiencing world-class active noise cancellation lastly the transparency mode they're not as good as the airpods pro where the sound coming from the outside sounds so freaking natural but at least the Bose earbuds doesn't sound like you're stuck in a Campbell's Soup can it honestly sounds like if you had a small piece of Kleenex tissue stuck in your ear when I first bought the earbuds they were crippled by the Bose app there just wasn't a lot of customizations you could do here are a few notable software improvements that were made since I purchased it though you can now adjust volume up and down by swiping on the right earbud why this wasn't a built-in feature I have no clue I also love you can refine your equalizer settings based on your listening preferences Bose also added modes where you can adjust the level of noise cancellation whether you're at the gym office or on your commute and the last thing worth mentioning is that Bose has added active sense according to Bulls the purpose of active sense is that if things get too loud the earbuds automatically adjust the amount of noise cancellation so you can enjoy your music comfortably I tried this feature out for a few days while doing food deliveries and it's not for me I mean I get why they added it you want to save your ear holes from Extremely Loud Noises in your surroundings like construction or an ambulance risen by you my biggest gripe with active sense is when I'm in transparency mode and I'm having a conversation with another human being active sense picks up voices and increases the noise cancellation level making it really difficult to hear what the other person is saying I might be a dumb dumb but doesn't this defeat the purpose of transparency mode I hope in a future software update both corrects this until then I'll just leave active sense off other than me having no use for active sense I do appreciate all of the other software updates Bose has added to make these earbuds way more versatile okay I do have to mention another nitpick touch controls call me old school but for Bluetooth wireless earbuds I prefer having some form of button I'll love the Beats fit Pro or airpods Pro unfortunately there are no buttons on the Bose quiet Comforts and it's all controlled via touch you double tap the right earbud to play Slash pause to toggle through your various noise cancellation modes you have to double tap the left earbud and lastly I customize holding down the left earbud to skip to the next track I may be in the minority but constantly tap tap tapping on my eardrum does get old after a while these earbuds are bigger than most so why couldn't Bulls add a teeny tiny button somewhere on here that would have been amazing now are these earbuds good for working out or going to the gym personally I'd say yes and no the earbuds have an ipx4 rating for water resistance this means the earbuds should be fine during sweaty workouts or in light rain however though you can use them on long runs they're a bit too big and bulky for my liking plus I don't need Superior noise cancellation on runs as I like to be more aware of my surroundings anyway I would lean more towards something smaller like the Beats fit Pro if you're going to use it primarily for extensive runs if you're just at the gym on the other hand these would be great you can have a more immersive gym going experience blocking out all the grunts and heavy breathing from the folks around you so finally are these still worth it in 2022 I mean I already spoiled the answer in the intro but at the original 279 dollar price point I don't think it is at the time of filming this however you can cop them at a reduced price from either Best Buy or Amazon for 199 at 199 I can wholeheartedly recommend them over the past year the Bull's quiet Comfort earbuds was my most used electronic device other than my iPhone although the case is chunkier than I'd like and the giant pill-shaped earbuds are admittedly not the most attractive or comfortable compared to some of the other bluetooth earbuds I've tried these minor issues are overcome by how great they sound and the fact that Bose has improved the earbuds immensely making them more usable via upgraded software so if you're in the market for a great sounding pair of Bluetooth wireless earbuds but aren't willing to Shell out the cash for the latest and greatest you certainly won't be disappointed in these well that's it for me thanks for watching like comment subscribe and I'll see you then foreign [Music]
Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds, hi i'm daigo from rainies.com today we'll be doing a review of the bose quiet comfort earbuds we'll be evaluating it on our standardized test bench to see how it performs and if you should buy it the bosque comfort earbuds are both first foray into truly wireless noise cancelling earbuds they offer a solid alternative to both this well-known over-ears qc45 with a lighter more portable design their noise canceling is great too and they come in a few sleek colors to suit your style the bose qc earbuds have a great build quality they're mostly made of plastic with silicone ear tips and fins they're also certified ipx4 for resistance against splashes of water so they can handle a walk in the park without an issue they come with three differently sized silicone ear tips to help you get the best fit the ear tips don't go too deeply in your ear which makes them comfy enough if you wear them for a long period of time the tips also have stability fins integrated into their design they're very flexible and help keep them from falling out of your ear when you're on the go however for in-ear headphones they have a bulky plastic body that sticks out of your ear each bud has a touch sensitive surface it's somewhat easy to use but it can be tricky to register a slight touch if you want to adjust the volume alongside basic calls and music controls you can also cycle between up to four different anc modes you can also select which anc mode you can access via their companion app on the downside they lack track skipping controls these headphones also come with a carrying case although it's a bit bulky it has a lock to keep the buds from falling out of it there's also a row of lights to indicate the case's battery life and a usbc port for recharging the case now let's take a look at the tests we'll start with sound for our test we use their default sound profile and smoke silicone ear tips and turn the anc to high our raw frequency response graph measures how accurately the headphones reproduce each frequency in terms of amplitude to measure frequency response we use five different measurements to account for different fits and positionings across users for in-ears earbuds like the bose qc earbuds these measurements are only done on our dummy head their design also means that there isn't much deviation in frequency response either so long as you get a good fit in comparison the sum profile curve shows the differences between the measured frequency response and our target this makes it easier to see characteristics like over emphasize space or travel this target is chosen based on research by harman to be one that most people prefer the bose have a flat sound profile that follows our target response very well mixes have a touch of extra thump rumble and boom but it doesn't overwhelm the rest of your audio their sound is suitable for a variety of audio content although some users may find vocals and lead instruments a bit bright luckily their companion app has a three band graphic eq plus presets to help you adjust their sound when you're listening to audio at high volumes there's a chance you may encounter unwanted distortion which can affect the fidelity of your sound luckily the bose have a great performance at high volumes so your audio sounds clear and pure as we come to expect from other bose headphones like the qc35 or 45 they have great noise isolation performance thanks to their active noise cancelling system each mode delivers a different amount of noise isolation their highest setting is quiet mode whether you're commuting to work or traveling by jet they do an excellent job at cutting down bass range noise such as engine rumbles they're also able to reduce ambient chatter well so you can focus on your audio rather than the office chatter they do a great job at isolating you from high pitched noise like the hum of an ac unit if you like to listen to audio at high volumes you may not want others around you to hear it luckily most of the leakage is concentrated in the treble range and escaping audio sound is thin it also falls below the noise floor of an average office so you don't need to worry about bothering co-workers or passengers if you are cranking up your favorite tunes the bose qc earbuds have an integrated mic since it sits far away from your mouth the mic has just an okay recording quality your voice sounds bright but it's a little staticky and unnatural noise handling is how well the mic separates your voice from background noises the mic has an always on noise gate which automatically cuts down ambient noise when you're not talking while you should have no problem being heard clearly if you're calling from a quiet space the mic has a lot of trouble separating your voice from moderate ambient noise if you're making a call from a busy street your voice may be drowned out the bose qc earbuds have a decent battery performance they're advertised to last roughly six hours continuously and we measured slightly over than that while it may not be enough to get you through your nine to five working day without pausing or recharging them again their carrying case holds two additional charges this brings their total battery life to just under 22 hours you can also just use one bud while the other one charges but the procedure is a little bit tricky at first if you're charging the left bud the case lid needs to be closed if you're charging the right bud the lid must be open however battery life can vary depending on your usage these buds are compatible with the bose music app on ios and android devices this app is a successor to the bose connect app and it offers new features like the 3-band graphic eq plus presets that you can use to customize their sound you can check the battery life adjust the volume level and remap controls there's also a self-voice feedback feature it allows you to hear your voice during a call unlike the bose qc35 the qc earbuds don't support multi-device pairing so you won't be able to connect to your laptop and smartphone at the same time they also don't support nfc pairing for quick pairing with nfc enabled devices if you like to stream videos or game via bluetooth you'll want to take latency into account its measured of delay and high value can indicate that your audio and visuals will be out of sync they have somewhat of a high latency on pc resulting in delay between your audio and visuals however their latency on ios and android devices is much slower so audio lag shouldn't be an issue if you're streaming videos keep in mind that some apps and devices compensate for latency differently though so this brings us to the main question should you buy these earbuds if you commute a lot to work and if you travel a lot these earbuds can be a great choice their anc helps cut down background noise while their portable design makes it easy to store away when not in use that said if you're looking for even more noise isolation the bose quiet comfort 45s and sony wh-1000xm4s are a solid choice if you don't mind an over ear fit while both headphones are much bulkier than the bose qc earbuds by design they have significantly better noise isolation performance they also have a longer continuous battery life so you don't need to charge them to make it through a long flight you may also prefer the sony's over the bose qc45s if you want customization features unlike the sony the qc45s don't have graphic eqs or presets to adjust their sound if you prefer an in-ear fit and you're a diehard apple fan check out the apple airpods pro their design offer a unique benefit to ios users such as the h1 chip for seamless pairing with your apple devices they also support spatial audio a feature which can help improve the immersiveness of your audio if the price of the bose or the apple is too steep then you should check out the anker soundcore live p3 truly wireless these wallet-friendly in-ears have an anc system with modes that you can select to best suit the noise around you they're also less bulky than the bose and have more comfortable fit however their continuous battery life is much shorter so you may need to recharge them to last through a long flight [Music]
Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds, this is the latest Flagship pair of earbuds from Bose and the name says it all these are the quiet Comfort Ultra earbud which is a pretty bold claim I know but honestly I would love to have a pair of ultra comfortable earbuds with ultra quiet AMC when I travel when I work or really whatever so let's unpack that starting off with the Quiet part spoiler ultra quiet is not an exaggeration but before we get into the test I'm actually filming this before these earbuds hit the shelves so I want to thank Bose for sending these over early and for partnering in this video of course all opinions are my own and we'll keep things objective and factual with real testing throughout this video so starting off with the active noise cancellation test the way I do this is by playing the sound of a jet at a set distance away and I turn that volume up until the earbuds are no longer able to block that out so higher number means quieter earbuds and as you can see in this chart these are the quietest earbuds I've ever tested blocking up to 65.2 decibels which was absolutely incredible I've also tried this in real world so situations flying with this other loud Ambient sound and it blocks everything so so well but of course noise cancellation is not one dimensional we also need to think about higher pitch sounds and crowd sounds and and different noises and so I ran those tests I'll show them on screen right here as well in general across the board very very impressive but without a doubt the bread and butter of these earbuds is going to be those constant loud noises like a jet a train an air conditioner whatever it's going to be very quiet from that aspect with these earbuds the second test I did was with regards to the wind a lot of earbuds struggle when you're outside and it's windy the microphones kind of feed that back in the ANC but with these I mean I was actually very impressed now you can't turn the ANC off it's always on on some spectrum between a and c and transparency and I'll show you that in the app in a second but the mic overall did a really impressive job of really shutting down the wind and I think the microphone test in just a few minutes will demonstrate that as well so as I I said I like to use these when I'm traveling and ANC is fantastic but all of that is completely worthless if they aren't comfortable so being that these are called The Quiet Comfort we better hope they are comfortable and let's unpack that a little bit so everybody has different ears but Bose understands that we have three pairs of ear tips and three pairs of wing tips giving you nine different like a permutation of nine I believe nine different setups you could have there so for me I was actually of a full disclosure last time we had the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds too the Second Generation generation from last year they were comfortable but they didn't stay in my ears well like I really couldn't wear them for a long period of time and I don't know exactly what bows changed here but these are definitely a lot better they feel more comfortable than the twos they stay in my ears for a longer period of time without falling out without getting uncomfortable um and so I was happy to see that so so far quiet Comfort is is a pretty fitting name but of course we have a few more things we have to test you can't just have quiet and comfortable earbuds obviously the sound is going to matter a lot and so these once again took it a step further than the previous generation these are Snapdragon sound certified which means one of my biggest complaints from the twos was that they only had SBC and AAC codecs this now has Qualcomm appdx adaptive which means you're getting lower latency so like less lag in the earbuds and you're getting higher resolution sound no not every phone has aptx adaptive my pixel fold didn't but my nothing phone 2 did so I was using that and the sound quality especially when you have aptx adaptive on was actually really nice like I really was impressed by the sound profile on these there was plenty capable bass and sub bass having pretty large drivers in here it's also a warm and pleasant sound it's a definitely a lot more detailed than the previous generation it can be a bit boomy by default so I use the EQ in the app which definitely helped with that and for many genres like the boomy sound would be ideal anyway but for what I was listening to I wanted to dial that back and the EQ really allowed me to do that so for example I listened to the War on Drugs just to kind of test it out it's they have a lot of music that has a lot of layers and just tons of stuff going on and the Ultras kept up they made it feel like I was pretty much there as Dynamic it was Lively so following that thread of traveling you obviously need a better battery life to last the whole flight like here in the US any flight across the country is is probably about six hours or less so I think that's really a threshold of what I would need and these hit that Target with up to six hours in the earbuds and 24 hours when you include the case and that is with active noise cancellation on a lot of earbuds present their numbers with ANC off but that's not the case with Bose but they do actually have a shorter battery life if you turn on immersion you get four hours in the earbuds and 16 when you include the case when you have immersion on which I realize I haven't actually introduced that that's one of the big new features this could really be useful in like a workday so if we're shifting gears out of travel mode into like how well do these perform when you're like working at your desk so immersion is going to be better for like videos or music and it kind of gives you like a spatial 3D surround sound so the music's gonna play like right in front of you and as you turn like it'll sound like it stays right there it's something that is new to Bose and it's actually very impressive they did a great job with this it's a feature that I don't personally use all that often but I know a lot of people really like this especially for watching videos and things like that you can actually set up different modes for different situations by the way in the Bose app so the defaults include quiet which is just plain block everything out don't turn on immersion that's the one I usually use especially when I'm traveling gives you a decent battery life of six hours and you're blocking out a lot of sound around you the second mode is immersive which by default they have it as ANC and they have like the the immersion mode where you can track your head and the third one is where when you can just hear things around you some people call it transparency some people call it here through pass-through whatever and again I was actually genuinely really impressed by this so I don't know of a good way to quantify this but when you're wearing these it really feels and sounds like you don't have anything in your ears which is really tough to do besides these the airpods are the only one that can do anything like this most other earbuds on the market just sound kind of robotic or further away or quieter these like I could walk around I could talk to people I can do daily tasks and it sounds like I'm not wearing earbuds at all and let's be honest when you're working at home like I'll wear whatever I don't care what I look like but when I'm in the office you need earbuds that look good so you can leave a comment and let me know what you think of these earbuds but in general they're a similar size and shape and overall design to the the previous generation the twos but we do have two colors available and we have a new metallic finish on the outside that looks really clean and and honestly pretty premium so let me know what you think of the Aesthetics of these overall I think look pretty good we have a very familiar case here charging by USB type-c or wireless charging it's very open design on the inside so it's easy to clean which I found beneficial and getting back to kind of the workday setup another thing is is getting on phone calls so let's actually get into a microphone test all right so the first microphone test for indoors obviously in my studio I always like to do one in acquired environment to simulate maybe where you'd be on a work call so this is what it would sound like leave a comment and let me know how this sounds to you and now let's go outside to a louder environment we can test out the wind like I said as well as some other more Ambient sound all right so here's a microphone class near a road it's pretty Breezy out here there's definitely some traffic behind me so leave a comment and let me know how these sound to you so as you can tell these are pretty ideal for a workday and they check basically every box I had except one but Bose thought about this and they have their own work around here so these don't have a true multi-point connectivity I mean meaning you can connect to multiple devices but not simultaneously and the work around here is in the Bose app you can actually go to source and you can switch between many different devices by toggling them on and off and just switching between which devices are connected to the earbuds and while we're actually in the Apple I'll show you the other things Bose has here so one the volume controls of course are available in the app we also have source as I showed you we have immersive audio you can choose if you want that to be off if you want it to be a single point in front of you or if you want motion meaning like as you turn if you're facing this way it'll kind of slowly come over there and it's always feeling like it's kind of in front of you we also have a shortcut so you can choose what the the touch and hold on either side is so it can cycle through the modes it can change immersive on and off or you could access your voice assistant of course we have a three band equalizer and then we have modes now let's actually make a new mode right now this is a really cool feature probably the one that I use the most in the app so if we go to modes there's a lot of different suggested titles you can make a custom on if you wanted but let's just say we wanted a run so if we tap on run you can choose the noise cancellation so right now it's in the middle that's equivalent to having ANC off although the engine never really turns off so that's what's cool about Bose it's always running no matter what so we can go all the way down on noise cancellation and it's just like full transparency I hear my surroundings or you can turn it all the way up and it's like I feel like I'm yelling now I really can't hear anything let's go back down and then you can also choose what the immersive audio thing is so maybe when I'm working out I want to block out a little bit of sound but I want to be able to hear like if a car beeps at me or something so maybe I'll keep it around like level two or level three that might be ideal and we can save that we could say done and now we have that mode ready to go whenever we go for a run we just tap that and those settings are ready to go now speaking of working out these also have ipx4 water resistance they also have Bluetooth 5.3 so if you're in a gym the range should be relay deal it also means they work independently without the classic Master Slave connection that we used to have in the previous generation so I could listen to Just One earbud while the other one is in the case in addition these have in-ear detection so if you take an earbud out it'll automatically pause and the touch controls as I said before work really well you have a nice large surface area not only the tap but also to swipe so you can control the volume now these are starting at 299 dollars I'll have a link down below so you can check the latest price and on that link you can actually find some other accessories which I think is really cool that Bose sells these you can buy just the case so if you lost the case or if you wanted a second case uh whatever you can buy just the case you can also buy other sizes for the ear tips so if these three for the wingtip and three for the ear tip don't fit you for some reason I think they should fit I think they should fit like 95 percent of people but if you're a like an extreme outlier you could buy some of the other sizes or you can actually buy a case cover as well so again thanks to Bose for partnering on this video I'm really stoked about these earbuds and I'm definitely going to be comparing them to the Sony xm5s the latest airpods Pro and all the other Flagship earbuds out there to see which one is really the best of the best if you want to see

Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds," The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are a 
frustrating product. They have a great,   comfortable design and some of the best noise 
cancellation I've ever experienced in a set   of earbuds. Unfortunately, though, they do 
come with quite a few downsides. But first,   let's talk about the good things about these buds. These buds are extremely comfortable. Bose gives 
you a bunch of what they call stability bands to   place around the earbuds. This allows you 
to get the most comfortable and stable fit.   There's a bit of a learning curve to getting them 
placed correctly on the buds. But once you figure   it out and put them in your ears, you'll 
likely find them to be quite comfortable. Now, before switching to these buds for 
six months, the buds I had been wearing   were the Sony WF-1000XM4s, which I've 
also reviewed. And in terms of comfort,   especially when you're wearing buds for hours on 
end, I found that the Bose buds are considerably   more comfortable. The Bose buds go less 
deep into your ear than the Sony ones. I can wear these Bose buds for hours on end. 
When I do, I find that they sound pretty good.   They're not as good as the Sony WF-1000XM4s, 
but I think you get a little bit more detail   in the music you listen to. And when I first 
got these, I did think their bass was a bit   much. But thankfully, they give you an EQ 
setting in the Bose app to make adjustments. With my adjustments, I was able to more 
closely match the sound profile I'm used   to with my Sony buds. Now, part of what makes 
any modern-day buds sound good to me is noise   cancellation. It's canceling out all of the 
ambient noise around you, allowing you to hear   a wider range of frequencies that aren't 
being drowned out by some external noise. And let me tell you, if you want the best noise 
cancellation, put in a set of buds today. I   think these buds are probably it. Their noise 
cancellation is very impressive. Especially if   you just go out for a walk in a city where there's 
a lot of noise, it just cuts everything out. Unfortunately, there are some annoyances that 
I've found with these buds. During exercise,   I'll find my buds will rotate slightly, just 
enough for them to let in more outside noise.   So every once in a while, I have to rotate them 
back in, so they slide a little bit more into my   ears. I know that when they're in there a little 
bit more, the noise cancellation gets better. Now, this could just be because I picked the wrong 
stability bands for these buds. But these were the   ones that seemed like they would fit the best. 
Now, another annoyance I've found with the noise   cancellation on these buds is that they don't 
do a great job of masking either high-pitched   noises or just really loud noises. Especially when 
I'm doing something like pounding out chicken. I've got to take these buds out because 
they'll just let in this clipping noise   or something every time the mallet hits 
the chicken. And this is not something   I've experienced with other audio devices 
like the AirPods Max or my Sony WF-1000XM4   buds. Another thing that's pretty good 
with these buds is transparency mode. I've actually got it enabled 
right now, and overall,   my voice sounds clear. I think this is 
one of the better transparency modes. It sounds a little distant, and it doesn't 
sound like I'm wearing earbuds. The AirPods Max   still have the best transparency mode, where it 
doesn't even sound like you're wearing headphones. Another great feature of these buds 
is their touch controls. Overall,   they've worked great. They not only 
let you play, pause, skip forward,   and skip back like you would expect with a pair 
of earbuds, but they also let you adjust their   volume by just swiping up and swiping down, 
which is a rarity in the world of earbuds. Another standout feature that Bose did a good job 
with is the setup experience with the Bose app.   Bose gives you clear instructions with animations 
to walk you through the product. Apart from the   initial setup and the EQ adjustments, I don't 
really go into the Bose app all that often,   except for making sure that the firmware on the 
buds has been updated and troubleshooting issues. Next, let's talk about battery life. Overall, 
it's been great. The buds are rated for six   hours of playback on a charge, and the case holds 
a further four charges, for a total of 24 hours   of playback. Just 20 minutes of charging 
will net you up to two hours of playback. So that's everything I've liked about 
these buds over the past six months. Now, let's talk about downsides. 
Unfortunately, with these buds,   there are quite a few. I guess that is the benefit 
of having a six-month review period. And if you   like the fact that we do reviews only after six 
months, make sure you subscribe to the channel. The first and most annoying downside I've 
run into with these buds is that sometimes   they'll just refuse to connect to my phone. 
To remedy this issue, I'll have to go back   into the Bluetooth settings on my iPhone, or in 
the Bose app, and manually connect to the buds. Another annoying issue I've run into 
with these buds are audio cutouts. This   typically happens when I'm out on a walk 
and I've got my phone in my pants pocket   with the case in my other pocket. I'll just 
get cutouts with whatever I'm listening to. Another annoyance I've had with 
these buds is that when I first   put them in and I'm getting ready 
to listen to a podcast or something,   I'm unable to trigger it by just long pressing 
the left earbud. The only way I've been able   to solve this issue is to take the buds 
back out and then put them back in again. Another downside I've encountered 
is that when I'm wearing the buds   and pick up a call on my phone, my 
iPhone won't automatically switch   the call over to my buds. I have to 
do it manually almost every time,   which is incredibly annoying. And it's something 
I haven't experienced as much with other buds. Another downside I've found with the buds is 
the microphone quality. It's just okay. Here's a   comparison of the microphone quality of the 
Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (QC2s) to the standard   second-generation AirPods, the Sony WF-1000XM4, 
the Pixel Buds Pro, and the Galaxy Buds Pro. As you can hear, the microphone quality of the   QC2s is just okay. It's not terrible, but 
it's not great either. I get the feedback   that people can't hear me very well, especially 
when there's traffic or other background noise. Oddly, Bose doesn't seem to use the tips 
of these earbuds for microphone placement,   like Apple does with their iconic stem design. I 
think this is certainly an odd choice. Typically,   the closer you can get a microphone to somebody's 
mouth, the better the overall vocal quality is   going to be. So I'm not exactly sure why Bose 
didn't take advantage of that in their design. Now, before we get to recommendations, 
there are a few more slides. One downside I need to cover first is the case. 
It's a bit big for my taste, and I think Bose   could do some work here to try and slim it down 
for their next-gen buds. Also, the case doesn't   support wireless charging, which for buds that 
cost close to $300 USD is a bit of a letdown. Given the high cost of these buds and the amount 
of downsides and issues I've had with them over   the past six months, unfortunately, I just 
can't recommend spending the money on them. which really sucks because the noise cancellation 
solution on these is pretty much best in class. I'll continue to check in on these buds 
after this review. If anything changes,   I'll leave that in a review follow-up in 
our free monthly newsletter, and if you   haven't done so already, I'll leave a link to 
sign up for it in the description below. If   you're in the market for a premium set of true 
wireless earbuds, Sony is rumored to be coming   out with their next generation of earbuds 
that will be comparable to this Bose set. And from the leaks I've seen, they should improve 
on their comfort. Or if you're an Apple user,   of course, looking at the AirPods Pro 
makes sense. And right now you can get   these Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds on sale for a 
hundred dollars off at the time of recording,   which I pointed out in our free monthly newsletter 
where I'll sometimes post deal alerts as well. If you want to learn more about these

Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds," - Bose, quiet comfort earphones truly wireless little dynamites from Bose. Here's a product that should
have come out two years ago. You would have thought that
Bose would have been first to market with active noise canceling, truly wireless earbuds, but they weren't. I think Sony was. And actually that's you go
to expect them to do it too but this is a quite a long time coming. You would have expected Bose
to have followed earlier. I haven't used these yet. I know sometimes I sneak my unboxings with ear phones and headphones and I actually listened to
them before the episode. But with this I didn't,
this is a sealed box. So let's make that not true. Yeah. Oh, simple box. Oh, okay. I thought I had a hinge. I liked the presentation, simple. Not a tiny case. Oh my God. Do I have to actually press this button? Oh, that's okay. I mean, it's going to keep
it closed in your bag better I guess. This is kind of a chunk and I already looked at the
battery specs of this thing. You get six hours of playback
on the earbuds themselves and then an additional two charges or 12 hours from the case. And that's not a lot, really
for the size of this case. This is not a case that I want
to carry around in my pocket but I can chuck it in my bag and then I'll be able to do that safely because it has this little button. You can see there's a
battery life indicator. It looks like I got three
out of five dots right now. But before I open that up and
look at the buds themselves let's go through the rest of the box. Little presentation stand. That looks like there's
a quick start guide here. Explains the fit, explains the controls, has a bunch of Finish language
stuff I don't care about. Yeah. That's about it. Safety instructions. Really? What a waste of paper. Thanks regulations. No one's reading this crap ever, ever reading that. And then we've got charging
cable USB type C to type A. The C end goes into this
port on your charge case. No wall work pretty typical. This is like 10 inches long or something. And then we've got two
different types of sleeves here. These look like different
sizes of the exterior sleeves. This is the part of the sleeve that, actually it's all integrated. This is the left. Part of it is the silicone ear tip that'll go in your ear canal
to try to create a tight seal for base response and passive isolation. And then you've got the
kind of wing tip here, that's going to go in this part of the ear just to keep it all in place so there's three points
of contact on the sleeve. And that appears to be it, hold on secret compartment. Oh, there's a treasure in there. What does this say? I can't read what that says. I'm just gonna eat it. Mindfreak. All right. Let's check
out the initial setup using my Pixel 4. Some earbuds have the pairing
button on the charge case instead of the earbuds themselves and that's what I prefer. And yes, inside this glossy box there is a button with a
Bluetooth logo beside it. Here's the buds themselves. Glossy just looks kind of
cheap to me, but whatever. Let's try to see how do these work downward and twist. Oh wow. I enjoyed that. They played like a welcome sound. Kind of like a THX, like
this big rising treble and then the big boom like drop the bass and it
sounded really lifelike. And then it said connected. So that's pretty cool. This has like a soft touch
rubber lid, which is nice. I guess that's just really gentle and maybe it would stop a vibrating noise if these were rattling around. Just go to my Bluetooth settings here and before I they're right there. Wow. As easy as it's supposed to be. That's great. I'll press this pair button right after this message from our sponsor. Blinkist takes the best insights and most important information from thousands of non-fiction books and condenses it into 15 minutes. You can either read or listen from the app and you'll be surprised
at how much you can learn in just 15 minutes. And the app offers offline downloads which are perfect for
traveling or commuting so you don't use your data. Some of their most popular
titles include 'The AI Economy' a book that discusses the rise
of artificial intelligence and how that's going to affect our jobs, investment and lifestyle. Also 'What To Do When
Machines Do Everything'. That one explains how
automation can be incorporated into current business models and what to expect as a whole when industries adopt a
new wave of automation. Blinkist is available
in the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store of course and the first 100 people to go to blinkist.com/short-circuit are going to get unlimited
access for one week so you can try it out and then after that 25% off. Also now they have full
length audio books, premium subscribers get special pricing up to 65% off the retail price. Wow. Check it out Blinkist right now. Okay. So they're paired it's telling me right
in my settings screen that I have 90% battery, which is cool. If I hit the settings, these days they pack a lot of features just right into the Android settings menu. These earbuds in particular,
there's not a lot here. You can turn on and off HD audio, toggle whether or not phone
calls are allowed on them, media, audio and contact
sharing, which I will keep off. Even though this does
support the Google assistant so you can respond to your
text messages by voice and it'll type it out and
send the messages for you without having to open your phone. So if I did plan to keep these and I wasn't just at work right now, working for the man. Then yeah, I probably would, I would do that. Oh, let's see if we can
use Google play music for another couple of weeks before it's like officially dead. Not now YouTube music. Oh, I love this track. Totally underrated tool song
reflection from ladder Alice comes near the end almost
completely instrumental. Now is AC, is A&C on right now? These sound pretty good, but I'm going to open up the companion app and see how to use these things here. Cause they're touch. That didn't pause it. Swipe, okay. I think I paused it with a swipe. Use the touch surface
to control your earbuds view product tips in the app
to learn about touch controls. Ah, I've got a sign up. I need an account. Continue with Facebook. What does this an Oculus Quest 2. Allow notifications. The only option is got it. There's no, yes or no. No. You don't need access to location. What. If not enabled the app cannot
discover your Bose product. Oh my God. Only this one time. Thank you, Android for exposing
detailed location controls. Double tap the right ear
but to play or pause audio. So the swipe I did earlier it must've just been like an incorrect. Alright double tap. Double tap to pause and play. That's kind of a waste of an interaction. Cause usually it's just one but I guess it keeps false
positives for happening so much. Maybe like maybe I can
change that later though. Use a shortcut touch
and hold the left earbud to skip a track, so it's a hold, or check the battery level. You can decide. You can customize your
shortcut and settings. Oh, that's a bad sign to me. Like I can't just bind any
action to any interaction I have to like, with this
interaction there's two options. I don't like that. Okay. So noise cancellation's
fully on right now. Okay and I have a bar here. I can turn it up and down. That's cool. And I haven't had that
on like say like QC 25's. It's just a toggle. It's either all on or all off. But I feel like active noise
canceling and transparency is more important on a device like this, where I'm going to be walking around. I might be at the office. I might be in the elevator and a colleague is trying to talk to me and they're not going to do
that with big headphones on, but this is nice. And if you put all the way down now, now it sounds like to me like the mic's are actually picking up my voice and reinforcing it into my ear. So it's actually less isolation than just the passive isolation. And I believe I can do
that on the headset itself. So let's find out how that's done. Settings. Okay control. In ear detection. Auto play and pause. Let's try see how quick
the auto play and pause is. I've been generally disappointed with the latency on other headphones, particularly like the OnePlus
ones were pretty bad for that. I think the Sony ones, those like working out Sony ones I covered were pretty bad for that. So let's see how good it is. Pretty much similar. I think it's just a Bluetooth limitation because on their website it
says like it's instantaneous. It just pauses as soon
as these advanced sensors detect that you moved it. Like micro sensors are so crap like that. I would expect that to pause like here. Pause. Like, yeah. It's a little awkward. Not a deal breaker. And it seems like that's
just the standard, so okay. Auto answer call. Yep. Don't leave that on. That sounds annoying. Auto transparency. Noise cancellation changes to level zero when you're only wearing one earbud. That's a nice option to have. Some people just rock one
earbud all the time though. So they would have want that off. But personally that annoys me. I hate thinking that one of
my ears is gonna wear out sooner than my other one. Like, you know how like
your ears are kind of like like an ocean crashing on a rock cliff and over time your ability to hear just gets eroded. I don't want that to happen
more to one year than the other. So I just can't have one in. Shortcuts. Touch and hold left ear
bud to use your shortcut. Oh. So you can make your shortcut bound to hear battery level. Battery 80%, or skip to the next track. Oh, that is not a good sign. That's it for controls? Like what the hell is going on in here? Double click is pause. It just keeps going
quiet for a second like. So okay, double tap is pause on the right. Double tap on the left. Oh, I think double tap is toggling through the different levels of noise cancellation. Yeah. So you can see right here. I'm full now, I double tap. Boom I'm at half. I double tap, it's gone. Okay. So it's made three tiers by default. You can access by double tapping. Okay. And what if I hold on the left? All right I already did that, that's my shortcut. What if I hold on the right? Hello Google assistant, what's up? If these are touch then can't
I swipe for next and previous? Why? I'm so, so disappointed. I'm like Kevin Sorbo levels
of disappointed right now. Disappointed. Why you gave us touch controls. Why can't I like customize
what the actions do? Why can't I swipe for next and back? That's like so intuitive. Why can't I swipe for
volume up and volume down? I don't even have the option. So under utilized. I could throw this right now. Before I get like really
rage quit on these let me just listen to them a little more. I'm critically listening don't look at me. Don't. How loud are these. So noise canceling off. They're still pretty isolating with the noise canceling off. These go loud. Oh, it's hurting me now. Geez. Yeah okay they go plenty loud and they don't sound
great when they're maxed, that's for sure. That was like harsh. But the base is nice and low. I know a lot of people
don't listen to metal, but I always like to
test headphones with it because it is a good test of the highs because guitars that are loud they just sound like crap
on crappy headphones. So let's use, BYOB is a good one. I like BYOB cause it gets to the point like pretty quick in the intro here. Got to do the fit test. ♪ Lies from the tablecloth. ♪ All right. The fact that I
started having a lot of fun there they're good. They're pretty damn good. But I still can't really recommend them because they cost $280. These are 280 US dollars and they're not perfect
which is why that's too much especially in light of the competition. Which is like the Sony WF-1000XM3
are now only 170 bucks. And they're not alone at that price level. That's where you find the
pixel buds, the new ones they're are 180 bucks. That's where you find
the galaxy buds live. They're also like 170. AirPods pros are like 330. So they're 50 bucks
cheaper than AirPods pro. So I guess Bose feels
pretty happy about that. But honestly, these are pretty comparable to those XM3's from Sony, which have a smaller and
more premium looking case. Like they're way more bougie and I would feel like way more
like when I pull them out. Like yeah, check out my XM3's. Like they're sweet. They have like two tone black and copper. These don't look that cool. Like no one who like wants AirPods is going to see you with these and be like whoa I screwed
up by getting AirPods even though these sound way better. They like, they don't look that cool. They're kind of like big beans, I'm kind of disappointed with that. I was hoping they'd be a
little smaller than the XM3's, they're not. They do sound awesome but the fact that they
screwed up the interface so royally. I'll give them this. They can probably adjust it in software. They could probably do an
update and give me more controls and they should Bose. You should. Oh, you made such a good product, you're just devaluing it. Anyway if they fix that and if the price comes
down by a hundred bucks, like, so they're competitive
with that other price tier, then these will probably
fly off the shelves and then I'll recommend them cause they sound awesome. And they're going to
have like market leading noise cancellation as well. But until then, I just think they kind of
botched it a little bit. And this case is just
kind of big and clunky. They need to get a lot cheaper. That's all there is to it. Okay. A couple of things before
we go that I didn't mention you can charge this wirelessly it's a wireless charging case. If you have the correct
phone, like a Pixel five you could even just put it on there. You get power that way. That's kind of cool. They also apply active noise
canceling to the microphone from the right earbud. So I think you'll have to take
calls from the right ear bud but your voice should sound more clear cause they'll take out
some noise around you. As long as it's like predictable noise. And finally they have
volume optimized active EQ. So what this does is it makes
the base still sound present when you're at low volumes. And the reason this is a thing is because our ears don't
hear all frequencies equally. We are more attuned to the
mid and mid high range, like where human voices live. And we don't hear the high frequencies or the very low frequencies linearly. So when they master a track at
like what's reference volume which is about 85 decibels
and it's pretty loud, the base compared to the voice is going to be at a nice proportion. But when you turn down
from reference volume you're going down the frequency
response of the human ear to places where we don't hear bass as clearly as we hear voice and suddenly you're listening to music and all you hear is the mids and highs and you don't hear the bass anymore. So at low volumes you're
going to feel like you're there's no base to your music. So what they do is they have algorithm where they account for that roll off so they boost the base up
as you turn the volume down kind of keeping it
consistent across volumes. So that's what that is. And that's appreciated. It's a feature that find in lots of AVRs like from Marantz and Denon
and stuff like that as well. It's usually called dynamic EQ. But yeah, appreciated here. So yeah, I don't hate the product. I just kind of hate the implementation and the price right now. But if you don't care about
that and you're a Bose fan. Great Christmas, great gift why not hey. IPEX4 production pretty typical, you can sweat on them they'll be fine. So thanks for watching

a great weekend, really. I don't even know you but, I wish every human on earth
would have a great weekend."
Beats Fit Pro Earbuds, hey there so we got the airpods third generation last week but it turns out apple wasn't done for this year it owns beats and these are the new beats fit pro noise cancelling earbuds they're 200 come in four color options and they might just be better than the airpods pro and the sports airpods you've always wanted let's talk about that [Music] [Music] now the concept behind the fitzpro is pretty simple take beats iconic powerbeats pro sports buzz with its big ear hook and shrink it the hell down i can't say i ever love the powerbeats pro's design but a lot of people do because the earhook gives you a feeling of security that your buds aren't going to fall off your head i personally prefer my sports buds to have a wingtip that fits into the inside of the ear not around the outside of it and that's what we have here most of the time those wingtips or sports fins as they're sometimes called are removable and sometimes come in different sizes but what's interesting with the fit pro is that the wing tip has been integrated into the design it's one size fits all you can't replace it as far as i can tell but it does seem durable and it's made of firm but pliable silicone rubber it's soft to the touch the buds fit comfortably and securely in my ears i much prefer this design to the powerbeats pros beats earbuds have always had a physical control button which i do like and the fit pros also have one what's nice about it is that because it's an extension of the sport fin it is a soft to the touch finish and a little bit of a grip to it use it to control music playback answer and end calls and a long press switches between noise canceling and transparency modes you can also program the long press to be volume controls on the buds themselves that's a feature a lot of people have been asking for on the airpods and i do suspect it is coming very soon to the new airpods 3 and airpods pro these also have always on hey siri so you can raise and lower volume by just asking apple's voice assistant to do it and issuing other voice commands without touching a button anyway they're lightweight weighing 5.6 grams each and they fit my ears really well as i said they come in four colors and you'll see everything but the white version of this video i wore the lavender one around more because it shows up better in shots but i'd personally probably go with the gray color because i'm not a flashy guy and it kind of blends with your ears the best i'm a little surprised beats didn't go with red for launch but i'm sure you'll see more colors next year before i get into features and performance i just have a few more comments about the design the one big complaint about the powerbeats pro is their huge case the case for the fit pro isn't as small as the airpods pro case or even the beats studio buds case but it's still pretty compact and much smaller in the powerbeats pros case in a bit of a nod to android users the case charges via usbc not lightning however it's missing the wireless charging found in the airpods pro and airpods 3 cases [Music] battery life is rated at up to six hours with noise canceling on and seven hours with it off at moderate volume levels that's compared to around 4.5 hours for the airpods pro with noise canceling on and five hours with it off you can get an extra 21 hours of juice when the case is fully charged aside from the lack of wireless charging in all other respects the fit pro have the same features as the airpods pro one of the big downsides of the beats studio buds is that they don't have apple's h1 chip so they're missing things like adaptive eq that detects how the earbuds are sitting in your ears and optimizes sound on the fly along with those extra features for apple users like spatial audio and auto switching between devices on your icloud account but these have the h1 chip so you're getting an airpods pro-like experience with better sound and noise cancelling than the beats studio buds as well as a top-notch transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world in a natural way as far as i can tell the noise cancelling and transparency are at the same level as the airpods pro noise canceling isn't quite as good as sony's or boses but it's pretty close and quite effective at muffling external noise i will say this these actually sound slightly better than the airpods pro beats says they have custom 9.5 millimeter drivers and i think they have a touch more clarity and the base packs a little more punching goes a little deeper they have a pretty wide sound stage but they don't offer quite as expansive or refined sound as the more expensive sony wf-1000x mark iv buds i'm not talking about a big difference in sound quality sony just sounds slightly more natural has a touch more detail that can bring out a little bit more nuance in music tracks but i think the beats sound will impress you a lot it's good and these avoid distorting at higher volumes which probably has as much to do with the adaptive eq as the drivers themselves of course just how good a noise ice clinging earbud sounds is depending on how good a fit you get i'll just point out that i got a decent seal with the largest size of the included tips but i ended up switching them out for my go-to sennheiser tips that tend to fit my ears best with a lot of earbuds including the sony's now starting to get a little wonkier but some companies include tips with a slightly recessed tube that's the part that attaches to the earbuds post but the sennheiser's tube is flush with the outer rim of the tip so once you put it on the post the tip extends out from the bud a few millimeters more those few millimeters and the shape of the sennheiser tips created a perfect seal in my ears with these earbuds to be clear the beats tips fit my ears well and they should fit most people's ears well but i'm looking for the perfect fit when i test bud so i can get the optimal performance for sound quality as well as noise cancelling which can suffer if you don't get a tight seal i can't tell you how boring your tips are they can make or break an earbud and i just wanted to put in a video how subtle design difference can make an impact but it's nice that unlike with the airpods pro which have a custom tip design that you can basically swap in any tips with these like the airpods pro these beats have ear detection sensors and enhanced find my feature with proximity view that helps locate your buds in all those places they like to hide i'm not going to talk much about apple's new spatial audio feature with head tracking other than to say that it's a nice bonus feature it allows you to get virtual surround sound when you're watching movies and tv shows on various apple devices like i said in my airpods 3 review it's a neat effect with video watching but a bit more hit or miss with apple music tracks with dolby atmos it also now works with group facetime calls which is kind of cool the beats fit pro will pair with most other bluetooth audio devices but you'll lose all the extra features like spatial audio and always on hey siri and audio sharing with other people who have airpods however unlike the airpods beats has an app for android devices that makes their buds slightly more friendly to android users at least it's making some effort to appeal to android users from an android perspective the good thing about the beats studio buzz not having an h1 chip was that except for always on hey siri it didn't have those extra apple only features so you didn't feel like you were missing out on anything in this case you are but android users still might consider these thanks to their design strong sound good noise canceling and excellent transparency mode and also good voice calling performance how much backup can't really hear a whole lot of background noise but it seems like when you have a conversation or when you start to speak your the microphones are not picking up your voice that well so you kind of seem faint in the kind of your voice is very low yes they are better than the studio buds and powerbeats pro for making calls but not quite as good as the airpods third generation or airpods pro at least not right now according to beats they have six microphones up to five of which that are used during calls there's a voice accelerometer that helps isolate your voice and a wind mitigation system in my torture tests in the streets of new york they did a decent job reducing background noise but there were some subtle differences between these and the airpods pro the airpods third generation some people said they heard slightly more background noise with the beats and didn't think my voice came across quite as clearly with the noise cancelling on i could hear everyone quite well so no complaints on my end it's quite possible we get some improvements with firmware upgrades but for now i'd have to say these are good for voice calling but a slight step behind both the airpods third generation and airpods pro that said for me the beats fit pro came out as the winner over the airpods pro and are the sporty airpods i've always wanted i like the airpods pro a lot and have no problem keeping them in my ears you can also see how some people like the familiar pipe design of the airpods pro with their now shorter stems and not everybody likes having the beats be splashed across their earbuds but the fit pro really do lock in your ears if you get a tight seal they sound slightly better and have equally good noise canceling their battery life is also a little better it will be interesting to see how much these hurt sales of the beats studio buzz in airpods pro they're hard to compare to the airpods third generation because if you're getting those you're getting them for their open design but i do think you'll see the hundred fifty dollar studio buds on sale more frequently selling for twenty to thirty dollars off and maybe even approaching a hundred dollars while the airpods pro lists for 250 they sell for around 200 and sometimes less online so they're basically the same price as the beats fit pro i guess apple wins either way if you buy one or the other but it's funny to see two models from the same company competing directly with each other maybe it will bring out the best in apple and the airpods pro 2 will be that much better when they arrive perhaps as soon as next year but let me know what you guys think sound off in the comments section and if you're interested in any of the products

Beats Fit Pro Earbuds, what's going on guys drivers consumer and today we've got a new pair of beats let me introduce you to the beats fit pro so these are new earbuds by beets it feels like they just came out with the beats studio buds right it wasn't that long ago but either way we got new beats over here and these i really like but first let's talk about what you get in the box when you pick it up so of course everything comes in a tiny black box around the box you get a little bit of information about what you get inside as well as some of the new features coming to the earbuds but we want to see what's inside and once you pop it open you'll immediately be greeted by the earbuds themselves inside of their case of course but once you pop that case out you'll see it gives you a little tip on how to go ahead and pair it but once you get past that you get some of the accessories in the back of this package you'll see some of the paperwork that it comes with you even get a three month trial of apple music included as well as a beat sticker and some other stuff but back to the accessories you get a pretty short usbc cable and to the left of that you'll get your ear tips so you've got small and large here in case the medium ones that are included on the earbuds don't work out for you but going back to the case it actually reminds me of the powerbeats pro but it's actually a lot thinner and when you open them up you got the earbuds and here you have it you guys these are the beats fit pro but first let's talk about the design let's talk about how these actually look how they fit like i said that case it's actually pretty flat carl you got your powerbeats pro case on you on me no it's too big that's why i don't carry it with me okay fair uh but these are a lot smaller than the powerbeats pro case you might like this car i'll feel that okay felt like i just passed anywho we're talking about the beats bit pro right now these look very similar to the beat studio buds you've got the small bud over here and you've got that b on this like oval shape so that it's very easy to grab pop it in and out this is a good design and now obviously it has that new wing tip and this is supposed to allow the earbuds to of course stay in a lot better than without it so as you guys can see these wing tips kind of rest inside of the ear so when you're doing activities and movement you're jumping all around doing whatever you do it's not going to leave your ears it's going to do a really good job staying in place and from what i've seen it is really nice sometimes my air pods pro they might start to wiggle a little bit but with these i don't have to worry about that they do a really good job staying in place now i'm not the most active guy in the world i you know might do lift little weights here and there but jay come on man up here uh but from what i've noticed so far you know i could shake my head all of this earbuds would have been slipping out by now these they don't budge one thing i will say it does take some getting used to having that wingtip just kind of chill in there not gonna lie used to tickle at first so it's weird to say but it it it just it's a little sensitive you know i'm a grown med your mother tickling my ears but it's true but for me personally i'm okay with that as long as they stay in place because it is so important to have a really good seal so you get the best audio quality out of your earbuds and without having to worry about these i know i'm getting the best that i can so in terms of looks guys what are we what are we saying clean clean i like it now these actually come in four different colors they come in black sage gray stone purple and white i'm not gonna lie after seeing the white one i was like did i make the right choice i mean black goes with everything but that white looks super clean i kind of kind of feel like i missed out but you can't have them all right now beyond the wingtip what else did beets add what other features are there well first and probably the most important thing is these have apple's h1 chip so if you're familiar with like air pods like the airpods 3 airpods pro that's the chip that powers those and allows all kinds of cool features like being able to speak to the earbuds by saying hey siri it also allows it to connect to your icloud account whatever your apple devices may be it'll automatically switch between them without you having to press pretty much anything so if i'm playing a song right here and then i pause it and i start playing something on that imac is automatically going to send the audio straight to the earbuds without touching anything so if you're in the apple ecosystem these are going to fit right in unlike the beats studio buds that had a different kind of chip this is going to work perfectly now even though this is fully integrated with the apple ecosystem the android operating system isn't being left out there's an android app that you can download that'll give you pretty much all of the features except a few like you won't be able to use the find my feature so you can find the earbuds through the find my app because that doesn't exist on android and you'll also lose out on of course the hey siri the icloud account that kind of stuff you won't get any of that but that makes sense but if you have an android device and you still want to get the beats fits pro you'll have the app that works so you can get all the features that come with it and still have a good time now these also have a feature that we just saw come to the airpods 3 and that is that skin detecting optical sensor now that's huge talked about it in our airpods 3 review if you haven't seen that i'll have it linked down below in the description but basically it has that optical sensor so it knows when it's actually in your ear now the reason why that's cool is sometimes you know you take out your earbuds and you know when you take them off your ear they automatically pause with the optical sensors it'll know when it's in your pocket or against a surface that isn't actual skin it'll work in your hand interestingly enough because it's skin but most importantly it'll only really work in your ears so that should also save on battery because it's not just playing music while in your pocket or your backpack or something and these also have active noise cancelling as well as the transparency mode that we like to see with apple's earbuds and they work very very well here transparency mode active noise cancelling very good now let's say you don't have active noise cancelling or transparency mode on you get adaptive eq it'll detect the audio that you're hearing from your ears with microphones it'll adjust the medium to low frequencies to basically give you the best audio quality to fit your ears so that mode is only going to be available when active noise cancelling and transparency mode are off but when it's in this mode it'll actually give you about seven hours of battery life and when you have the active noise canceling or transparency it'll drop it down to six so i'll just throw up the numbers so you guys can see make life easier but battery life is decent now of course these also have spatial audio i feel like we've talked about spatial audio a lot on the channel so basically what this does is with the device that you're listening to let's say it's an iphone it can detect the placement of the phone it uses the gyroscope and the accelerometer to understand your head position and the device position and you can move your head around and the audio will pretty much stay fixed so kind of like if you were speaking to someone in person it's gonna be the same sensation it's pretty wild at first you guys but it's it's really cool now there's also another side of spatial audio when it comes to music it basically creates like the spear of audio is actually pretty interesting it definitely feels more immersive so it's there you should give it a try see if you like it it's definitely going to be something a lot of people will enjoy but i'm just a fan of normal audio i do like spatial audio though for watching content i think that's really cool i can't even believe we didn't talk about this yet but of course this has a built-in button so the b is an actual button you can control all of your audio right from here like we see with any other earbuds i know a lot of you asked me judd what about the mic quality so we'll start talking about mic quality a little bit more i'll be sure to try to remember to tell you guys about that uh but the mic quality here is great uh i just got off the phone with arie and i was asking her like how does this sound she's like oh did you change like she didn't even realize that i changed to ear but she said it sounds exactly the same as speaking on the phone so that is always a good thing so while we're on the topic of like how things sound let's talk about the audio quality now these sound great to me i personally really like these they get surprisingly loud you guys uh i was crank i was just ready to crank up the volume when i first tried these on and i just kept going i was just like oh i actually got to bring it down it's not something i typically experience with truly wireless earbuds but i did feel the need to like bring the volume down kind of have it sit around like the 80 mark 80 to 90 i felt pretty comfortable with that i was very happy with the bass response that i got out of these vocals were very clear this is some really rich audio you guys i can't imagine a specific genre of music that wouldn't work well with these i've tried to throw a bunch of stuff at it and i have a wide range of music tastes you know this carl and it worked out very nicely for pretty much everything i've been doing a lot of switching i went from the airpods pro to the beats studio buds back to no to the sony wf-1000x mark fours back to the airpods pro and now i think these will really truly dethrone the airpods because i love the way they sound and the fit the fit is what's so important to me and i don't have to worry about that here so i'm very happy to have what feels like an upgrade and with these i'm not missing out any of the features that i had with the airpods pro and they come in at 200 bucks you guys cheaper than the airpods pro by 50 bucks a little bit more than the airpods three those are 179 these are 199. so 20 bucks more but i am super happy with these because you get all of those extra features like active noise canceling all that good stuff that about wraps up this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy go like give this video a thumbs up and catch you guys in the next one until then it's your average consumer peace you need to upgrade to these cars halloween what is this trick or treat for earbuds get out of here carl you gotta go
Beats Fit Pro Earbuds," So i finally got my hands on a pair of beats 
fit pro earbuds I'm of course going to try   them out and give you the lowdown, but the main 
thing I'm going to focus on is whether the Beats   Fit Pro stay put, because I'm sick and tired 
of my current earbuds the Apple Airpods Pro   falling out of my ears, so I'm going to try 
them out and see how I get on with them.   If you've watched some of my other videos 
on earbuds, you will know that for me   finding the right earbuds for working out isn't 
always as simple as picking up the first pair that   I like to look of, they have to perform well in 
the situations that I'm going to be in when I wear   them, otherwise they're useless to me. These Beats 
Fit Pro will be mainly used for the gym, so I need   them to have noise-cancelling that actually works 
well, to not fall out of my ears whatever I'm doing,   and to also not run out of battery halfway through 
my workout. My current workout earbuds are the   Apple AirPods Pro, these are great at giving me 
nice clear sound quality, I also like the noise   cancelling feature which helps to drown out some 
of the noises of the other people and other things   happening around the gym when I'm trying to focus 
on my workout, no other earbuds that I've tried   have been as good at drowning out outside noises 
without me having to turn the volume all the way   up to a ridiculous level which of course would 
be harmful to my ears over time. Now the problem   with these is that they sometimes fall out of 
my ears when I do certain things such as when   I lay horizontally during bench presses or if I'm 
laid out flat doing stretches or something of that   nature. To say the least, it gets annoying having 
to constantly pick them up and adjust them so   I'm looking for earbuds that offer me the sound 
quality that I currently have with the AirPods Pro   and to combine them with the ability to actually 
stay put when I do things like bench skipping   stretching whatever it may be. In steps the Beats 
Fit Pro! I actually reviewed the previous earbuds   from Beats, they were called the Beats Studio 
and to be honest they were a bit of a letdown   I'll put a link in the description so you can see 
that video after this one, my main gripe about the   Studio Pros was that the noise-cancelling on them 
just wasn't anywhere near the level as the AirPods   Pros, so I'm really excited to see what the noise 
cancelling on these Beats Fit Pro will be like.   The first thing you'll probably notice about the 
Beats Fit Pro is the price, at the time of making   this video they're nearly double the price of the 
Beats Studio Pros which could mean that they offer   higher quality and they have features that work 
better, or that possibly they've gone back and fixed   some of the little annoyances that made the Beats 
Studio a bit of a letdown, let's see now let's look   at the features that actually matter to me, the 
main features that I care about is whether they   fall out of my ears when I'm working out and 
I'll tell you how they fared a little later on   so the main features that set these apart from 
other earbuds in the same category are the sweat   proof and water resistance, they will resist a 
little bit of sweat and a little bit of water   so if you're a heavy sweater during your workout 
or if you work out in light rain it shouldn't   affect the functionality of these earbuds. active 
noise-cancelling to block out outside noises and   the flexible wing tips to give you more of a 
secure fit and of course stop them from falling   out. There are of course other features such as 
spatial audio and battery life offering you   six hours of listening time and the case acting as 
a charger also. Normally when earbuds of this type   have a case it's normally a charging case as well 
so I expected that from these sorts of earbuds   anyway. Now, when it came to working out with them 
the Beats Fit Pro offer similar noise-cancelling   to the Apple AirPods Pro to be fair these did 
a pretty good job of cancelling out the outside   sounds around me. It wasn't so strong that i wasn't 
able to hear anything else, someone shouting in the   distance could still be heard, but I'd say 70% 
of the sound around me was cancelled out which   is pretty effective I felt like I was in my own 
little sound bubble and nobody could distract me   now the sweatproof and water-resistant ability i 
do tend to get really sweaty when I train cardio   days and leg days especially my head does get a 
little sweaty when i work out but not so sweaty   that my headphones will be drenched and the sound 
will cut out, however when I did sweat, I didn't   notice any difference in the operation of 
these earbuds. How did the battery hold up?   The battery held up fine in three weeks I only 
had to charge them maybe three times and they   never completely fully lost their charge which 
is really good. The thing is, when it comes to   reviewing things that run off batteries is that 
batteries over the years do lose their strength   but I can say over the three weeks that i 
used these the battery held up brilliantly.   Now, did they fall out of my ears? Now, the 
burning question for me is whether they   fell out of my ears or not and the answer 
is no they didn't fall out of my ears once   which is very impressive. Working out with these 
was interesting I did everything I normally do   skipping workouts bench press stretching olympic 
ring work and i didn't have to adjust them at all   once they were in they were in very impressed 
that's a big improvement from the Studio Pros   that I reviewed earlier now there were a couple 
of minor annoyances with these, the only couple   of minor annoyances that I would note is that 
like the studio pros before them, it's very   easy to accidentally press the button on them 
and pause your music but this wasn't really   much of a deal-breaker for me because they did 
everything else really well. If I've helped you   in any way please leave a like on this video, 
that was my review of the Beats Fit Pro earbuds   definitely an improvement on the previous pair 
with a little minor annoyance that wasn't really   a deal-breaker for me. So thank you for watching 
my review and I'll see you in the next one :)  "
Beats Fit Pro Earbuds, let's go ahead boom bam bam oh my God I got the look what's going on guys the traffic consumer and today we're going to be doing a comparison that I've gotten a lot of requests for and that's with the brand new airpods Pro second generation versus these guys the Beats fit Pro now I've been daily driving the Beats fit Pro since their release until of course I started testing the airpods prosecond Gen so I spent a lot of time with both of these so let's talk about what's different now these are from beats obviously and these are Apple honestly they're both Apple Apple owns Beats and passes all their technology to the Beats brand so it's pretty much apple versus Apple but Beats does have more compatibility when it comes to Android so this is a little more Universal now from a design perspective we've seen the airpods pro 2nd gen before the airpods pro first gen so these guys right here look exactly like the originals nothing too surprising we've seen these for a few years now and you know they fit and sit in the ear just the same uh what's nice though with these is Apple has come out with new silicone tips they've got like this extra small size so it should fit even more people if you've had trouble getting the right seal for your ears they do offer a few options now and then we've got the Beats fit Pro now I personally like the way these look they sit in the ear like this and they do have a wingtip so it gives you even more security when it comes to staying in your ears so it's kind of like trading a downward stem for an upward stem they have they have different functionalities but that's kind of how it works right there let's go ahead boom bam bam oh you've got I got the look now like I said I kind of like the way the beads fit Pro look I find that these stay in my ears a little bit better than the standard airpods Pro having that extra security from the wingtip is always ideal since I usually have struggles keeping the earbuds in my ears not to mention the Beats fit Pro offer a few options you've got black white I think there's like this lavender or pink and this green also and then they got those Kim Kardashian colors if you wanted to match your skin tone or something so they've got a lot of options out there so it's really up to you that's definitely one leg up that this has over the airpods since these basically they they just come in white now if you look at the buds they're roughly the same size but you know they just have that difference in design with the wingtip and the stem so which look do we like more fellas you like the Beats as well yeah yeah this one you know screams airpods now another difference in design and this one's pretty big are the cases so the airpods pro case looks exactly the same as the previous generation whereas the Beats fit Pro it's a bit bigger it's actually quite a bit bigger and you can see when you're throwing these things into your pocket that size makes a pretty big difference they can both go in no problem sits right there but one is definitely far more compact than the other you guys can see right there the Speed Pro airpods Pro and I will say this has like a matte finish to it which for me personally I find is a bit more slippery uh these this case has slipped out my hands quite a few times whereas with this I feel like it's a little bit easier to keep in the hand but yeah much bigger case over here compared to this one one thing that the airpods pro case does have is this little hole for a lanyard I think Apple's gonna be selling them for like 13 bucks so if you don't want to put this in your pocket you want to walk around with it uh you can go ahead and add one of those to this and when it comes to truly wireless earbuds the cases nowadays are a pretty big deal and they have features themselves now the airpods pro have quite a few features built into the actual case we've got a built-in speaker right here at the bottom and this is absolutely amazing in case you misplace your air pods and you want to use the find my app to send off a little sound so you can track them down it's so nice check it out so if you use the find my app you can just hit play sound and you get finding this with no problem not to mention this also has Precision tracking so if you're trying to locate them let's throw that over there you can just hit the find button so you can see that it's connected and you've got an arrow that'll tell you where to go eight feet ahead I can walk over to it and tells you exactly where it is so for me those are huge huge features because because I lose myself all the time Jay leave me alone so yeah that's a feature I use on a daily basis absolutely necessary you don't have that here with the Beats fit Pro and while we're talking about missing cases or earbuds you can play a sound to locate the earbuds of the Beats fit Pro in the find my app so you see you hear that little sound that's if you misplace them you're trying to track down the singular earbuds so you got that option that's the only thing that you can find and track with these whereas with the airpods pro you get a little bit more when it comes to the earbuds so under the airpods you have each earbud listed so if you want to find a specific one you can play a sound so you've got that ping so you can find it now in case you can't hear it while it's not Precision tracking you can use a fine feature for these as well so it can detect the signal of the airpod and if you're a bit further away it'll tell you hey the airpods are nearby keep moving so you can try and find it and as you get a little bit closer to it to it it'll say your airpods are nearby look in this vicinity look for your airpods nearby that's what it says down here so it does have a bit of a leg up compared to the Beats fit Pro actually that is quite a leg up you can't find the Beats fit Pro the way you can find these so as part of it being a new product but I'm sure we'll see that in the next piece of it pro and I believe these are both ipx4 water and sweat resistant um but the case for the new airpods are also ipx4 rated so you know little splashes maybe you take the spot of the pool or something I don't know it has some resistance to it as well now let's talk a little bit about the features both of these feature active noise cancellation and transparency mode so let's just get transparency mode out of the way they both are great Apple has magic when it comes to transparency mode it feels as if you don't have anything in your ears you can hear everything around you very clearly now when it comes to active noise cancellation these are solid I've been using these for so long they've been good to me uh but Apple went ahead and really upgraded the active noise cancellation on these Once you turn it on it feels like you're blocking out everything like it is a significant upgrade compared to this where this probably has the same level of active noise cancellation as maybe the Gen 1 airpods Pro so these are a very clear winner when it comes to active noise cancellation it's night and day now when it comes to physical controls with the airpods you've got the stem with the force touch so you can hold it down to play double tap to this music is so loud whoa and that's one of the new features on these you can control the volume by sliding down on the stem so you have those new features there you don't have that with these guys but what these have versus the air pods are physical buttons so you can throw these in your ear tap to play double tap to skip triple tap to go back they're a little sensitive like sometimes you might press these by accident when you're just trying to adjust them in your ears where you won't have that issue with these since you have to like force touch is not as convenient as the buttons now a lot of the features are going to overlap like we do have that skin detect feature so when you don't have the earbuds in your ears and you put them in your pocket or something it's going to be able to tell that it's not in your actual ear and not play your music automatically a lot of earbuds just have proximity sensors and when they feel like something's close they start playing no accidental plays with both of these guys but I will say if you're interested in these earbuds and you're not part of the Apple ecosystem or maybe you have like a Macbook and an Android phone whatever your situation may be these like I said are a bit more Universal because they do have the Android app so with that you get a lot of the controls that you want to access from Android it right from that app whereas with the airpods you're going to be controlling things physically so turning on the active noise cancellation by holding down the stem or turning on transparency mode by holding on the stem so that kind of stuff you don't have app integration with Android so that also means no find my capabilities so all those good find my earbud features you're not going to be able to access this whereas with this you'll still be able to Ping the actual earbuds through the app so you can locate them and of course you can call out to Siri with both of these earbuds give it commands as well as have them read any kind of notifications that come in but they both have great integration with IOS as you can see they're both listed over here and in these settings you can control and toggle all kinds of things like automatic ear detection you can do the fit test with both of them to make sure you're getting the right seal to get of course the best audio quality definitely worth doing regardless of which one you pick up so that you're getting the best sound quality and surprisingly you still get the personalized spatial audio feature with the Beats fit Pro that's something that was pretty much introduced with these guys over here but now when it comes to the airpods pro you get all of those same features but you do get a few settings that you can use for the case uh like the charging sounds I believe when you charge it it makes like a little chime there's a couple of Chimes that go off with this I personally like them but if you don't like them yourself you can go ahead and turn them off right in the settings so when it comes to the sound quality I gotta say I'm impressed of what Apple's been able to do with the airpods pro second gen now I've been pretty happy with the overall sound from the Beats fit Pro since they came out I think that these sound really good um but I'm a person who loves Basin like to hear the fullness of a song and with what Apple has done with the new airpods you get a good bit more bass over here uh songs just sound a little bit more full now the Gap in sound quality isn't as large between these two as the airpods pro second gen versus the first gen these Stills to me sound pretty good especially when you get the seal just right but these Edge it out just by a bit so I really like the fullness on the lower end that you get from these so if you if you love hearing a bit of bass these are going to be a little bit better and last but not least let's talk about the battery life so we've got six hours over here with the Beats fit Pro with an additional 18 hours from the case totaling for 24 hours and when it comes to the airpods pro you you get a total of six hours of battery life with active noise canceling seven without and with the case you get a total of 30 hours altogether so these do have better battery life and they both have a quick charge feature where five minutes of charging is going to give you an hour of listening now also in the vein of batteries uh the cases this one has no wireless charging but it does have USBC so you can charge with a USBC cable over here of course the airpods uses lightning but not only can you charge it with a lightning cable but you also get wireless charging as well what's nice though is that this also is compatible with magsafe so if you have magsafe accessories you can smack this right onto it it's going to hold on to it just fine or if you have an Apple Watch you can charge with an Apple Watch charger now last but not least we've got to talk about the prices so you can get the Beats fit Pro for 199 whereas the airpods pro you're gonna have to pay 249. so a difference of 50 bucks I do think that the active noise cancellation as well as like the find my features that you can get with these kind of make it worth it I misplaced myself all the time so that find my ability is super clutch to me while I do like the overall design and fit of these a bit more this just helps in a lot of other ways that I just can't ignore so it's really up to what you value do you want a specific color you want the certain look maybe the wing tips help the earbuds stay in your ear a bit better and you value that more or do you care about the features that this brings and the better active noise cancellation for me it's going to be the airpods but I wouldn't be mad at anybody who picked these up and say 50 bucks but let me know what you guys think with a comment down below which one would you guys pick up honestly if they come out with a second generation of these I think it's going to be killer because it's probably going to have all the same features that this one has and once that drops I'll probably jump ship leave these behind and go for the Beats fit Pro 2 whenever that drops if it drops but that about wraps it up for this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy girl that gives this video a thumbs up I'm Gonna Catch You guys in the next one till then it's your average consumer peace I don't know why Apple doesn't just make a black one like just make a black one any other something please Apple
Beats Fit Pro Earbuds, yo what's up everybody it's your boy floss back again with another video and today we're going to take a look at the beats fit pro now you can pick these up online i'll throw the link up in the description the price on these 200 bucks i repeat 200 bucks now they come in four different colors you got black space gray white and purple all right so let's go through all the

devices and access to the find my app now you got custom built transducers with 9.5 millimeter drivers you got spatial audio adaptive eq with dynamic head tracking now these feature active noise cancellation and transparency mode you got six mics that's going to give you crystal clear hands-free calling the battery life on these is six hours on a single charge with an additional 21 hours using the charging case that's what anc turned on now if you turn on if you turn off noise cancellation you're gonna get seven hours with an additional 25 hours using the case and it takes one and a half hours to fully charge these up now you also got fast charge five minutes of charge will give you one hour worth of play time now you also have touch controls for playing pause volume up and down skipping reverse tracks answering them phone calls and access to your voice assistant now these do feature app for android but the problem with that is you're not going to have all of the ios features so you're not going to have spatial audio no icloud sharing no find my app and know our hands-free siri alright so all of that for 200 bucks let's see what it is first things first shout out to white shoes back in the building [Music] calm down now at the end of this video i'm going to answer a couple of questions number one are these really worth 200 bucks number two where do i rank these versus my top apple earbuds number one on my list the airpod pros number two the studio buds and number three the powerbeats pro now the side note everybody always asks me what's my favorite earbuds for the gym and if you read the comments it's always the powerbeats pro and that's for one reason the air hooks these will not fall out of my ears now lately i've been trying to use the studio buds because they have anc and the power beats don't but the problem with the studio buds is they will fall out of my ears at the end of my workout now i tend to sweat a lot and at the end of my workout i'm doing my decline bench i'm doing my calisthenics and of course my 100 back flips and these will move around a little bit now anybody that works out you know one of the most annoying things in the world is when you're trying to do that last set and you sweating extra hard and you grunting and your earbuds move even just a little bit when your earbuds move that tends to mess up your whole workout so the powerbeats pro these have always been my gym buds because they will not move so now let's see if we get a new champ power beats fit uh power beats beats fit bro okay it's early in the morning y'all bear with me beats fit pro here we go okay now that was a little fail just now okay let's see if i can peel these off let me just grab a little unboxing knife so this way my angle levels don't increase okay here we go okay okay there we go let me just calm down look you see this is why sometimes you just gotta calm down and do things correctly ladies and gentlemen this is some major trolling going on by beats okay here we go okay nice black box y'all know i like that giggity okay got your little beats logo inside now these are gonna be your beats fit pro this is the case nice little uh red beats logo i like that let's see what else you get now let's see the charging on these this is going to be usb type c to usb type c let's see the length on this cable not that long that's what she said let's see anything else okay so you got your usual books and [ __ ] and of course your beach troll sticker let me go ahead and save that and let's see do we get any different size ear tips there it is all right different size air tips so it looks like small and large medium should be pre-installed that's it for that now here's your charging case let's open this up there it is beats fit pro let's take a look at the buds okay nice and small you got your wings or your fins whatever you want to call them right now these are not removable nice silicone tips just drop them back in got it on the first try and there it is all right so let me pause the video i'll grab a phone we'll pair these up and we'll start our usual testing talk amongst alright guys so we back in first just for size comparison here's the difference between all of the cases so the airpods pro smallest case then the studio buds then the fit then the powerbeats pro all right now this is a big giant case but again you got to fit those hooks in there now for the beats fit pro the charging case no wireless charge on this it is nice and lightweight matte finish so no fingerprints on the back this is a usb type-c charging slot on the front you got a little led on the inside nice and clean there's your bluetooth pairing button let's check the magnet strength let's start with minimum shake edge okay no movement intermediate shakeage no movement maximum shakeage no movement at all excellent strength on the magnets now let's take a look at the actual earbuds and for size comparison here's your airpod pros he's got the stems here's your studio buds these are the smallest here's your powerbeats pro now these are the biggest but you got the hooks and here's the fit pro now i'm curious to see how these are going to fit in my ears but you got the wings got the red beats logo okay there's all your mics all your sensors physical buttons with a nice little click real nice all right so now let's check the pairing process first we'll start off with an android phone so we'll just open these up there's your prompt hit pair and there it is just like that now let's go through some of the features real quick you can rename these here's your product serial number firmware register simple enough now let's pair them up with an iphone let's open these up hit connect hold the button and there it is connecting okay so let's take the little uh tutorial media controls just like that that was a little tutorial all right hit done and you're all set all right so now let's put the name to the test these are the beats fit pro let's see how they fit how they feel and how they look all right so i'm going to slap them with my ears okay adjusting the little wingtips it's a nice snug tight comfortable fit i must have on transparency mode because i can hear myself perfectly fine and any earbuds that have fit in the name we can't just test for maximum shakeage we're gonna have to step it up to ludicrous shakeage so let me make sure these are in nice and tight okay let's start off with minimum shakeage okay no movement at all intermediate shakeage no movement here it goes maximum shaking no movement and my hat just flew off now let's take it up to ludicrous shakeage okay here we go okay my hair just came down everything came down literally no movement at all so ladies and gentlemen i'm pretty safe to say that it's over for my power beats pro let me show you how these look all right so here's how they're going to look in your ears you see how that ring is right in my ear hole my ear canal which i call it the air ball right in my ear ball these are not moving at all now i'm gonna do a little bit more vigorous testing but i did maximum and ludicrous shakeage and these did not move one inch so they're living up to the name the fit pro these fit pro okay one more thing now a lot of people always ask me how come i don't record myself doing the head shake test and the answer is simple everything does not need to be memorialized if you see that image you can't unsee it uh you're going to lose a lot of respect for me if you see me shaking my head like that all right so now let's do the sound test now i got a classic song queued up we got michael jackson rock with you now i'm going to start off with max volume i got spatial audio turned on because i love that feature i got active noise cancellation turned on and of course i promise y'all i'm not going to sing here we go birdman hands rubbing together one tap for playing pause let's get into it okay here we go okay [Music] crystal clear crystal clear oh these sounds terrific [Music] girl close your eyes let that rhythm get into you let's go don't try to fight it there ain't nothing that you can do [Music] had to grab my mic let's go i don't know all right hold up all right here we go one shot for playing for us i know y'all young cats was getting when i said rocky out young castles get ready look drop the boat rock them what now they say this ain't that version this is the original og version okay these sound incredible let me take it over to the base test y'all know we got to do we got a new bass test song shout out to uh tom brady for putting me onto the new bass test song that i forgot all about okay love sosa all right here we go now let me just give you my initial impressions i think these sound better than the studio buds and better than the airpod pros now of course better than the powerbeats pro because these have anc and transparency mode these are just regular earbuds so these are already winning okay here we go let me calm down reel it in all right here we go love sosa this is the this is the new b the new uh bass test if y'all never heard this song trust me this is this song is maximum bass here we go all right hold up oh there we go here we go here we go let's go let's get ah hold up let's get let's get the um let's get let's get the um actual video version so we can skip over the talk all right here we go here it goes this is my number one get hyped song whoa okay love sosa i love salsa and then you gotta whisper that part all right here we go there we go hey hey god y'all son bro [ __ ] with them old boys you go get [ __ ] over rory's and rovers these hoes love chisosa hit them with that cobra now that boy slumped over they do it all for so so you boys they make it no noise all right i'm gonna go for the flavor bro boy god y'all son bro y'all bro boy let me calm down okay okay okay whoo let's do this what i'm talking about see let me take these out for a minute this is what i love about beach earbuds they're made for this kind of music okay now look if you're about to play beethoven's greatest hits go with the airpod pros right now if you're getting ready if you're getting ready to throw in some trap music some dubstep some hardcore hip-hop some techno dance something with a lot of bass you're going to like these you're going to like these these sound great let me do some more testing all right so now let's do the reconnection test how long do this take to reconnect to your phone after you take them out and put them in the charging case so you see it's connected let's hit play on the music okay there it is pop them out automatic pause i like that drop them in the case close them up disconnect it here we go one mississippi two mississippi three mississippi three mississippis that's excellent all right so now let's do the one earbud test can you play music from one earbud while the other one is charging up in the case all right here we go i got the music playing let's take out the left earbud drop it in the case hit play on the music okay the right side is playing let's put the left earbud back in wait for it to reconnect okay there it is now put the right side in the music automatically pauses let's hit play there it is the music is playing so this is pretty dope you can play music from either earbud while the other one is charging up in the case basically doubling your battery life alright so now let's check the touch controls and on the side note you can customize these through the app but the way i got mine set up is one tap for playing pause okay there it is that'll also answer and phone calls double tap to skip to the next song okay there it is triple tap to go back okay and long press the cycle between anc and transparency mode i'm gonna hold it down you hear a little bloom okay now now i'm clearly in transparency mode i hear everything and of course for voice assistant hey siri what's the weather for today there it is all of the touch controls work all right so now let's check the call quality now am i in school so i'm going to call up motorceps let's get max volume yeah hi uh can i speak to fred or leo yeah this flossy all right whoever that was that answered the phone they don't know me all right so they got some new cat there you do not know me all right they got me a hold now i will say this this is mad loud oh okay who's this fatty oh how you doing fatty let me ask you a question all right um how does my voice sound i'm using some earbuds i'm trying to see if the if my voice sounds good or not can you understand everything i'm saying it sounds clear oh okay okay okay okay that's all i wanted to know all right so all right so tell them i'll go back later all right no problem all right all right now [Laughter] that guy speaks russian so you know it's a little we we i heard him perfectly fine he heard me perfectly fine but he was more he was like uh going back later you know you make a bigger phone go back later now i heard it with no problems if you ever use any apple earbuds you already know they're known for the call quality and these are just the same right call quality sounds pretty good i'll do a little bit more testing off camera and i want to test these out versus my favorite earpods uh earpods my favorite earbuds for phone calls earpod pros all right so i'm gonna call up one of my boys i'm not gonna do this on camera but i'm gonna do a quick test and see which ones sound better all right so i just called my brother on the phone had a little conversation of course i broke out the brookstone fan so i could do the wind test and my brother said believe it or not i sounded better using the airpod pros now he said the uh beats fit pros were pretty good but the airpod pros just sounded a little bit more crystal clear and when i did the wind test he heard less wind so these are still the reigning champs for phone call quality all right so i just came back from doing a little workout so now we can talk about the rest of the features now as far as the range test i walked all the way to 50 feet no drop connection at all as far as latency i watched some youtube videos netflix and amazon prom no lag when you're watching your videos now active noise cancellation and transparency mode the transparency mode on these are some of the best that i've heard yet you can hear your voice crystal clear with your earbuds in now it doesn't have too much of that robotic kind of sound to it a little bit as all transparency earbuds do but not that much these are perfect for leaving in your ears and talking to your co-workers talking to the uh guy at the deli talking to people in the gym without taking the ear buds off now active noise cancellation y'all know i got three tiers we got trash tear okay tear and top tier okay and of course the mythical god tier that belongs to the sony and the bows these are not god tear i would place these at top tier noise cancellation right on par with the airpod pros right on par with the sennheisers and the pi7s and the eqs these are top tier noise cancellation perfect for the gym now speaking of the gym the biggest test that i wanted to do is see if i could really work out with these on and these not move around in my ears at all even when i start sweating extra hard i threw a little bit of water on my head too just to uh simulate the extra sweat now i don't sweat that much as flashing water on my face like that in my ears but these do not move so to make it a simple all right to make it simple let me answer those three questions number one audi's worth 200 bucks and the answer is yes worth every penny the sound quality is terrific active noise cancellation top tier more battery life than the earpod pros they look great they fit great did i say fit great they fit perfectly like the beats fit pro these should be called the beats fit perfect all right you're gonna like that wing next question how do i rank these versus my favorite apple earbuds these are now number one okay these are my number one apple earbuds number two i'm going with the airpod pros and number three the studio buds okay and the last question can these replace my powerbeats pro and the answer is yes now look there is still going to be a market for the powerbeats pro some people don't care about anc which i don't understand why a lot of people think active noise cancellation is some kind of gimmick don't knock it till you try it okay if you've been using these for the last two years and you think these sound great when you try these you're gonna notice that they sound a little bit better than the powerbeats but it's gonna feel like they sound a lot more better a lot more better a lot better better or more better whatever way you want to say it you're going to notice that the fit pros they're going to sound a lot better a lot more better i think i said it right a lot more better because of active noise cancellation okay i always tell people whenever they say active noise cancellation is a gimmick think about it like this whatever earbuds that you got without anc if you think they sound good imagine how better they're gonna sound now that word is trolling me imagine how much more better they're gonna sound when all of your background noise is blocked out now you can just focus on the music that's the main downfall for the powerbeats pro no anc now hopefully they come out with a set of wings like this powerbeats pro number twos with a and c because like i said there is a market for the wings people that do gymnastics people that do extreme sports right now i just did a regular workout but extreme sports you may want the hooks the hooks never move i don't care how many backflips i do some of y'all be thinking i'm camping when i say i do 36 backflips okay maybe i'm exaggerating a little maybe not 36 34. all right when i do my 34 black fix these never move at all my full workout with the power uh i keep saying beats my full workout with the beats fit pro these did not move at all these are the truth okay on a scale of 110 i'm giving these a major major major go these are now the best earbuds you could get from apple and at 200 bucks as bob barker would say the price is right anyway beats fit pro hit me up in the comments let me know what y'all think about

Beats Fit Pro Earbuds, so this might be a bold claim but i think the beats fit pro are the best earbuds apple ever made not just because they're amazing for apple users but because unlike almost all other apple products the beats design team is aware of some of the amazing technologies that are not apple like usb type c android support and stemless designs to name a few which is nothing against apple apple makes some amazing products but it's nice to see some cross pollination here giving you a pair of earbuds that is really across the market going to be very satisfactory no matter if you're an android user or an iphone user the beats fit pro are possibly going to be the best earbuds for you because beats was purchased by apple you kind of get the best of both worlds the non-apple world and the apple world for a while beats didn't have really anything in terms of wireless earbuds and they kind of started to fade away like the brand wasn't as big as it once was but we're starting to get some really great things out of this like the h1 chip the ecosystem support within apple and some amazing active noise cancellation technology among many other things that make the airpods the best selling earbuds on the market so now bringing a lot of that stuff to a more android friendly device and with drastically different design i think this is very impressive pair of earbuds and honestly one of the most exciting this year so why do i say that these are better than the airpods pro well there's really three main things we're going to be talking about in this video one of them being the design which is obviously very very different the second one being kind of a bundle of the microphones anc and sound you'll see what i mean by that in a second and then the third one being the software compatibility features like that kind of all bundled together and well i want to get into some testing and analysis because honestly there are a lot of things i really like about these but a few that i'm not the biggest fan of but i want to first start off with what's actually different about these specifically comparing them to the airpods pro and i want to talk about the design again breaking it down in three sub-categories the first being what i think these do better than the airpods pro so the first thing when you look at the design the earbuds themselves i think look better and feel better than the airpods pro with this little wingtip instead of a stem so i think the stemless design although the airpods stem i know it's iconic people love it personally i think it looks better if you don't have that stem and so lots of people recognize the beats logo so it's still going to be a really nice looking pair of earbuds and unlike the air pods you also have a lot of different colors with these so personally for those reasons the lack of stem the the little fit here the beats logo and the different colors i think that these are going to look better and i think a lot of people agree compared to the airpods pro but you can take a vote below and let me know what do you think of these as far as aesthetics go but besides aesthetics the other main difference here is going to be the fit and comfort so i've always really liked the air pods fit they're always very comfortable in my ears but one drawback for me was that security if i'm running if i'm doing something more dynamic it's not unlikely that they would work their way out of my ears and being that so many people have all different shapes of ears obviously like that was one of the big reasons that the galaxy buds and the galaxy buds plus were a strong recommendation on this channel like they had those wing tips that could perfectly fit anybody's ears and now with this new wingtip design that's that's actually flexible so you don't replace it you just bend it to whatever like you put in your ear like this and you twist back and it kind of goes right up into this little crevice on your ear i don't know terminology of medical stuff but but it seems to fit very well on a lot of people on top of that it's incredibly secure and i think this is what the pixel buds were trying to do but i think the beats fit pro just really mastered it and i mean i can't emphasize enough how comfortable and secure these earbuds actually are now i know some people really liked the beat the powerbeats from a couple years ago because they had that ear hook i would argue that if you really like those i still recommend trying these it's not an ear hook but i think it's just as secure if not more secure and a lot lighter and smaller now some other things that are very different about these another one is the physical button on the outside personally i think this is better than a force sensor because if you're outside running or working out and you have gloves on like four sensors are kind of small and finicky a button is something easy to press easy to locate and it's one of the reasons i've really liked the jabra earbuds on this channel for a long time now granted i think the jabra button is slightly better than this just because when you put these in your ear it's very easy when you're new to these to push the button when you're trying to adjust them and on more than one occasion i've accidentally hung up on phone call when i was adjusting the earbuds but once you get used to it that button is incredibly useful i think it's really the right thing to have on a pair of earbuds especially something that's meant for working out when your hands might be sweaty uh they might be too cold for like touch sensors or if you're wearing gloves it's just the right way to do this the buttons allow you to press once twice three times or press and hold for different controls but unfortunately you can't customize them at all and there is no volume control with that but moving on to another thing that these do better and i know a big long list of physical design things that that i think these do better than the airpods pro which to be fair i like the airpods pro but these charge by usb type c and i don't care how far you're into the apple ecosystem if you have like a macbook an ipad like you already have a usb type-c cable and if you have literally anything that's not made by apple you have usb type-c cable so type c i think really is the right way to go and these are beats so it's no surprise or type c but still a huge win that they're not like a lightning cable and speaking of charging the battery on these is also pretty good you have six hours in the earbuds in 18 hours when you include the case i was surprised it wasn't a little bit more with how large the case is but 24 hours that's a solid battery right there i think it's also worth noting that these are cheaper than the airpods pro but of course that depends on sales these are starting off at 200 the airpods pro were originally 250 but being two years old they're about the same price right now now there are some things that are similar to the airpods pro i don't want to get too into these but really the geometry of the ear facing side so like the silicone tip the proximity sensor the shape of that it's a lot like the airpods pro which giving you a lot of the same functionality there the same sensors on board that give you like the 360 audio spatial audio if you look around and these also have ipx4 water resistance again the same we're seeing on the airpods pro however i was expecting a little bit better than ipx4 on a fitness oriented pair of earbuds but i mean i guess like ipx4 is good for sweat and rain and they probably figured you're probably not gonna be jumping into water with these which i i hope you're not and while i've been saying that these are better than the airpods pro in a lot of ways there are two main things that the airpods pro just did best one of them being the case the overall size and shape of it you can see this case right here is absolutely huge especially compared to the airpods so that's a bit of a downside especially since you're not getting like a massive difference in battery and the other one the huge one like i don't know this one blows my mind i don't know why they did this so in 2021 for a 200 pair of relatively premium earbuds you're not getting wireless charging i don't know why the case doesn't have wireless charging that just blows my mind with a case this big it'd be so easy to fit a coil in there they didn't do it who knows why but that's a huge drawback there so now getting into the next category of the sound the anc and the microphones starting off with the microphones this is something the airpods have done well for a long time so this is what it sounds like indoors in a studio environment if i was talking on the phone with you using the beats fit pro so leave a comment and let me know how the microphone sounds honestly this is no surprise that they sound great but let's go outside in a louder environment and see how they handle noisier situations all right and there's a microphone test outside with some cars behind me a little bit of traffic here also a bit of a breeze so as expected these still sound really good now as far as the sound quality goes when you're listening to music overall it's very typical of a pair of beats although slightly less bass heavy so what does this mean well beats usually have powerful boomy bass and although this bass is a little bit less powerful than most other beats out there so a little bit a little bit less forward and therefore a little bit less bloated which is a great thing these sound cleaner but the bass is still not quite perfect like it could be a little bit tighter the low mids are still getting a little bit eclipsed by a lot of the lower bass frequencies from that frequency bleeding and just a little bit of you know congestion down there but otherwise the bass is definitely a big step up from the other beats as well as from the airpods pro there's also an emphasis on cymbals so you're getting a bit of a v shape here where you have a big emphasis on bass and then some pretty obvious highs as well although the highs much like the bass lack a little bit of detail and clarity so i think it's needless to say that these are far from analytical earbuds and they definitely suffer from a little bit of congestion but they sound overall definitely fun and vibrant and you know ready to go for a lot of workouts they're less bloated than a lot of the beats from the past but also much better bass from the airpods pro so i think anybody who like the airpods pro is really going to like these it's definitely a big positive right there for the price though to be honest there are better sounding earbuds out there like for example the sennheiser cx earbuds sound great and are selling at about half the price of these but to be honest the sound quality is not necessarily the focus of beats we all know that beats are really not meant for audiophiles but rather for commuters and athletes and gym goers and anybody else who wants a stylish pair of earbuds that is both comfortable and secure enough for pretty much anything you're doing nowhere in that description did i say the best sounding earbuds out there so you know with that in mind they sound a lot better than a lot of older beats did there is however one big issue with the sound quality that i found with these and maybe it's just this pair i haven't tested other ones but i suspect other earbuds are going to have the same issue and this is an issue with a continuous crackling sound so if you put these in your ear and have no music playing you will hear a crackling and if you play more quiet acoustic music again you are going to notice that crackling if you're listening to more full music that has a lot going on obviously it fades away and you won't hear it but i found that this is not something that is related to anc it's not related to what phone i'm connected to it's not related to any of that no matter what i just i can't seem to get rid of the crackling it's something that bothers me maybe it won't bother you but i wanted to include this in review just in case it happens to your pair as well so overall the microphones are great the sound quality is a big improvement the active noise cancellation well i'll just put it as simply as i can i tried these next to the airpods pro and i can't tell a difference they're both incredible when it comes to active noise cancellation and if you've seen any of my other comparisons on this channel the anc of the enterpods pro has always been if not the best at least very very close to the top of the industry so you're going to get some industry-leading anc on these it's fantastic blocks out tons of different frequencies higher voices lower voices trains planes like no matter what your what's around you these do a fantastic job of blocking that sound out now getting into the next category of software compatibility features stuff like that obviously these are in the apple ecosystem and so you're getting all the apple type stuff you have obviously siri on here a seamless switching between devices but you're also getting a lot of stuff from the android side as well so there is an android app available so unlike the airpods pro if you have an android phone these will not only connect but also be customizable as well of course you're gonna be missing out on some of the h1 stuff like the native siri and and you know seamless switching but but still having that functionality is nice these also have spatial audio which which is fun and cool but but personally i don't really use it so if i have earbuds in and i turn my head and and like the balance changes or like the if the left right's changing i i it just sounds kind of weird to me it weirds me out so i don't i turn that off but if you like it it's there if you want it these also of course have mono mode so you can listen to just one at a time maybe to extend your battery or something like that but if you're worried about hearing your surroundings they also have transparency mode and it sounds again really clean and very realistic almost as if you aren't wearing earbuds at all of course they have an auto play auto pause feature and as i keep mentioning again and again the big one is going to be that seamless switching between apple devices all right so that's my take on the beats fit pro overall these earbuds are basically airpods pro with a better design in my opinion better bass more colors and more android support i think that honestly they'll probably sell extremely well but if you hated airpods for their sound their controls or other appley things you probably aren't gonna like these i personally think that i'll be replacing both my airpods pros with these as well as my jabras when i'm running because these like i said are very secure but these are absolutely not going to be replacing my sennheiser earbuds or mastering dynamics which i'll use for casual listening because they have much better sound quality but other than that overall i think that these are really a great pair of earbuds i'm really really happy that beats is making this improvement here moving in the right direction to get great anc great microphones really great comfort and fit i think that these are going to be a solid recommendation for everything except for that sound quality but what do you think leave a comment below and let me know what you think of the beats fit pro what do you like about these what do you not like are you gonna buy them and as always if you enjoyed this video consider liking and subscribing i'm mike o'brien thanks for watching and i'll see you next time you
Beats Fit Pro Earbuds, do these beats fits pros sound better than the airpods pros well okay y'all so beats or you can also say apple just drop the beats fit pros and i already have them out of the box so one of the main kind of standout features of these versus other earbuds that apple sells is the fact that these do have this wingtip design and this wingtip is kind of built into the body of the kind of the main portion of the earbud and when you look at competitors like the bose quietcomfort earbuds right here you can see that this wing tip not only has like a little space in the middle of it but it's a little bit more kind of i don't want to say flimsy but it's not as rigid um as the ones here on the beast fit pros here and also when you compare these to like the jaybird vista2s here you have that same kind of comparison like we have with the qcs and so ultimately i'm happy that they went with the wingtip design because look most earbuds right now trying to be like the ultra sexy style where they have like a one size fit all solution but what this does do is it doesn't fit everyone well and because you don't have any like moving pieces here to kind of adjust to the inside of people's ears this is kind of what you see what you get and you might not have the best fit and feel but because of this wingtip design you can see that this is going to be able to get in your ear and then depending on what's going on on the inside and whether you have like big ears small ears or medium ears this can change its size to be able to give you that better fit now before these when i need like a pair of earbuds where are they right here when i needed a pair of earbuds that just kind of worked in all situations especially when i'm doing something extremely active and moving around i've been using the beats powerbeats pros here for uh like the last two or three years or so and the great thing about these is that when you hook them around the outside of your ear these aren't going nowhere now they look like you're talking to the secret service but these give you that that secure fit that i really do like but these are a little bit dated so they don't have active noise cancellation transparency modes none of those things that you have with these beats fit pros so wingtip design i am liking it i'm very happy that they went with it and then apple says they've managed to put over like 30 more components inside of these fit pros compared to these studio buds and so it's not a you know big drastic difference but the fact that you have you know more technology inside of it more circuitry and all that other stuff inside of these but they've maintained a very similar look to the studio buzz it's pretty impressive and as far as the look of these buzz too i really do like them i think they look pretty sleek and these are the black versions with the red logo here but these do come in four different colors that you can choose from and i think they look really good in your ear too so let me go ahead and pop these in and one of the things too about these fit pros is that they have this little laser cut micro hole near the acoustic nozzle or just like the tip of the earbuds that's going to be able to help with relieving the pressure that you get for having earbuds inside of your ear and if you've used earbuds for like an hour or two or so you can kind of feel that build up over time but with these um i haven't had any case where i felt uncomfortable and oh let me talk about this because this is kind of important so the way you're supposed to put these in your ears is that you put them in and then you give them a twist up or like towards your face and that helps that wing get situated and allow these to have a comfortable fit but when i was doing my audio comparisons which i'll talk about a little bit later i found that the audio from these was a little too low compared to everything else and i was like what's going on there but i realized that i was twisting them up too far up and i was pulling the earbud out of my ear canal so what i do now is that i push them up and then i push them back like halfway and that gets them seated perfectly and something else i do when i'm putting them in my ears is that i do have my index finger on the wingtip right here because when you do put them in sometimes the wing might actually be on the upper part of your ear but you needed to get it right in this little area and then you can do that twist so just use your index finger to be able to guide that inside of your ear and that works for me and i didn't have that many accidental touches because of the design of these and the fact that you have the space here on the side to grab on to put these in or take them out of your ears but also the the button is this beach logo right here towards the bottom of the earbud where compared to like the b studio buds the button that you need to press in is actually at the top so when you are putting these in your ears um you might be a little bit more prone to like touch the top part of it so it's smart that they move this to the bottom portion of the earbud and because this does have apple's h1 chip inside of them just like the apple airpods pros this does allow you to do an ear tip test and that will give you a little test to be able to let you know which size ear tip that you need to use for your ears because if you didn't know your ears might have different size ear tips that work best with them so being able to run that test allows you to go and use those extra ear tips inside of the box and get the best fit and now let's talk about this case so when you do take the earbuds out of the ears and you put them in the case they have this little magnetic snap that they do and then you do also have this button right here that you need to press to initiate pairing mode but the case itself is actually a pretty decent size but it kind of fits between the airpods pros and also the beats studio buds right here so these aren't as wide as the studio buds case but these definitely um are taller than the airpods pros case so definitely not as pocketable as the airpods pros case but these are definitely a smaller size compared to its bigger brother i would call it the powerbeats pros case here as you can see this thing you just really couldn't take with you on the go or at least like put it in your pocket or something because it was just way too big now this is a battery charging case so let's talk about battery life real quick so when you are using anc or the transparency mode you can get up to 27 hours of listening time so that's six hours with the buzz in your ears but then when you're using the case you get an additional 21 hours but if you do turn both of those off you can get up to 30 hours of listening time so that means seven hours of the earbuds in your ears an additional 23 hours from the case now as far as charging the case and the buds up from zero percent to 100 that's gonna take you about an hour and a half and but if you are in a rush and you have like five minutes or so um that five minute charge can get you up to an hour of listening time with anc on and so i'm happy about the battery life that i get with these compared to other earbuds in this price range but one thing i'm not happy about is that these do not come with wireless charging like the airpods pros or even some 99 earbuds that are out right now so you don't get wireless charging and you also don't even get the option to be able to you know pay a little bit more money to buy a wireless charging case which i wish they did because they do that with their regular airpods so not having wireless charging at this price range definitely something that i want to see in the future but one thing that these do have that you don't really see from a lot of other apple earbuds is really good android support so you can use these with an android phone like this pixel 6 pro here because you can download the beats app and that will allow you to be able to use fast pairing so once you open up the lid for these fits pros you'll see a little notification in the app and a couple of tabs later you'll be paired up to your android phone and then also from here you can customize the different controls for the buttons on the earbuds which you can control individually so you can have the right earbud when you press in and hold activate noise cancellation or change to another mode or on the left earbud you can have it when you press and hold to activate the volume controls or to activate the voice assistant and yes you can use these with the google assistant on your android phone and also in here you can turn on automatic ear detection so when you put them in your ears they'll automatically start playing and the good thing about these fits pros is that they do use skin detection so they will be better at knowing when they're going in your ear versus going in your pocket and then also you can have noise cancellation with only one earbud if for whatever reason you want to do that and so you don't always get that option with earbuds so it's nice to see that and so it's good to see apple embrace the android side of the world at least with their beats products but if you want the best experience the most seamless experience between all of your apple devices of course you're going to need to use these with the iphone so you have all of the access to all of those features as i showed you before and so because of that h1 chip you do have that fast pairing or quick pairing i can't remember what they call it but anyway open up the lid in the case of these buds and then you can get them paired up quickly and then when you pull down the control center you have the access to the volume controls and also switching between the different audio modes and you can also control the spatial audio support that these do have like the airpods pros but also unlike these b studio bus that don't have that feature and you can change up the eq for these but only when you're using them with like the apple music app so you can go into the settings app and then go to music and then you'll be able to change that eq but also too when you go into the bluetooth settings you can find the earbuds hit that little i button and that will allow you to access all of those different settings that i talked about before in the beats android app but now let's talk about audio quality and i know what you want to know do these beats fits pros sound better than the airpods pros well yes and i always say yes because 30 of the time i do like the sound signature on these versus the airpods pros and and the other 70 they sound pretty even to me but i really like the way the bass and the low end sounds on these when i listen to certain types of hip hop and also too and even when i'm listening to like han zimmer i just feel like the audio signature that you get with these is it's just a little bit better than the airpods pros and look those airpods pros have been out for a while now and these are the new hotness um but beats has definitely done a really good job with the transducers inside of here that are definitely bigger than the ones that come with the beats studio pros and then because of that h1 chip inside of these you do have spatial audio as i mentioned before so this enables things for like head tracking when you're watching a movie or listening to music which is kind of cool to do once or twice because it uses the accelerometers and the gyroscopes inside of the earbuds and also your phone to be able to track the position of your head and your phone which again is cool to do once but i usually use spatial audio in the stationary mode where basically you're just able to use the apple music app on your iphone or even android and that just gives you that really good audio experience and it makes it sounds like you're just in the room while they're making the music and when you aren't using anc or transparency mode the adaptive eq kicks in for these and that's basically going to be using the inward facing microphones on these earbuds so they're going to be listening to the inside of your ear and kind of like measuring the sound waves as they bounce around your ear to just adapt that eq to give you the best sound that it thinks you want to hear now when it comes to things like anc and transparency mode though i will give the nod to the airpods pros in those two categories only slightly though when i wasn't doing side by side comparisons i am perfectly happy with both of those modes on these fitz pros but just compared to the airpods pros i just feel like those were a little bit better in those two things but i will say that in these two modes these are better than the b studio buds though if you do want to know about that comparison all right so now the audio that you're hearing is coming from these beat fits pros and i'm giving you a sense of how they might sound if you are on a phone call so i'm walking down this alley so one nobody can see me wearing them but two so you can get a little bit of sense of the wind resistance that it does have so apple says they've done a good job to try to eliminate the noise of wind and stuff when you are wearing these and on a phone call but yeah let me know what you think and how they sound down in the comments below and so look the airpods pros have been out for a little while and what we're seeing is just the technology catch up especially for lower prices compared to them and i think it's about time for apple to release some new airpods pros but for right now if you're looking for a pair of earbuds like these fit pros that just give you the best of both worlds whether you're using android or ios you get that spatial audio you get a nc you get that good transparency mode and you get really good sound quality i think for 200 bucks these are a really good deal but for right now out of all of the apple earbuds i will be using these the most because of that wingtip it gives me that secure fit in my ear and i know they aren't going anywhere when i'm working out and stuff and oh these are rated for ipx4 for like water resistance and things so yeah these will be my workout earbuds these will be when i'm going hiking and stuff um because you have that wingtip that gives you that secure fit and that's also a really big advantage over the airpods pros because for me they always kind of move around a little bit in my ears and when that happens that means that you're not going to be getting that best sound quality because the ear tip is not going to be in the right position in your ear but with these you don't have to worry about that i mean these are very unlikely to move around when you get them inside of your ear and you're going to be less likely to have to go buy third-party ear tips and things to get that perfect fit i think these are going to fit a lot of people nicely so yeah these are just my thoughts about the beats fits pros let me know what you think down below in that comment section also smash that subscribe button and that notification bell if you like this content and you want to see other stuff that i do and also hit that like button too but like always i do want to thank you for watching this video and i'll catch you later peace
AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds, [Music] all right I'll be honest I wasn't even planning on reviewing these you know it's Tech Timber there's there's a lot of stuff going on right now like there's other videos on other Tech that we're actively working on that's coming soon that you'll see so you know we saw the new airpods announcement in the keynote and the couple new features and then Apple sent over a pair it's got my memoji on it and everything I was like that's cute but I promise you I didn't even take it out the box for a few days because I was so busy working on some of the other stuff but then I did take it out the box and I did try them and I gotta say I I am now very convinced that these are really good but not by what you think so there's a lot of small new features here that airpods people have been waiting for for a long time on the surface it's still in a nearly identical design you recognize them from a mile away the only way you can tell them apart from the last airpods Pro visually is by these dual vents at the top but on the inside there is an entirely new driver and amplifier and these airpods do sound dramatically better than the last ones easily the best sounding earbuds Apple's ever made there are way more lows and mids so if you listen to Hip Hop or just music with a lot of bass it's very noticeable it's just way better and there's also very little high volume Distortion and just the whole sound profile is very responsive and crisp they sound good like really good earpods now there still is no lossless audio with these but it's still 16 bit 48 kilohertz audio and that is good but that wasn't the thing that convinced me it was a Difference Maker for sure it's really nice but that's not the thing these do now have a 33 longer battery life so it's six hours on a single charge now with noise cancellation on and up to 30 total hours with the battery in the case I promise you I'll never have earbuds in for six hours straight so this was more than enough for me but it wasn't what impressed me either there is also a new extra small ear tip so now it comes with the mediums installed by default and then there's two sizes smaller and one larger size so if you had smaller ears that the previous airpods didn't quite work with these may make a difference for you with the extra small ear tip as you can imagine that's not me mediums all the way but some maybe even tempted to say that the new case is the biggest upgrade that's certainly what I thought when I watched the keynote it's like apple had a meeting about how wow people are losing these things and getting them mixed up with other people's airpods and then they just decided to do something about it so the case is the same size and shape but there's this lanyard loop on the side now in case you want to attach it to something it's kind of like the loop on the top of the water bottle at mkbhd.com but just way smaller and then you can use whatever language you want to attach it to but if that's not good enough for you there's a whole speaker at the bottom of the case now and it is surprisingly useful so it can play a loud sound to help you find them on top of the Precision finding that already works really well since it has a U1 chip inside so it's just like an air tag if it's somewhere in your general vicinity it can guide you to it that is sweet it also plays a sound when you get it on a charger wired or Wireless and the magsafe ring helps it stay in place on any magsafe wireless charging puck that's not new but it also now works with Apple watch Chargers too which is a nice touch on top of all that it is still ipx4 water resistant which is an extra layer of security if you work out and sweat around the case or if you end up in the rain in these and you can engrave it with your memoji now so your friends will never accidentally pick up your airpods case by mistake but not even that is what was convincing me about the airpods pro 2. not even the most requested feature apparently this is something lots of other earbuds have had but volume control on the earbud itself it's on the stock now so of course it is now much more convenient to just adjust the volume without having to reach for your phone it's kind of like this pinch gesture where you hold your finger on one side and then slide with the other on the flat spot on the stock it's kind of awkward at first but you do get used to it but no it was none of that the thing that convinced me with these headphones that they are incredible is the H2 chip so previous years generations of Apple headphones have had the H1 chip inside and it's this little chip that's doing the audio processing noise cancellation Etc this is the second generation of that chip and apple is bragging on stage that it has like a billion transistors or something ridiculous whatever the point of the chip is that it enables everything that is special about these new airpods so first of all there is much improved active noise cancellation Apple said something like up to two times more background noise is removed versus the last generation I don't know about all that but combining these new drivers and the sound profile with the improved noise cancellation is definitely noticeable I mean it's incredible with white noise like air conditioners and transportation you put the headphones on and it just erases them immediately like I'm not the type of person to wear earbuds for an entire flight I still much prefer over-the-ear headphones for that but I get it with these now I understand why people would want to wear these earbuds on a plane because they cancel is that well I'm putting them on the same level of like the Sony mark IV earbuds and right below the new Bose quiet Comfort earbud twos and I put them above the airpods Maxes as far as how well it actually cancels sound I mean they still sound very different I did the back to back test don't get me wrong you can tell the much bigger driver makes a difference in the airpods max but these get quieter they remove more background noise now there is already a lot of computational audio happening in airpods Pro Sound they're literally adjusting the EQ with everything you listen to and across every different volume level to make sure they sound a certain way which is kind of funny it actually makes them hard to review sometimes against other headphones because every track hits a little bit different but the one huge Advantage airpods have had for a long time now over the competition over the poses and the Samsungs and the pixel buds of the world is the transparency mode as someone who has used them all like the transparency mode from airpods has for a while been on a level by itself Above the Rest the real-time pass-through of outside sound is kind of amazing and in these with the H2 chip it is leveled up again so on stage Apple introduced what they're calling adaptive transparency mode it's actually not a separate mode it's still the transparency mode which is with a different name but what's happening is it's still passing through all the outside sound but anytime there's a loud or a harsh sound above 85 decibels it cuts that sound down to not be loud and harsh so let's say you're walking or biking through the city you need to keep transparency mode on so you can hear the cars and the people around you for safety but you're still listening to music or a podcast or whatever and then an ambulance drives past you Sirens blaring you will still hear the sirens but that super loud sound will be suppressed to a level that doesn't hurt your ears it's just it's super smart like and that ambulance could be anything that could be uh someone honking it could be a jackhammer construction noise it could be a dog barking but it's keeping it's keeping the same sound signature of whatever sound that is and just bringing it down below a certain level and it's doing it all in real time with virtually no DeLay So the crazy number is it's sampling outside sound 48 000 times per second apparently that's 240 times faster than the last generation and so it could even be like a really sharp like quick outside sound like a dog barking it will actually reduce a loud dog barking as fast as it's actually happening so by the time it reaches your ears it's a lower degree of sound it's crazy now I've been trying it I've been walking around with them and it's working really well it's so good that this is this is a real situation a scenario that I've dreamed up that I believe could happen I haven't tried this myself but you know how you typically go to a super loud concert and like front row middle row like the speakers are obviously too loud they're damaging your ears if you have an Apple Watch it's giving you like you know warnings that you if you're in this type of sound for too long it'll be damaging to your hearing instead of wearing earplugs you can actually you can really do this you can wear airpods Pro 2 and put them in transparency mode and it will take the entire sound signature of that whole thing you're listening to and it will drop it down to a reasonable level you'll still feel the bass in your chest of the speakers but your hearing won't be damaged as much because it's taking all of that and reducing it and you're still hearing the music that's incredible so all this real-time processing is happening on the earbuds not on your phone and that is the H2 chip at work plus there's also a few other features it enables too it talks to the noise app on the Apple watch in real time to show you how much noise is being canceled out in case you want a visual for that sort of thing and also if you accidentally ever put the wrong earbud in your case like someone else's the speaker will actually play a chime and you'll get a mismatched airpods notification on your phone another nice touch for those people who have inevitably lost airpods to their friends cases and probably don't even know it and then there's a new ear scan for personalized spatial audio this was kind of a weird one so it's using the face ID depth sensors to measure your head and measure the depth of your ears to give you a personalized spatial audio mix Sony's been doing the same thing for a little bit with some of their headphones they use the front-facing camera I don't know if I was uh convinced that the usefulness of this I mean the spatial audio was already pretty good but after I did the personalized audio basically for me it just sounded like the Sound Stage got a little bit wider maybe like there's just a bit more of a spread to how far apart the different sounds and instrumentals are I don't know exactly how much of the ear scan data was being used for this but that's even more computational audio thanks to the H2 chip overall though these airpods are a significant upgrade and they're just flat out better than I expected I wasn't expecting this much of a change and they sound way better they work way better there is still lots of other competition in the in the earbuds World Samsung's buds are really good I also really like the pixel buds I did a whole separate video review of those if you want to watch it you can check it out with the card but at the beginning of the video I said a little phrase I don't know if you caught it but I said airpods people airpods people and this is something that you might see a lot if you live in a major city or where there's a lot of mass transit or something like that it's it's when people just wear air pods everywhere they go like they walk around the streets with them they bike around they just live with airpods in their ears and these are going to be amazing for those people like it's everything you'd care about it's the better battery life it's the better sound quality it's the better noise cancellation and much better transparency mode the better case the volume control on the stocks all in one package at the same price I get it I get it it's really good airpods Pro 2 really really good and now you know why all right that's it thanks for watching catch in the next one peace [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds, [Music] hey there ever since the airpods Pro 2 were first announced on September 7th for 249 dollars people keep asking me so how much better are they than the originals well putting an exact percentage on how much they've improved isn't so easy but that's what I'm gonna try to do in this review I'm also going to try to give you an idea how they stack up against some of the other top new earbuds out there here we go let's start with the external design this is one of those situations where Apple hasn't really done anything to change the size and shape of the buds for significantly alter their physical appearance the original airpods Pro were compact and lightweight and fit a lot of people's ears really well so I can't fault that decision some people were hoping for shorter stems perhaps some new color options or even better water resistance yes they're still ipx4 Splash proof but I figured Apple would stick with its tried and true design and focus on making improvements to the airs that had the most room for improvement like sound quality noise canceling performance and battery life which is now up to six hours from about 4.5 hours with noise canceling on there are some small but noteworthy changes to the design particularly to the microphones placement on the original airpods Pro the skin detection sensor and noise canceling microphone were combined on the inside of the bud now they're separated with the skin detection sensor in the same spot but the noise canceling microphone has been moved to the top of the Bud where it's exposed to the outside world and better at picking up and processing Ambient sound the microphone configuration is similar to what you see on the airpods 3 but the skin detection sensor is actually smaller and apple says it's improved the sensor to more accurately turns on and off playback and is more energy efficient I should also mention that Apple now includes a four set of extra small ear tips which should help those of you with really small ears who had trouble getting a secure fit with the originals but this isn't like the third generation airpods where Apple made big changes to the earbuds external design as far as I can tell these fit my ears the same as the originals I personally would like apple included a new extra large ear tip but I do get a relatively good seal with the largest size that is included I could probably do just a little bit better with an XL tip and I sometimes use third-party foam tips to get a more secure fit they have a little bit more grip and that helps keep the buds very securely in my ears particularly when I'm running with them the new magsafe enabled wireless charging case is the same size but now has a built-in speaker and Apple's U1 chip which allows it to play sounds for use with Apple's Precision find my feature previously the buds could play a sound through their drivers but often they were in the case so you couldn't hear that sound now you can use find my to locate the case or the left or right earbuds separately should one or all of them go missing case also now has a spot for attaching a lanyard but sadly Apple doesn't include a lanyard with the buds while Apple has retained the pinch controls on the stems which I preferred to the touch controls on the original airpods it's now added swipe controls on the stems for adjusting the volume you can still ask Siri to raise and lower the volume these do have hands-free Siri but a lot of people will appreciate the new swipe controls that's really it as far as external design changes go and most of them are tied into some feature or performance enhancement as I said my initial first look video the real changes are on the inside where everything is basically new the airpods Pro 2 are powered by Apple's new H2 chip which delivers more processing power while being more energy efficient to get better sound apples combine that chip with a new amplifier and new low Distortion drivers along with new digital processing algorithms the H2 new microphones and algorithms are also what Drive the improved adaptive active noise canceling that Apple says is double as powerful as its predecessors noise canceling and finally there's a new adaptive transparency mode that allows you to hear the world around you in a natural lifelike manner while reducing loud noises that might normally shock your ears it's a great transparency mode and you can turn off the Adaptive part if you want you can definitely hear the improvements to both the noise canceling and the sound as for the sound you get better Clarity more bass punch with better definition than just more all-around depth and dynamic sound the sound just has a little more girth and three-dimensionality to it I compared a few tracks I always use during testing like spoons knock knock knock and you can really notice a difference in the Bass Performance one of the more impressive things about the buzz is how loud they play for me anyway I found they played plenty loud at about 65 to 70 volume I compared them to the new Bose quiet Comfort earbuds 2 the airpods Pro 2 sound excellent but there's something about the tonal balance of the bows that I liked a little better at times there's a little bit more warmth than naturalness to it and the bass has a bit more oomph but on the Bose I had to push the volume up to about 85 percent to hear some of the finer details and to get that extra bass kick with the airpods Pro 2 you hear more detail and get good bass even at more moderate volume levels I will say that the noise canceling is impacted by how tight of seal you get from the ear tips that said it was easy to sense that it was reducing more cab noise during a flight I took and also muffled more sound when I rode the subway in New York the buds also have just enough venting to avoid that oppressive occluded feeling you sometimes get with ANC buds the noise canceling didn't feel twice as strong to me but by double the noise canceling power what apple means is the noise canceling is improved across all frequencies and probably more so with high and mid-range frequencies that are harder to muffle than lower frequencies so you're likely to hear more improvement with the muffling of people's voices for example the noise canceling is one of the best out there right now and just a slight step behind what experience with Bose's new quiet Comfort earbuds too which arguably have the best noise canceling at the moment some people were hoping that the new airpods Pro would be able to stream apple lossless tracks over Bluetooth they currently can't do that which will certainly disappoint some people whether they will be able to do that in the future and possibly get other new feature upgrades is anybody's guess but for now they use Bluetooth 5.3 and support the AAC lc3 audio codec which offers 16-bit 48 kilohertz bit rates compared to the 16-bit 24 kilohertz bit rates of AAC not high resolution audio but a little bump up I'm not going to talk much about Apple's spatial audio virtual surround mode but it's here and fun to play around with I prefer using it with movies but I also try to with various music tracks particularly those that apple designates as made for spatial audio it doesn't necessarily make music sound better but it does make it sound different it's interesting to try it out with tracks you know well and want to hear in a different way iOS 16 brings personalized spatial audio to any airpods that support spatial audio the personalized experience comes from taking pictures of your ears and the biggest benefit is the more accurate placement of dialogue directly in front of you when you're watching a movie that placement doesn't move even if you turn your head the original airpods Pro were very good for making voice calls and so were these as I said the microphones have been upgraded and there are two beam forming microphones for calls one on the outside of the bud and one on the bottom of the stem both of which have some mesh covering them to help reduce wind noise when you're using the buds to make a FaceTime call over Wi-Fi instead of a call over a cellular network but the audio gets compressed people may be able to notice a bigger difference in the clarity of your voice compared to what they would hear with the original airpods Pro but have a listen to the test call we made on Verizon cellular network all right on the streets of New York doing a test call with fellow editor John Falcone how do I sound John there's a lot of traffic around me there's a little bit of wind before but there's definitely a lot of traffic so if you're outside and surrounded by a lot of traffic I'd say you sound very good to excellent I hear a tiny bit of that in the background but uh can hear your voice nice and clearly and then um just a very clear experience on my end for the most part all right I'm going to talk a little bit more so you get a sample of my voice as I'm talking as traffic is going by uh there isn't as much wind as it was before so it can't fall but at least so that but this is what my voice sounds like on the airpods Pro to making a call as I said in the beginning it's hard to put an exact number on just how much better the new airpods Pro 2 are compared to their predecessor but I'm going to go with somewhere around 40 percent the fact is that when the airpods pro came out almost three years ago it was really their compact size comfortable fit and Apple only features like Auto switching being all the devices on your iCloud account that were their big selling points that's all here still but now the sound and noise canceling which were good but not great before are what you'd expect from a 249 dollar set of earbuds audio quality is very subjective and some people may slightly prefer the Sonic traits of buzz like the bows I mentioned earlier but the Sony wf-1000x mark IV or sennheiser's momentum true Wireless 3 all of which have equalizer options in their companion apps but others may actually prefer the airpod Pro 2 sound it really does stack up well against what you get with other premium earbuds in this price range and it's particularly impressive considering how small and lightweight the earbuds are they'll pair with Android devices but you do lose a lot of their special features including spatial audio so Android users are going to be better off with buds like Google's pixel buds Pro or Samsung's Galaxy buds 2 Pro or the Bose I mentioned earlier and you may find that other buds like the Bose or even Apple's own Beats fit Pro which don't sound quite as good or offer quite as good noise canceling or voice calling performance may fit your ears more securely You may wish Apple had made the airpods Pro 2 look a little different than the originals and while they may not quite be perfect they feel like a more fully evolved refined product it's pretty hard to beat for Apple users so long as they fit your ears we have links in the description to some of the products I've mentioned and you can watch their videos here and for those of you who decide to buy a pair of airpods Pro 2 let me know in the comment section just how much you think they've improved and what you think they could do better finally if you found this video informative at all hit the like

AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds, quite frankly I'm surprised that apple is able to get away with this back in September of 2020 Apple released their iOS 14 update which essentially turned their airpods Pro into hearing aids of course at that time I did a detailed review on the airpods pro to see how good they were at amplifying sound for individuals with a mild to moderate hearing loss and to be honest they did pretty well in fact I had numerous individuals bring their airpods Pro into my clinic for us to optimize them after seeing my review video and several of these individuals did experience a relatively good amount of success with these devices well since that time Apple has released their new airpods Pro 2 that has these same features that allow you to turn your air pods into hearing aids now technically speaking the airpods pro and airpods pro 2 are not hearing aids and they are not over-the-counter hearing aids now I'm not exactly sure how apple is able to skirt around the over-the-counter hearing aid guidelines that were established at the end of 2022 but I guess as long as they never Market these as hearing aids or over-the-counter hearing aids they can get away without having any regulation on these devices regardless since they quite obviously have some hearing aid capabilities I went ahead and decided to review these just like I would any other over-the-counter hearing aid device the airpods Pro 2 used the new H2 chip as opposed to the airpods pro that just used the H1 chip Apple claims that this new chip gives the airpods Pro 2 better active noise cancellation better noise reduction and better Acoustics while the appearance of the Apple airpods Pro 2 and the Apple airpods Pro are nearly identical the Apple airpods Pro 2 now come with an extra small earbud tip as far as the smaller earbuds go that will help out certain individuals with smaller ear canals but for myself I use the size medium and these fit my ears like a glove I absolutely love them in fact from a physical fit perspective I found the airpods Pro 2 to be some of the most comfortable earbuds that I've ever worn that being said if you previously had issues with the way your airpods pro fit your ears you're going to continue to have that problem with the airpods Pro 2 unless the smaller earbud helps you out personally from a comfort standpoint I could wear these all day long which brings me to my next point which is Apple did extend the battery life on the airpods Pro 2 which is very helpful the original airpods Pro would give you four and a half hours of battery life if you use them as hearing aids and the airpods Pro 2 will now give you six hours of battery life honestly that extra one and a half hours is helpful but you would still have to get yourself a second pair of these devices if you wanted to wear the airpods pro too as hearing aids all day long of course at only 249 dollars for a pair of Apple airpods Pro 2. you could buy yourself two pairs of these devices and still spend less money than you would for a decent pair of over-the-counter hearing aids that'll run you right around a thousand dollars alright guys hopefully you're enjoying this video so far trust me we are going to get more technical with the airpods pro 2. but if you could do me a huge favor click that like button really helps out my channel and it encourages me to make more review videos just like this one and while you're at it if you have not yet hit that subscribe button with notification Bell go ahead and do that as well I greatly appreciate it that being said let's get back to the review all right let's go ahead and take a look at how to turn your airpods Pro 2 into hearing aids so you can better hear sounds around you and so you can hear streaming better right off the bat you need to pair your airpods Pro 2 to your Apple iPhone and yes you do need an iPhone if you want to enable these headphone accommodations to turn your airpods Pro 2 into hearing aids if you do not have an iPhone but you have a friend who has an iPhone you can technically use their iPhone to turn your devices into hearing aids and then give their phone back to them because the air pods will actually store the settings that you put in them once you get them paired the next thing you need to do is upload your professional audiogram thresholds into your iPhone or download the Mimi hearing app and take a hearing test that will upload automatically to do this make sure that your airpods Pro 2 are either paired to your phone or your iPad and you have them in your ears then you will want to go to settings scroll down to accessibility scroll down to Audio Visual headphone accommodations custom audio setup click continue and either select a previously entered audiogram or enter a new audiogram if you have a professional hearing test you can use your iPhone camera to upload your audiogram and it will automatically enter thresholds for you but this is incredibly inaccurate so I would recommend entering your thresholds Yourself by hand the next best thing would be to download the Mimi hearing test app and take the hearing test through your iPhone once you've got your audiogram uploaded you can either use your custom settings based on your audiogram results or you can use the standard settings next this brings up the section where you can customize your transparency mode where you can adjust your overall amplification levels your transparency balance between your left and right air pods your tone controls between darker and brighter your ambient noise reduction and toggle conversation boost on or off to test the Apple airpods Pro 2 I once again Enlisted the help of my assistant Brie who has a mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss which happens to fall within the capabilities of the airpods pro 2. to perform realer measurement we place probe micro phone tubes inside of Bree's ear canals and measure the amount of amplification that she receives from the airpods pro 2. we can also measure things like directionality and noise reduction with this method first we measured Bree's ear canal resonance which is indicated by the solid pink curve this allows us to see the natural amplification effect that her ear canal creates without using any amplification devices however in order for Bree to hear her best we would want the solid pink curve to match the hash mark pink curve which is her Nal nl2 hearing loss prescription obviously with a mild to moderate hearing loss she will need some amplification in order to accomplish this second we place the airpods Pro 2 into Breeze ears and measure the initial amplification levels indicated by the solid red curve to see how close they came to matching her prescription which is the red hash mark curve as you can see the airpods Pro 2 did a horrible job of matching her prescription above 1000 Hertz on their initial settings based on her entered audio videogram essentially leaving her significantly under Amplified which would provide her with little to no benefit using these devices if you compare the solid red curve with the solid pink curve you can see that the airpods Pro 2 provided little to no amplification across the frequency range on this default setting third we attempted to customize the transparency settings to Bree's prescription this time using a turquoise curve after several attempts of modifying the amplification levels transparency balance and tone settings this is as close as we got while this is much better than before you can see that we are still not meeting her hearing loss prescription above 3000 Hertz which would ultimately cause her to struggle with Clarity and speech fourth to fully test the capabilities of the airpods Pro 2 we set the tone control to darker which increased low frequency amplification while at the same time decreasing high frequency amplification the same type of offset occurs when you shift it over to brighter now be careful when you shift it over to darker because while that might sound a little bit more natural to you it actually can create a phenomenon called upward spread of masking which can drown out the clarity from the high frequencies I do have an entire video explaining the concept of upward spread of masking so if you're interested in it go ahead and check it out fifth I wanted to measure compression settings to see if soft sounds were being Amplified enough to be Audible and if loud sounds were being reduced enough to be comfortable starting with the loud level compression in turquoise we can see that the airpods Pro 2 do a pretty good job at reducing amplification given to loud sounds so they do not become too loud but as we check the soft level compression in green we can see that we are missing prescriptive targets all over the place which means that Brie would continue to struggle with soft talkers and struggle to hear soft speech components sixth we tested the conversation boost feature which is designed to use directionality to prioritize speech coming from the front while reducing sounds coming from the back if this feature works we would expect to see the solid red curve which is sound coming from the front to be higher on the graph than the solid turquoise curve which is sound coming from the rear clearly this conversation boost feature works and works really well I might add seventh I wanted to measure the ambient noise reduction capabilities of the airpods pro 2. to do this we play a steady state pink noise and see how many decibels of noise reduction occurs first we turn this feature to its lowest setting and measured only three decibels of noise reduction next we set it to the medium setting and measured a respectable eight decibels of noise reduction finally we set the ambient noise reduction to maximum and measured between 9 and 10 decibels of noise reduction finally I wanted to compare the optimal airpods Pro 2 settings in red with Breeze prescription hearing aid settings and purple as you can see while the airpods Pro 2 settings are respectable Breeze prescription hearing aids do a much better job of matching the hash mark prescriptive targets meaning that her prescription and hearing aids still do a better job of optimizing her ability to hear while they were definitely not perfect at being able to match a mild to moderate hearing loss prescription for average level speech and soft level speech for a pair of devices that cost only 249 dollars they did much better than I expected I was also very pleased to see that the conversation boost feature worked really well as well as the noise reduction settings even though I was not able to measure much more noise reduction from the Midway point up to the maximum Point as far as my other thoughts about using the Apple airpods Pro 2 as hearing aids I like that you can also apply the audiogram tuning to both phone calls and other media streaming in addition to the transparency mode this means that you should also be able to understand people better on the phone as well as hear music better and other stream media better the stability of the Bluetooth connection between the airpods Pro 2 and your smartphone is second to none and they definitely outperform any other hearing aid that's out on the market when it comes to Bluetooth stability you can also use the live listen features to turn your iPhone phone into a remote microphone to learn more about this feature you need to watch Dr Rachel Cook's video about turning your airpods pro into spy devices when it's all said and done are the airpods Pro 2 as good as prescription hearing aids the answer to that is clearly no but would they be a viable option to provide you with benefit if you have a mild to moderate hearing loss even though they are not an over-the-counter hearing aid the answer to that is clearly yes so if you're on the fence about doing something to treat your hearing loss the fastest and cheapest way for you to get started maybe to get yourself a pair of Apple airpods Pro 2.
AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds, it's been six months since I bought Apple's airpods Pro 2 and I wanted to give you guys an updated long-term review on both the good and the bad and if you should buy a discounted brand new set for as low as 189 dollars right now on Amazon links down below or if you should just wait for the airpods Pro 3 and when those will be coming out now I want to start out with the things that really surprised me and what I changed my mind on the first are the updated controls now the airpods Pro 2 look very similar to the original models which I really liked but one new feature is the ability to swipe on the stem to adjust your volume when that came out I thought it was a little bit gimmicky I didn't think that I would use it but then once I started to use it I found myself just using it naturally without even thinking about it and I'm somebody that has an Apple watch Ultra so I can just swipe to adjust the volume but the now playing app isn't always open or sometimes they don't have it on my wrist so that has been amazing not having to even touch my phone and the next one has been reliability with the original airpods Pros I constantly had issues where sometimes they would auto switch sometimes they wouldn't sometimes it would take 10 20 seconds or I would even have to turn off Bluetooth and then reconnect it the last six months these things have been solid now I'm not sure if that is just the new H2 chip with the Bluetooth 5.3 that my iPhone 14 pro Max also has but it has been solid switching to my Mac has been very quick and it is so nice to not have bugs that are just annoying you when you know the way that they should actually work and the third thing that really surprised me was the Apple watch charger compatibility now I love the Apple added mag and it's into this so you can charge it with mag safe and it aligns and then when they added the Apple watch charger I thought that was weird I want Apple to go away from their own standard for the Apple watch just to go to a standard Qi because I don't like to have a specific charger but I have found myself many times where I needed to charge this and I had an Apple Watch charger I keep one in my car or my desk I simply just set it down and it charges or even in my three in one just setting it down uh into the wrong spot at night and then I realize it but it charges anyway so that is a nice touch now the next thing I want to talk about is battery life it has been incredible now the battery life did get a little bit better with these new models but in the real world what I have noticed is that I have never ran out of battery using these I think Apple under quoted them I think there's a little bit of extra capacity for long term long longevity because if you didn't know if your battery dies too fast the maximum capacity Apple will need to replace these if you're under warranty and with that they have the optimized charging feature which I have kept enabled so even though I use these all the time I don't think they've degraded at all whereas with the previous airpods I would have them die on me and even after six months to a year it was noticeable that the batteries were not lasting that long now because of that I don't know if you really need Apple Care Plus I would always buy them for earpods one of the only Apple devices that I would buy AppleCare for because I knew the battery degraded so quickly that you would need to replace it but with these updates you might not need to at least if you're very careful and you don't lose these now Apple also added the find me functionality basically an air tag built in and that is an amazing feature that is well worth upgrading in my opinion yet now I'm not somebody that loses these very often but that has come in handy one time for me and the fact that we have a speaker here for it to make noises for you to find him is great but what I like even more is when I do set them down to charge just to have that little chime notification for me to know that yes they are charging that my charger is plugged in is super nice and with that I have to talk about noise cancellation it is phenomenal so much so that in my last few times flying I have literally not taken my airpods Max these things were great before great on a plane but I think with a lot of frequencies the airpods Pro 2 are actually better and they fit in your pocket they're very comfortable they're less expensive so when you combine all the convenience and the fact that the noise cancellation is so good um that is just a killer selling point for these and a killer reason to upgrade now as far as transparency mode in my microphone quality Apple's always had amazing transparency mode but now it is even better because of the feature called adaptive transparency where when you're using them if you have transparency mode on and there's a loud sound outside it will actually lower the volume so now I'm doing yard work it is amazing and it's a nice little safety feature to protect your ears and that way I could be doing things I could still hear my kids if I turn off the blower and then when I turn it back on it lowers the volume I think that it's a great feature that nobody really expected that Apple added and it was awesome now with that when I originally compared these to the airpods 3 the airpods 3 actually did a little bit better in terms of microphone quality now I don't know if Apple has improved it with software updates but one thing that has been great is the voice isolation feature that they added that you can use with airpods Pro 2 as well now that cancels out background sounds take makes your voice and kind of isolates it so that's what it's sending to whoever you're talking to and using that feature even in loud environments paired with the microphones that are in here makes for pretty much the best um experience using bluetooth earbuds for making phone calls and now we have to talk about sound quality Apple made a really big jump with these they adjusted the sound profile a lot of audio files even like snazzy Labs said it was a really big upgrade the airpods pro Originals they were really behind compare the competition even the airpods 3 sounded better in a lot of ways but these did step it up and I think one reason they did is because of that H2 chip and uh the fact that the spatialized audio worked so much better they added that feature where you can personalize it and I was really surprised by how big of a difference that made I don't know how how that Tech Works where it looks at your ears and it Tunes it but it does work and now for most songs I'm keeping spatialized audio turned on it makes songs sound like you're at a live concert you hear the vocals clearly it expands The Sound Stage it works really well and that made me want to have spatialized audio in my car and then anchor released a speaker that is Bluetooth and has a spatialized audio as well and that does a great job and particularly if you're listening to lower quality audio when you're streaming if you're playing through YouTube it makes low quality audio quite a bit better so that was impressive now I also love how loud these get especially if you're listening to something quiet like a podcast or something else having the extra room to turn it up is really nice and that is where some other earbuds kind of fall behind uh and a downside with many of them so I'm really glad that Apple gives you that extra room there even though you can get a warning that says hey you're listening to stuff too loud I like that you have that now where do these kind of fall apart now first off we have that lightning Port that is getting more and more annoying as more devices have USB type c thankfully we have wireless charging and the fact that we don't have any better codec for lossless we've talked about this a lot in the past um but Apple did not add it to these and that was a big disappointment whereas with different other earbuds and with Android we now have high-res audio streaming capabilities same thing with that anchor speaker that I talked about and that does improve the quality especially if you're using Apple music with their lossless to stream so it is shocking that apple does not support their own high quality streaming service with their own products so I said a lot of good things about these should you wait for the airpods pro 3. well we recently had some leaks and some code where we have new airpods and a new case that showed up some people are saying they are the airpods Pro 3 but I personally don't think so now I do think that we might have an update in the fall but if we have an update the only change will be USB type c I believe everything else will stay the same we've also had rumors about airpods light a cheaper version that's going to be more affordable so I think that's a possibility but that will not come this year and of course it will not have all of these features so should you wait for airpods Pro 3 and when will those come out well Apple's typically been on about a two-year cycle sometimes reaching up to three to update so if we get airpods Pro 3 it will not be this fall it will be at least another year after that so that means you're gonna be waiting a year and a half and I do not think that is worth it at all especially when you can pick these up as low as 100 189 dollars on Amazon I don't think it's worth the wait pick one up even if has a lightning Port you have wireless charging it works great and overall these are probably the best earbuds that I've ever bought the sound quality is amazing um I rarely use my airpods Max now because of that and I think you'll be extremely happy with it so hopefully you guys enjoyed that update let me know your thoughts as if you bought them how are you enjoying them click that Circle above to subscribe check out one of those videos right over there

AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds, [Music] after spending two months with the airpods Pro 2 I'm really surprised at how much I like these wireless earbuds from the improvements to sound quality over the originals to longer lasting battery life and an even better fit than before it all adds up to a great all-round experience now they're not perfect but I think for many people they're going to come pretty darn close in this video we're going to explore what they like to use every day and I'll share some tips and tricks that I found to get the most out of these wireless earbuds so whether you've also been using them for the same amount of time as me or you've been wanting to find out more about how they hold up long term well let's Dive In for my fellow small ear Brigade the airpods Pro 2 fit so much better than the first generation okay so the physical design hasn't really changed but the difference is there's now an extra small ear tip size which quite frankly has been a game changer for me in terms of getting these to fit really well finally they stay in my ears even when I'm working out without needing to reposition them constantly and push them in throughout the day so on the first generation airpods Pro I would always need to use third-party foam tips now don't get me wrong these are absolutely great and Incredibly functional so I could always get a really secure fit but it is an extra cost on top of the earbuds themselves and of course there is a little bit more effort required to sort of pinch and insert those memory foam tips rather than just popping them in with the default silicon tips and sometimes depending on the size and design of the tips they do need a little bit more adjusting to get them to sit in the charging case properly now I got my wish for extra small ear tips but I just hope that there is an option for Apple to add an extra large ear tip size as I know that there are many people on the other end of the ear canal Spectrum who also need a different fit from those included four sizes now if you're on the fence about upgrading from the original airpods Pro and you also have small ears well you don't necessarily have to spend big just to get that better fit because the good news is I found those extra small second generation tips actually fit on the first generation airpods Pro and they cost eight dollars from Apple directly for two sets many airpods users myself included have been asking for volume controls on the stem and Apple has delivered with the second generation but I do find the precise finger placement is key and for me it's taken a little bit more time to get used to this than I would have liked look maybe it's a fat fingers issue but even after two months I still don't get it right all the time and I accidentally end up going through the stem itself rather than where you should be swiping on which is the force sensor so I do actually find it a little bit easier to make kind of a rest for the bottom of the stem with my thumb and then swipe with my index finger up and down and this really helps so I'm not accidentally dislodging it from my ear as I'm trying to find that sweet spot again I'd expect everyone's experience with this is going to be slightly different depending on how they fit in the ear I'm really glad that the stem controls are now present but more often than not over the past few months I've definitely found myself still in the habit of adjusting the volume on my phone or if I'm wearing wearing an Apple Watch with the digital crown and also it's the little things that I really appreciate how these no longer have that kind of high-pitched squeal noise that you might have experienced on The Originals when you have noise canceling on and you accidentally cover the grill with your hand or in some cases it would happen with my longer hair or for those of you who like to sleep with earbuds on I know there are some of you out there it could sometimes happen when you rest your head against the pillow so my eardrums thank you for alleviating that on the newer version Apple thank you no earbud video is complete without talking about the sound and of course this is very subjective but for me the airpods Pro 2 have really filled in the picture compared to the first generation now if you're coming to them for the first time without having dipped into the Apple earbud system before they are definitely the best sounding and the most rounded of all the options that you can choose from right now including for me the airpods of third generation so for my ears the sound profile definitely has more emphasis on the bass than any other Apple earbud that I've tested but it is balanced in such a way so I don't feel like I need to constantly crank the volume to also hear that definition in the mids and The Trebles like I do on some other wireless earbuds still I am craving a user adjustable equalizer from the settings app rather than relying on the Adaptive equalizer all the time as great as it is even when I'm switching between musical genres I just like extra customization the active noise canceling also gets a boost that I wasn't expecting to make as much difference as it actually does my colleague David carnoy's review which is great and I highly recommend you give it a watch right up here goes into detail about how the ANC is improved across the range of frequencies and he does a great job of explaining this even further but to cut a long story short in all the situations that I've used the noise cancellation so even when I'm trying to mute out the sounds of the waves at the beach when I'm on a phone call it's been noticeably improved over the first generation adaptive transparency Mode still continues to surprise me and two months in I still get kind of a bit of a shock when it does kick in sometimes now this helps to lower the volume of external sounds that are above an 85 decibel threshold and for me I found it most helpful on walks that's usually when I rely on transparency mode to keep an ear out for my surroundings but say a loud rumbling truck goes past and then density is muted a lot more than it would be if I didn't have this mode on but I do feel the effect could be a little bit more subtle or gradual sometimes when it does kick in I feel it goes from Full ambient transparency mode and then feeling like somehow I've suddenly turned on active noise cancellation when I wasn't looking and live listen it's still my favorite secret spying tool no just just kidding I would never use my earbuds for nefarious purposes so if you're not familiar with live listen it's basically letting you use your iPhone as a microphone to pick up audio while you're wearing the airpods and echoing them to your ears now this is not new on the airpods Pro 2 but I'm still actually surprised at how many people don't know this exists so definitely try it out and it is great for accessibility now on a more serious note the other accessibility options on the airpods Pro 2 are really thorough whether that's adjusting the click stem speed or adjusting how exactly that transparency mode works to having things like background sounds and I unexpectedly really love background sounds again not new to the airpods Pro 2 but sometimes I do leave these in my ears even when I'm not on a call or listening to music and then through the accessibility menu you can toggle on soothing background sounds like the ocean or something like rain battery life is better than the original airpods Pro in terms of overall listening time I'm generally averaging between five and a half to six hours with moderate volume using transparency mode Now using active noise cancellation does drop that a little bit further but I do find actually anecdotally I feel like I am charging the case itself a little bit more than I did with the originals so what's next well I really hope that there's going to be some sort of high resolution audio playback support in the future yes obviously Bluetooth does have its limitations but maybe there's something extra that can be unlocked in a future update especially given that Apple music now supports lossless audio Apple's done something similar before with the first generation airpods Pro if you do remember back in 2020 they suddenly got this spatial audio feature when the software support unlocked the capabilities of the built-in gyroscope and accelerometer a year after they were originally launched so I'm still holding out hope true multi-point connectivity is still one of those features that I do miss the most when I come from some other wireless earbuds and while Apple's quick switching between devices signed into the same Apple ID does offer some relief and it does work really well it doesn't quite go all the way for me in my particular use case if I'm switching say between my work MacBook and an iPhone well obviously like I'm not going to sign into my personal Apple ID on my work computer because you know like maybe that's a niche really Niche example but I'm sure you could also be in the same situation as me now having true multi-point here would be a really nice option to be able to connect two devices at the same time without manually needing to toggle on or just rely that it's going to pick up when I'm switching between them now the other part of the equation that's left out is how these actually fare with an Android phone now I haven't spent enough time with them on Android as I usually tend to gravitate to another set of earbuds like the Sony xm4s when I am using an Android phone but I'm always interested to hear of your experience and if you are interested in a breakout video about airpods and Android let me know I will get testing So In Sum the airpods Pro 2 not perfect but they have almost everything I wanted in the original airpods Pro and I really enjoy using these earbuds but what have they been like for you I'm curious to know how they're holding up and what your experience has been like as always the comments are open and you can find me on your favorite social media platform like subscribe and all that jazz I'll see you later [Music]
AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds, the new Apple airpods Pro Gen 2 of arguably the most popular wireless earbuds available Apple claims they're even better than before but how are they better what's new what's been improved and by how much most importantly should you buy them you've got questions I've got answers [Music] welcome back everyone I'm Caleb Dennison and this is my review of the second generation Apple airpods Pro I've been looking forward to these coming out for well over a year now why because for all of the excellent wireless earbuds and headphones I get to test all of which spend at least some time in my backpack the Apple airpods Pro have assumed permanent residency in my bag they go everywhere with me so a new and improved version of my go-to buds yes please so whether you already own airpods Pro and an upgrade is a foregone conclusion or you never jumped on the airpods pro bandwagon and you're wondering if the hype is real and if they're worth the premium price or you just want to see if the airpods pro really are all that I think you're gonna love this video and if you do let me know by slapping it with a like subscribe if you want to see more okay let's dive in so when I started in on this review I told myself I was not going to constantly compare the New Gen 2 airpods Pro to the Gen 1 version then as I started testing them I realized that was not only unavoidable but but probably the best way to talk about the New Gen 2 version so let's start with the case it is indistinguishable in size and shape from the OG and although the scale says it's got a few more grams on it I can't tell what is meaningfully different is that you can now charge the airpods pro using an Apple Watch charger and that's in addition to the Qi wireless charging and of course the lightning cable option there's also a hole for a lanyard here and apple will gladly sell you one for 13 bucks sorry you don't get one in the box but my favorite part is the built-in speaker not only does it chime when you start charging the case or the buds but it will help you find the case if you misplace it which honestly I've done more often than I'd like to admit the case holds about the same amount of charge as before but the second gen airpods Pro buds themselves I'm happy to report do indeed last a little bit longer with ANC turned on I got them to last for about 6 hours and 12 minutes before they died on me the case will recharge them four more times so you're looking at a little over 30 hours of use before you will have to charge the case now that's not industry leading battery life but I think it's plenty practical and besides I'm less fixated on that battery number than I am on the overall performance of the earbuds which I'm about to dig into oh one more thing about the case it is now ipx4 rated just like the airpods themselves in the box you'll get one more size of ear tips for a total of four options including the tips that come pre-installed it's those extra small tips that personally I think matter most but that's because I know someone who has a hard time finding in-ear buds that will work with their tiny ears and the airpods pro are now perfect for them to make sure you get the best seal which I cannot stress enough is absolutely essential toward getting the best sound quality the best passive noise isolation and the best active noise canceling Apple has built this trick little test into the airpods pro Settings app I tested it and it actually works the default ear tips have always worked best for me but I tried them all and the test let me know when I had a size too large or small for my ears guiding me right back to the Goldilocks tips that were on the earbuds in the first place now taking a closer look at the earbuds themselves Apple has improved its in-use detector with skin detection which is great because now they won't activate and waste battery if you stuff them in your pocket or handbag or whatever it knows the difference between your jeans and your skin now part of the redesign that Apple didn't mention during their announcement is that they work to improve wind noise abatement there have been subtle changes in the stem here so that the microphones are less susceptible to wind interference in the first place then of course you have apple wind noise reduction built into the H2 chip as well which I'll get into momentarily so with a quick Refresh on some of the new stuff you can see let's get to the stuff that really matters right that's call Quality ANC and transparency mode quality and of course sound quality let's start with call Quality and for that I'm going to step outside welcome to a bustling thoroughfare in downtown Portland Oregon this is a place where you might have buses going by a light rail train honking its horn Fatboy motorcycles and super impressive with Mufflers that aren't designed to muffle Jack Squat and of course you've got emergency vehicles and their sirens sounds that on their own are already kind of noisy but when they all happen together can really cause some troubles in fact they're the source of many frustrated lost takes in our studio at times now on their own these sounds are already kind of annoying but you don't want them bleeding through on a business call if you're walking around taking a business call you don't want people necessarily aware that you're out and about on a busy City street and the airpods pro do an exemplary job of just knocking that noise out now the voice Clarity itself isn't perfect even in a completely silent environment like our studio here you can tell I'm on wireless headphones as opposed to speaking on my actual phone but when it comes to call Quality short of using a wired microphone and a silent office it just doesn't get much better than the airpods pro and that was already true now with the second gen it's just a little bit better background noises are squashed from a hush to a whisper okay now to talk about noise canceling and transparency mode so first off it's called adaptive transparency mode now and that adaptive part I love it so if you've seen my reviews of the original airpods Pro or the airpods max then you know I consider Apple's transparency mode to be the best in the business I've described it as the next best thing to not having headphones on at all because it's pretty realistic well now I actually feel like in some cases adaptive transparency mode can sound better than real life the Adaptive part basically means that if a ridiculously loud noise happens while you're in transparency mode then the airpods pro are going to stomp down on that a little bit they won't cancel it out or anything I mean if someone honks their car horn at you because they're about to cream you as you cut them off on your bike then you need to hear that horn what you don't need is for the sudden insanely loud car or truck horn to be Amplified by your headphones all but guaranteeing a heart attack from the scare Apple's example of a jackhammer is probably better but you get it right you can enjoy transparency mode without having Extremely Loud Noises piped in and harshing your Chill Vibes on the other end of the spectrum is noise canceling which Apple's somewhat dubiously claims is twice as effective as the original airpods Pro does that mean that everything is twice as quiet are we talking about half the decibels of noise making it through or that they can handle noises that are twice as loud no none of those things are true look I'm no math wizard but I know that Apple has many math Wizards on staff and I'm sure that it's on solid legal footing when it makes that claim as much as I'd like to go on a rant here let's not get hung up on that statistic though the bottom line is that the new airpods Pro have more effective noise canceling but really in what way is it more effective well to be sure Apple's claim that it more effectively cancels high frequency noise is absolutely true I went to the coffee shop in my building where I can always count on boisterous Baristas to make plenty of conversational noise even if there's nobody else in the space and sure enough the second gen airpods Pro quieted down people's voices more effectively and this is without any music or podcast audio going just a and C on its own I also tested them with a white noise pattern playing on some speakers and it was clear that more high frequencies were cut there as well and for the ultimate test I compared the airpods pro to the Sony wh-1000xm5 over ear headphones and while I feel like the xm5 cut noise out slightly more than the airpods pro I was really surprised at how close it was I can't wait to take the airpods pro on a flight next week for the ultimate test so I'll say this the second gen airpods Pro so have better ANC and I'd argue some of the best ANC out there period if you want to use them just to quiet the world down they'll do that without the aid of music or any other audio but once you start playing music movies or podcasts that's it the world around you is gone in the world of earbuds I think only the Bose qc2 can hold a candle to the airpods pro now let's talk about sound quality and in order to make this meaningful for you I need to take you through the experience I had testing and comparing so I started out like I always do listening to certain tracks I always use when testing audio gear at first just listening to the new airpods Pro then later going back and forth between the new 2nd gen and the first gen and I was having a tough time hearing the differences but not because they weren't there to hear I was getting distracted by how the differences in sound quality varied as I tried to get the volume or technically the loudness equalized between the two see it seemed like I needed to turn turn the Gen 1 up to match the volume of the Gen 2 but then I realized the Gen 1 were actually too loud when I did that but when I was sure I had the overall volume as balanced as I could get it I noticed that the Gen 2 seemed like they had a fuller more even tempered sound and that's when I realized that it was actually Apple's adaptive EQ that was coming into play and then it was working way better on the second gen airpods Pro when you're listening at lower volumes the Gen 2 airpods Pro Sound full and well balanced they almost don't seem as quiet even at those lower levels though the average decibel level was clearly brought down and at higher volumes the second gen hold together better there's less Distortion and better overall balance now I don't know how much of the difference I'm hearing is due to the new driver how much is due to the new amplification and how much is the new H2 chip processing and honestly I don't care the second gen airpods PRO Sound sound better the overall bass response seems similar it's got a little punch a reasonable amount of depth it's never bloated or flabby the mid-range is open and uncolored but it's the high frequencies especially that enjoy the most audible Improvement the transit response of symbols and guitar strings the overtones of brass instruments and acoustic piano the organic sound of acoustic drums and percussion all of it just sounds great like with the original airpods Pro I said they sounded more than good enough for most folks but with the second gen airpods Pro I think they're worth taking a really close listen to they definitely have their own sound signature and I think it's one that most folks will love not just like but actually love people are gonna eat these up no doubt the airpods pro will be going where I go they're staying in the bag I mean I use an iPhone an Apple Watch and iPad and lately I've been using an Apple TV more often still haven't switched to Mac don't know if that will ever happen but the airpods pro make a lot of sense anyway since I use a fair number of Apple products thing is the new airpods Pro are more than just practical they're a treat to use the ANC is Top Notch the transparency mode can't be beat the case is easy to find they fit well and they sound really good even if you aren't an Apple user I think you have to admit these are just a remarkably solid set of earbuds and if you are an Apple user well I say run don't walk and get yourself a set you'll be thrilled you did thanks as always for watching everyone as earbuds go what's your all-time favorite set let me know down in the comments don't forget to like And subscribe and here's two other videos I think you might like
AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds,
Sony Linkbuds S," - I'm a little confused. (box thumping) We just did a video on Sony's LinkBuds, whose claim to fame is that they've got this donut shaped hole in the middle, allowing ambient sound to pass through, giving them effectively
an open-backed sound. Sony, then followed up on
these with the LinkBuds S, the opposite of that. The LinkBuds S are an active
noise-canceling product that do not have any kind of open-backed, sound pass through design. They just use software to allow you to hear the sound around you, just like, well, any other
ANC earphones. (laughs) My questions are two then. A, Sony, why did you use the LinkBuds name to describe something
so totally different. And B why should I care about... Wow. Okay. They're really light. Sony says these are the
smallest and the lightest true wireless, active
noise-canceling earphones. And they are astonishingly light. Here's one of our ANC mics. You can see that right there. Here's our charging contacts. Here's the proximity sensor, so it can tell if it's in your ear. They've got this cool new software feature that's kind of like a
soundtrack to your life, they're supposed to know where you are and what you're doing. So, right after you get off of a call they might behave it a certain way. Or if you put them in your ears maybe they just start
auto-playing music for you. Right here, that looks like our, either microphone or microphone
array for voice pickup. These might actually
be around the same size as the AirPods Pros. I still haven't found something
to replace them day-to-day. The FP8s from LG are so close but the shape of the carrying
case is just not as ideal. I mean, the LinkBuds are super cool but I do need ANC, that's a
feature I care about a lot. There's just nothing that beats the pocketability of this for me. And you can see even
now on the LinkBuds S, Sony's carrying case is markedly thicker, but in terms of its X and Y, it's actually about darn near the same. The thing is if the
not-Apples of the world were offering substantially
more battery life or features out of this extra bulk it would
be a lot easier to forgive, but in general, they're not. This one is rated at 20 hours
of battery life in the case, plus six from the earphones themselves, for a total of about 26, which is solid, but not groundbreaking. One thing that's really cool
that I'm noticing though is they've got this kind of ribbed texture on the silicone eartips
that I would think, I mean this is just intuitively speaking I don't have any
empirical evidence for it, but I would think would help them stay in your ears more easily. Wow, those are... Man, like I can tell in
my hand that they're small but these are really compact. I do not anticipate that there would be any
challenges whatsoever, even sleeping with these in, and I could not imagine a scenario where I could get them out of my ears. They haven't budged at
all, not even a little. Touch-sensitive controls on the side. So let's just figure out
what all the buttons do. I'm assuming a long press is... Hey, there we go, I'm in... Oh, oh, that's the temporary feature that I screwed up on the XM5 unboxing. So that's working perfectly fine. I will say that with an in
ear it's not as comfortable because you're kind of
pushing it into your ear. I mean, I guess... Okay, it works a little
better if you just have your whole hand against
the side of your head, it's still, I'd say not as comfortable as if you had an over the ear, and I'd like to see a bit
of a shorter delay on it, personally, but then I could
see running into trouble where if you are just adjusting your hair or something like that, you could... What just happened? I went like this and it's like, da da da. Did I just change the mode? Now it's in transparency
mode all the time? Credit to Sony, they've
done an excellent job of the transparency mode on this at least as far as my
own voice is concerned, I haven't really heard you
guys talk much yet but... - [Jono] You look pretty good. - [Andy] Hello. - Yeah. That's extremely natural sounding. It's hard to get both right. It's hard to get the
sound of the speaker right and the sound of the surroundings right. But Sony has done, to my quick ears, an excellent job of that. I never really talked about charging, the case supports wireless charging and there's also a USB-C input here. I like this. Maybe it's old fashioned but just gimme a fricking pairing button. I don't want to have to
remember a special dance for every stupid device in my life. Just put a pairing button on things, you hold the button, they go in a pairing mode, there. I'm over it. I do like the whole magical
pairing experience thing but as a backup, I just
want that hardware button. See? Even Apple still does it. This video is brought to you by iFixit. iFixit wants you to join

the audio's coming from here and you're in this space where it's reflecting off
all the walls and everything. But if you pre-record it getting that kind of
imaging into a stereo source is kind of trivial. So I don't know if they've
actually processed this from that same original file or if they're just kind of cheating. Wow. I normally try to evaluate this
much earlier in the process for an active noise-canceling headphone, but never mind the just
general hums of the studio which are completely gone, I could barely hear you guys talking from like, I don't know,
six, seven feet away? - [Andy] Hi, Linus. How
are you doing today? - That's really good and I
didn't even stop to think that the active noise-canceling was on because it doesn't have any
kind of pressure feeling, there's nothing unpleasant
about having it activated. Available operations on the left unit. Okay. Noise-canceling, ambient sound. Hello. Wow, you've kind of really
got a mash on it though, which to be clear is probably a good thing 'cause you don't wanna
be laying on a pillow or just brushing against
it and having it activate. So I get it. I will say that compared to
a more rounded shape here, this flatter shape, right
along the back here, is not as comfortable for me. So when I press, if I were
to press on this in my ear it has more to brace on in
the outer part of my ear. Whereas with this one, when I press on it to activate something, I am jamming that thing
further into my ear. - [Andy] Linus? Could
you lean back a tiny bit? - Sorry? - [Andy] Could you lean back a tiny bit? - Oh yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Just...
(crew laughing) - [Andy] The noise-canceling works. - By default, the right side
has functions already bound, tap, double tap, triple tap. I wish the double and triple
tap registered a little faster. It's amazing what a difference good active noise-canceling makes to how loud you feel like you
have to turn up your music. There's a strong argument to be made for just springing for ANC just to make sure you're
not turning up your music so loud that you're
gonna damage your ears. Different EQ presets are here. (upbeat music) Honestly, these have a more balanced sound right outta the box than the XM5s did. Hmm, that's annoying. That's the thing about
touch controls, man. I do like the stem squeeze
on the AirPods Pros. Touch, anytime you go to adjust them you're liable to
(train horn blaring) control something. - [Andy] Did you hear the train? - Oh. I don't even have an active
noise-canceling on right now. I'm just in passive mode. - [Jono] Oh, what? - Yeah, no, it's just off right now, 'cause they isolate noise well. That's why I thought the
branding was so confusing, 'cause the regular LinkBuds are all about letting
ambient noise through. Well, let's turn on the noise-canceling. Like is it doing things? Yeah, I have no awareness
of that whatsoever. - [Jono] Ooh, that's dangerous. - We are going to be
finalizing which head and torso we're gonna be using for audio reviews on LTT moving forward, probably today, I think we're actually sending
back the other one tomorrow. So we can get you guys real numbers, but I would bet at least
lunch with our new audio guy that these have extremely strong ANC. To my ear they also sound excellent right outta the box as well. I'm liking them. At $199, yeah, you got my attention Sony. Killer. Subscribe. (case clicking)"
Sony Linkbuds S,
Sony Linkbuds S," The Sony Linkbuds S are a set of earbuds 
that initially I wasn’t very impressed with,   but the more I used them over the past 6 
months, the more I came to really like them,   and I think they’re actually a bit better than 
the Sony WF-1000XM4s, which have been my earbuds   of choice over the past year. The Linkbuds S 
really hit a sweet spot in terms of features,   quality, and of course, price, making 
them a pretty easy pair of earbuds to   recommend. And the first thing I like 
about them is their noise cancellation. Now while it's not as good as the more 
expensive WF-1000XM4s that we've reviewed,   the Linkbuds S noise cancellation 
is still one of the best noise   cancelation experiences I've had on 
a set of earbuds in this price range. I recently took them with me on a plane and when 
I had these in, I couldn't tell the difference   with their noise cancellation between the higher 
price Sony XM4s. Now in other situations, yeah,   I can tell a difference between the two earbuds 
like if music is playing in my room, then i do   think the XM4s noise cancellation is still a bit 
better than the LinkBuds S. The LinkBuds S come   with multiple silicon tips that are very 
similar to the ones found on other earbuds   like the Pixel Buds Pro and Bose Quiet Comfort 
IIs, compared to the foam tips with the XM4s,   which may be part of why the XM4s perform a bit 
better with noise cancellation. The rubber tips   help the LinkBuds S stay in your ear and they 
also help the noise cancellation work better. The Sony Linkbuds S also seem to 
have a spatial vent or some other   design feature that eliminates the 
plugged ear feeling you’d get with   a lot of the early in-ear wireless earbuds 
a few years ago like the Sony WF-1000XM3s. Another thing I've come to love about 
the Linkbuds S is their comfort. They   are extremely comfortable, which is a phrase I'm 
not exactly used to saying about a pair of in-ear   earbuds. It may just be their best feature. 
Their design is much smaller than the XM4s,   40% smaller to be precise, and I’ve found 
I can wear them for hours with their 4.8g   of weight. I’ve tried other earbuds 
like the AirPods Pro or Beats Fit   Pro and they hurt my ears just after 20 
min of wearing them, and even the XM4s,   after wearing them for about an hour and a 
half or so, my ears will start to feel sore. With the LinkBuds S I have no ear soreness, 
they don't fall out of my ears, and overall,   they're the most comfortable set 
of in-ear earbuds I've ever worn. Another thing that's great about the 
Linkbuds S is their connection. It’s   been consistently stable for me when 
listening on my Mac, Pixel, iPhone   etc. And via an over-the-air software update, they 
support multi-point audio, which allows you to   play audio and sounds from more than one connected 
device at a time, and best of all, on Android,   you can enable multi-point audio while still 
keeping LDAC enabled, which is a higher quality   codec the Linkbuds S support for listening 
to higher quality music, which is awesome. Another thing I've enjoyed with the LinkBuds 
S is their mic quality and transparency mode.   Here's how their mics sound. And these 
are how the Sony LinkBuds S mics sound,   let me know in the comments…how do you think 
they sound? For their transparency mode,   while nothing compares to the 
transparency mode on my AirPods Max,   Overall I think the LinkBuds S has one of the 
best transparency modes i've experienced on a   set of earbuds and compared to the 
WF-1000XM4s, i think the LinkBuds S   transparency mode is actually a little bit 
better, thanks to their better onboard mics. And their battery life is pretty 
decent for their size and weight,   6 hours battery life and 14 hours remaining in 
the case and you’ll get a notification from the   Sony headphones app when the headphones 
case battery level dips below 30%. To charge the Linkbuds S case, you’ll 
need a USB-C chord as they don’t come   with wireless charging and speaking of the 
case, when I first bought the Linkbuds S,   their case felt very rough, almost rugged 
and not very smooth, which felt a bit weird,   but over the past 6 months, the case material 
has smoothed out a bit and feels a lot better. Also, kudos to Sony for being one of 
those companies embracing plastic-free   packaging. I wish more companies 
would get on board and do this. The last thing I like about these buds is 
actually the Sony Headphones app. This app,   while it has some odd quirks and features, is 
overall a highlight to these buds and Sony has   made some welcome improvements to it. It has 
useful features like being able to set the   ambient sound allowed in for transparency mode. If 
you want to tweak the sound profile of your buds,   Sony included an EQ feature, though for 
these buds, I actually think they sound   pretty good out of the box, so I haven’t 
toyed with the EQ feature all that much,   and if you want to improve sound quality, the 
app is of course where you can prioritize sound   quality for their bluetooth connection and 
turn on DSEE, which is Sony’s proprietary   technology for upscaling low-quality music 
so you’ll hear more clarity and detail,   though if you’re already listening to most 
modern music through an iPhone or Android   and a music-streaming app, I haven’t noticed 
a huge difference with this feature turned on. The other thing Sony added in the app I really 
like is on the status page you can monitor the   decibel level you’re listening at with your 
headphones, which is really useful if you   don’t want to listen to your music at unsafe 
levels that can permanently damage your hearing. The app also includes some features that 
work well. I've just preferred to leave   off while testing these buds like adaptive 
sound control, where the app will detect   your actions like walking or sitting and 
adjust the noise cancellation automatically,   I found this feature with this product and past 
Sony products to be just more annoying than   helpful. the same thing with speak to chat, which 
is my limited testing, works well by pausing your   music and turning on transparency mode when 
the earbuds detect your talking to someone,   but I prefer just to have manual control 
over when music stops and then resumes again. The app does have some odd quirks though like a 
badge system to reward you for using the product,   which is just dumb, and an entire services tab 
for extra stuff you can do with the LinkBuds   S and apps they’ll work with, but other than 
Spotify, I’m not sure how useful the rest are. The last thing I like about the LinkBuds S is 
their sound quality. For a pair of your buds   in this price range, their sound quality is 
pretty good. Now, if you're buying these,   expecting them to sound just as good as the 
WF-1000XM4s, unfortunately, you're going to be   a bit disappointed. Sony used different drivers 
for these buds than the XM4s, and as a result,   I’ve found the Linkbuds S sound doesn’t quite 
match the XM4s. The XM4s sound a bit more full,   where the LinkBuds S, they still sound very 
clean, but you'll notice less separation in   certain tracks. So that's everything I've liked 
about the LinkBuds S for the past six months of   using them. Now, let's talk downsides and some 
things I think Sony could improve with these buds. The first thing I think Sony could 
improve with these buds is wireless   charging support. They'd be almost perfect 
if their case included wireless charging.   Another downside is unlike some competing 
buds, the Sony Linkbuds S don’t give you   any way to control the volume of the 
earbuds with tap or swipe controls,   though this won’t be as bothersome to those who 
use a smartwatch with media controls like on my   Apple Watch Series 8 or Pixel Watch, Both of 
which will have reviews out on soon. So make   sure you subscribe to the channel in order to 
see our long-term reviews of these two watches. Sony could use their Triple and Double tap 
functions on the left earbud for volume   control. Right now these actions are reserved for 
a Quick Access feature that only works right now,   with Spotify Tap and Endel. Why Sony doesn't like 
you customize these actions more is beyond me. Another downside I’ve encountered with the 
earbuds is actually with their multipoint   connectivity. Let's say I have the LinkBuds S 
connected to both my iPad and my Android phone.   I just simply hold down the right earbud 
here thinking that I'm going to trigger   the Google Assistant on my phone when in 
fact I just triggered Siri on the iPad. Unlike features like Apple’s iCloud switching 
feature for AirPods where Apple most of the time   knows which product you’re currently using and 
switches audio from that device to your AirPods,   Sony doesn't know which product you're 
actively using at the current moment.   So it's very easy to trigger the 
wrong assistant on the wrong device. Also it takes just a second 
or two longer than I’d like to   actually trigger the Assistant 
on the devices from the buds. You can also load the Google Assistant and Amazon 
Assistant onto the earbuds as well, though I   typically just stick with whatever assistant 
is on the device I want to play music from. The last downside I've encountered 
with these buds is with phone   calls. When calls start on the Link Buds, 
transparency/ambient sound mode will turn on,   which is okay. But let's say there's a lot 
of background noise and I want to be able   to block that out and concentrate on the call 
that I've picked up on my phone. On my XM4s,   I can tap the left bud to trigger more noise 
cancellation to kick in but on the LinkBuds S,   I can’t seem to do this and still can hear 
background noise which is slightly annoying. So that's everything I've liked and 
disliked about these Sony LinkBuds S,   and overall, I think these are actually 
a pretty fantastic set of earbuds. The more I’ve used them, the more I’ve liked 
them, especially their fantastic comfort,   water resistance, mic quality, and sound, at 
a retail price of $199 US dollars but you can   often find them on sale for between $120 and $150 
dollars. I think these are a great set of in-ear   buds for both iPhone and Android users and they'll 
easily pair to devices like Windows PCs and Macs. I've left purchase links in the video and

Sony Linkbuds S, hey folks so not too long ago sony released its donut-shaped link buds with an open design that's certainly unique looking now it's back with these guys the link butts s a more traditional set of noise isolating and yes noise canceling earbuds that have a pretty premium 200 price tag but sit below sony's flagship wf-1000x mark 4 buds they're really appealing a lot of ways but are they the best for the money let's talk about that [Music] now some of you are probably wondering what the s in link buzz s stands for i don't think it exactly stands for one thing or at least that's what sony rep told me it seems to stand for a bunch of s words like smartness and sound quality and silence and a seamless connection to your online and offline worlds which in sony speak means they're designed to be worn all the time they're basically the sony equivalent of the airpods pro and the first thing you notice about them is that they're really lightweight and smaller than the wf-1000x mark 4 bus in fact sony's calling them the smallest and lightest noise-cancelling high-res true wireless earbuds because they do support sony's so-called near-lossless lvdeck audio codec for bluetooth streaming but more on that in a minute let me go through some of the other key design highlights first [Music] like the standard length buds these are made out of recycled plastic or at least partially so and come in two color options of black and white it's interesting to note that the black version has more of a textured finish while the white one has a completely smooth finish i don't know if that means that the black version has more recycled plastic in it but the two cases are exactly the same size and they're nice and compact just slightly bigger than the airpods pro's case but unlike the wf-1000x mark force case it doesn't have wireless charging just usbc charging a lot of the buzz in this price range do have wireless charging the earbuds fit my ears really well and they are quite comfortable they also don't stick out of your ears too far they sit fairly flush and should fit a variety of ear types even small ears and on another positive note i was able to get a tight seal with the included ear tips which wasn't exactly the case for me with the wf 1000 x mark 4 buds as i've said many times that tight seal is crucial for both optimal sound quality and optimal noise cancelling these use sony's v1 chip not its qn1 chip and they just don't have the same components not the same drivers on the same microphone so you're not going to get quite the same sound quality noise cancellation as you get with the wf-1000x mark iv but both the sound and noise cancelling are really solid overall and while the noise canceling is a slight step behind the wf-1000x4s it's not a big step there's also an ambient mode with adjustable levels that allow you to tweak how much sound you want to let in from the outside world it may not be quite as good as what apple offers with its transparency mode in terms of how natural things sound but it does sound pretty natural so long as you don't crank it up to the highest level these have sony's quick attention mode that allows you to tap and hold the left button to muffle the music you're listening to and enter ambient mode so you can hear what's going on around you and have a conversation there's also the speak to chat feature that's essentially hands-free quick attention if someone comes up to you and wants to chat you can simply start talking hey how you doing and your audio pauses and the earbuds go into ambient mode the audio then resumes after a short period of time anywhere from 5 seconds to 30 seconds depending on your preference or you can manually resume it by tapping on either bud i thought the touch controls worked well so no problems there and i didn't have any issues with dropouts the bluetooth 5.2 connection with my iphone 13 pro and a couple of android phones was rock solid they have an ipx4 splash proof rating so you can use them for sporting activities and they stayed in my ears securely even though they don't have any sport fins i had no trouble running with them and use them for a few days at the gym battery life is rated at six hours with an extra 14 hours in the charging case that may not be great but it's not bad considering the compact size of the buds and by comparison the standard link buds offer 5.5 hours of battery life and those don't have active noise cancelling sony throws in several extra features including an adaptive sound control mode that'll adjust the sound and noise cancelling on the fly based on your environment plenty of eq settings in the app to tweak the sound of it if you want naturally these have support for sony's 360 audio virtual surround music format select few music services that offer 360 audio tracks and sony's also introducing some new features like autoplay that automatically launches a custom spotify playlist based on your activity and finally there are new partnerships with endl and microsoft soundscape in the services section of the app i find all that stuff a little gimmicky but you can have fun checking it all out as i said the link buds s sound quite good with nicely detailed sound the trouble's got some sparkle to it and the bass is well defined it has plenty of punch they have a relatively open exciting sound and are slightly more forward sounding than the wf-1000x mark iv which offer a bit more depth and slightly richer sound quality overall however for their size and weight you'll be hard-pressed to find a better sounding set of buds and if you have an android device or dedicated music player that supports ldac bluetooth streaming you can get a touch better sound when streaming with a music service like full buzz or title that offers high resolution tracks okay before i get into some final comparisons let's talk about voice quality for calls because that's become an important feature for a lot of people sony says these have special mesh covered microphones that are supposed to help with reducing wind noise and you've got some new ai some software algorithms to help reduce background noise in general all right so now i got a lot of traffic in the background dog barking back there so i'm talking again just some people get a sense of how my voice sounds as there's a lot of background noise again any extra thoughts mostly the same problem uh i i really don't hear too much background noise at all but uh the problem is maybe it's overcompensating because of that background noise but your actual voice quality just is not great okay so for narcase it looks like the regular link buzz are better for calls and the sony wh 1000 x mark 5 are definitely a step up for a call so there you have it that's our test call for the link buds s thanks for listening john so i had high expectations for voice calling and while i think the link buttons felt a little short in terms of how clearly you could hear my voice with a lot of background noise they do a really good job reducing that background noise by contrast the standard link buds didn't do quite as good a job reducing background noise but people said they could hear my voice more clearly so it'll be interesting to see whether we get a firmware upgrade that tweaks the voice calling ai sony typically does deliver firmware upgrades every few months like i said at the beginning the link bus s are really appealing a lot of ways they're lightweight and compacted don't skimp on the features and performance they're kind of a cross between sony's 100 c 500 buds and the wf 1000 x mark 4 buds i think they sound fuller and better than jobbers elite 7 pro which costs around the same price they're also pretty lightweight and compact it's a tougher call when you compare them to the 200 beats fit pro the beats sound really good and for apple users anyway they have some extra features like spatial audio and always on siri and automatic pairing with all the apple devices in your icloud account alas like the standard link buds these link bus s do not have multi-point bluetooth pairing that would allow you to pair them to two devices simultaneously like a computer and a smartphone these fit pro aren't as discreet looking as these sonys but they do have integrated sport fins that really lock the buzz in your ears some people like that some people don't i do think that if especially you're an android user who can take advantage of the ldac support the link butts as have enough appealing trades to make you consider dropping 200 on them they are the sony buds for people who don't want larger buds like the wf1000x4 but want 80 to 85 percent of their features and performance for 80 less that said i do think there'll be an easier sell once they get discounted a bit because to me anyway they feel more like 150 earbuds than 200 earbuds yeah you can probably say the same thing about the beats fit pro but that's what my gut says so i gotta say it but let me what you guys think what do you think of the design and are these the sony buds you've been waiting for sound off in the comments section if you're interested in any of the products mentioned check out the description below for links on where to find them and you can get even more details in my text review on cnet lastly if you

Sony Linkbuds S, here's why I should get the Sony link buds s over the WF xm4s the link buds are a lot more compact providing Superior comfort and a more secure fit they also allow you to have two devices connected to them at the same time the xm4s still don't have this for some reason the case is more compact although you do lose a bit of total battery life but the sound quality is easily some of the best at their price balance but enough bass for any kind of genre with Crystal Clear mids if you like nice clear vocals and great instrument separation the xm4s do sound slightly better but the link buds come very close it's about a 10 difference there only real sacrifices with the noise canceling it is noticeably better on the xm4s but the link buds still have really strong noise canceling so if you can get past that
Sony Linkbuds S, so for quite a few years now sony's been making arguably the best premium wireless earbuds the latest being the 1000x mark iv's which are known for great features great sound quality and above all else unbeatable active noise cancellation but they have some drawbacks the first one being the massive size of them the earbuds are absolutely huge and the second one being the price they're 280 dollars which is out of reach for a lot of people but sony just came out with what they believe to be a mid-range pair but in my opinion is going to out-compete the high-end 1000x mark fours for quite a few reasons i'm going to mention throughout this video and these are the brand new sony link buds s now these earbuds are more compact they're a lot more comfortable these earbuds also have incredible active noise cancellation that is competitive with the high-end model the x-mark fours and these cost substantially less but that's not all in this video i'm going to talk a lot about what i liked and what i didn't like about the sony link buds s but before we get any further into the video i just want to point out that link buds s finally sony's coming out with a much better naming scheme than wh-1000x mark iv which honestly nobody ever remembers and so linkbuzz asks much better name for this one now we'll talk about what the link buds s had to compromise to cut the price back from the x mark iv's but one of the things that they really didn't compromise much was the active noise cancellation and this is one of my favorite features about these earbuds being that when you put them in not only are they very very powerful but they're also really clean meaning you don't have any kind of hissing you don't have any white noise and it feels like you don't have earbuds in it just feels like the room got quieter which is really the goal for earbuds and that's a goal that a lot of earbuds really miss even very powerful anc earbuds sometimes they have hissing sometimes your ears feel stuffy these really don't have that and so just for reference i mean i did a test a classic test where i play a white noise on my laptop i don't have these earbuds connected and i want to see how at what volume they're able to block out that white noise so with the sound being a jet noise the link buds s were able to block it out up to volume about 22 or 23 while the sony 1000x mark 4s were about volume 24 or 25. so you can see these were really really close in magnitude and on top of that like i said being that the link buds s are substantially lighter that gives you an advantage of feeling like you don't even have earbuds in your ears and just it blocks sound around you very passively in the background so that's a huge positive there but i mentioned that being lighter is important it has a lot of other advantages so let's talk more about the physical design as a whole now these have two different colors they have white and black and you can see the case itself is very similar to the x mark fours in many regards like it's slightly smaller but otherwise it stands upright it has usb type c on the back we also have a button on the back for pairing and this is made out of recycled plastic so it does feel slightly more like matte and maybe a little bit cheaper gives it a lighter feel to it but i mean the case is definitely going to be durable enough i don't really have any concerns with that and when we open the case up you'll see the earbuds are probably about half the size of the 1000 x mark fours which i think is a massive reduction considering they still have six hours of battery in the earbuds which is really impressive and 20 hours when you include the case now the earbuds themselves on the outside have a touch pad you can customize this sort of and i'll show you the app in a little bit later in the video but these also have a microphone on the bottom covered with a little mesh screen and i'll get into a microphone test and on the inside they have a proximity sensor so you can actually sense when they're in or out of your ears for auto playing and auto pausing and sony added a really cool new feature for the auto play and auto pause which essentially allows you to take these out and just connect to spotify and start playing automatically now we'll talk a lot more about the features and the functions within the app but these sony's really been marketing them as the smallest high-res anc earbuds which i know is really pinpointing one specific thing but i would say that's a specific thing that everybody's trying to be like you want to be the smallest because one is going to be more comfortable if they're lighter in your ears two it's going to be smaller in your pocket then and three they're going to be more secure if they weigh less they're less likely to fall out of your ears if you're working out or running or something like that which by the way these are ipx4 water resistant so working out shouldn't be a problem but the second thing there being high res of course is audio quality and you want these to sound as good as possible now resolution isn't everything and we'll dive into what these are good and what they're not good at but of course the third thing being anc earbuds really it's a really solid package for a pair of earbuds all right so this is the onboard microphone on my pixel 6 pro just to show you the ambient sound around me now let's check out the link buttons all right so this is my protest with the link buds s obviously a lot of wind going on right now a lot of traffic behind me and what i was saying before about not liking the transparency mode like i said a little bit tunnelly but i kind of realized right now one of the big issues is the wind i definitely hear that a little bit but let's see how the microphones sound if i was in a video or on a phone call like this leave a comment and let me know if you can hear what i'm saying and now for reference these are the sony wf-1000x mark fours again let me know what you think of this microphone in comparison with the link button's s uh to see which one actually sounds better and how close they really are so as you heard right there the microphone on the link buds s is honestly even better than the flagship x mark fours let's actually dive a bit deeper into that auto play feature i was talking about earlier so if we open the sony app you'll see we have four tabs status sound system and services over in services this is what i was talking about so they have spotify quick tap which is similar to what we saw in the galaxy buds and it essentially allows you to start or resume playing on spotify without ever having to take your phone out of your pocket so if you just put these in your ear and you double tap it'll start playing spotify you also have endel quick access which i've never used that service but i believe it's like soundscapes or white noise and we do also have autoplay as well which essentially is going to allow you to automatically play either music or relaxing sounds or whatever when you put the earbuds in your ear so really a cool service there and something i'm excited to see and really start using more currently it's in beta but by the time you guys actually get the earbuds hopefully they are out of beta now going through some of the other features this is where we start to get into really one of the caveats one of the things that i thought was a setback on these earbuds going back to status we have adaptive sound control which some people might really like this and this is going to allow you to change between essentially active noise cancellation or transparency like a hear through mode which the hear through mode on these is is good but it's not the best like there's many of the earbuds out there that sound a lot better and you hear their surroundings better these sound a little bit tunnelly like a little bit more synthetic and digital but regardless they're still they work and you can hear the things around you and it's a decent enough experience but not the best and that's not really the reason that i don't necessarily like this feature the main reason is because if you're wearing them and like say for example this morning i i got out of bed i put them in my ears and i was just listening to music walking around doing stuff and then you like go up to the sink and you want to brush your teeth because you're standing there they're going to all of a sudden give like a beeping sound and then switch over to like a different a different mode whether that's active noise cancellation or something like that but that i thought was a little bit annoying that it makes that beeping sound whenever you start walking or whenever you stop walking so i turned adaptive sound control off that's a feature that sounds really cool but at least for me that's it's not something that i really plan on using if we go over to sound you have some really cool things here however you have speak to chat which allows you to just start talking and it'll automatically turn your music down and kind of pause it a little bit and you can hear your surroundings so you turn a hear through mode on so if you're somebody comes over to your desk and it detects that you start speaking to them you don't have to take the earbuds out it'll just reduce your volume you can talk to somebody and then when you're done talking it'll give you maybe 15 or 30 seconds and then it'll start playing your music again we have an equalizer down here of course and the sound quality on these uh honestly they sound really good these have ldac which is going to be one of the best codecs you can get for for listening to music when you're listening to music you'll notice these are pretty warm almost to the point of being a bit dark and they lack a little bit of brilliance and sparkle but definitely there is a very strong sub bass great resolution and a little bit less spatial replication and instrument separation than the xmark force they're not quite at the level of those with the overall capacity of the earbuds but the overall sound profile of these i think they sounded really good especially if you're listening to tidal or something you can really make good use of that high resolution these are really a fun pair of earbuds that most listeners especially in untrained ear are going to really enjoy a pretty surprising amount of bass for a small pair of earbuds like this as well now of course if you're more of an audiophile you're going to notice that like i said it's a little bit on the dark end i wish we could boost up the treble a little bit more the eq didn't quite do it for me but regardless still a pretty solid sounding pair of earbuds now of course any kind of adjustments you want to make you can do that in the equalizer right here and of course scrolling down we also have sony's 360 reality audio i didn't turn that on because i don't ever really like the spatial audio from apple or 360 audio on here but some people really do like that and that's a cool feature that again does work with something like tidal for example and we have dse extreme as well if you want to turn that on so otherwise if you go over to system this is where i said you can kind of customize the touch controls but not really like you can only customize left or right so if we tap on the little settings icon there we can choose the left earbud or the right earbud and for each one you get a choice of one of three different preset functions for them so you can either have playback control which gives you this array of settings or you can go to volume control which only gives you two things and so you can't really choose like you can't say single tap do this double tap do that you have to choose a package for each earbud and so that's something that i wasn't really fond of i don't know why they didn't let us customize each individual function like sennheiser does for example hey so i'm editing the video right now and i realized i didn't mention that these do not have wireless charging which for 200 i thought was really surprising i don't really know of many other earbuds that cost nearly this much and don't have wireless charging in 2022 but leave a comment and let me know if that's something you're willing to live without or if you think that that is a deal breaker a big positive is that the link buds s are using bluetooth 5.2 which is the latest version of bluetooth which is great because it allows you to listen to just one earbud at a time while the other one is in the case you're also getting pretty low latency but one thing that i was not seeing with these that i was really hoping to see was a multi-point connection i was really hoping i'd be able to connect the two phones at once now maybe that's something that's going to be updated in a firmware update but at least right now it's not something i'm seeing so the link puts s like i said sony thinks that these are going to be a mid-range pair so they're going to go between the 1000 x mark 4s which are 280 dollars and the 180 regular link buds which have kind of an open ear concept these are 199 so that's what they think are going to be the mid range but i would argue that anybody considering getting the 1000 x mark fours might be just as happy saving the money and getting these in fact many people might even be happier because although you're making some subtle compromises on some of the high-end features or sound quality or active noise cancellation these are really really close in almost all regards also costing 80 less and most importantly the earbud itself is substantially smaller which to me i think is a really important part of a good pair of earbuds so if you guys have any other earbuds that you think i should compare these to let me know i know it's a really competitive space at the 200 price like this the beats fit pro are there jabber elite seven pro are there galaxy buds pro there's a lot of earbuds at that price and there's also a lot of earbuds below this price that would be very compelling for example the galaxy buds 2 although they don't sound as good and c is a little weaker they are also a really small pair of earbuds or maybe something like the sennheiser cx plus but in conclusion these i would say are really an incredible pair of earbuds i love the way they sound they're very small they're very comfortable the compact design i know i keep saying this but that's one of the biggest positives with these the fact that you're getting great anc great sound quality and a lot of features in such a compact design that's still giving you six hours of battery life i think is really a huge win for these but it's also a really competitive space so anybody looking to buy these i mean there's a lot of other earbuds out there that are really competitive but the good news is we are in a way approaching peak earbuds so anybody who buys these i seriously doubt you would have any regrets and i don't think you'd be even tempted to upgrade until these end up breaking sometime way down the line in the future so share your thoughts in the comments below and let me know what you think of the linkbuds apps if you enjoyed the video consider liking and subscribing i'm mike o'brien thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music]
Sony Linkbuds S, yo what's up everybody it's your boy floss back again with another video and today we're going to take a look at the sony link buds s now you can pick these up online i'll throw the link up in the description the price on these 200 bucks i repeat 200 bucks now they come in three different colors you got black white and the best buy exclusive desert sand all right so let's go through the specs real quick now these are supposed to be the lightest earbuds with active noise cancellation now you got bluetooth version 5.2 the codex is sbc aac and ldac no aptx now these are ipx4 sweat and water resistant you got five millimeter drivers with the v1 processor so that's going to give you dynamic sound and excellent anc now you got built-in mics for crystal clear phone calls with wind reduction you got touch controls for playing pause skipping reverse tracks answering and phone calls and you do have your voice assistant now you got active noise cancellation and transparency mode and all of the new sony features like speak to chat weird detection and adaptive sound control now the battery life on these is six hours on a single charge with an additional 14 hours using the charging case now you do got fast charge five minutes to charge will give you one hour worth of playtime and you also have an app that's available for android and ios and let you customize your eq settings and play with some of the other features all right so all that for 200 bucks what's missing there's no wireless charger in the case no multi-point connection so you can't pair two devices at the same time and according to what i'm hearing you can't use either earbud independently now i'm going to test that out for myself now at the end of this video i'm going to answer three questions number one are these worth 200 bucks number two let's compare them to some of the other sony earbuds like the m4s and the link buds original link beds and my final question what should you buy these for 200 bucks or one of my favorite earbuds for under 200 bucks the sennheiser cx plus all right first things first shout out to white shoes back in the building [Music] calm down yo she calm down immediately all right all right no doubt okay so let's recap real quick sony m4s these are the absolute best earbuds for active noise cancellation all right these are god tier noise cancelling ear buds the absolute best now as far as sound quality i do like the bnos the sennheisers the bowels and wilkins the gemini's there's a few earbuds that sound better but none of them can match these for anc okay 280 bucks now sony link buds originals okay now there was a lot of controversy when i did this video let me say this again these are the absolute best earbuds for ambient sound mode and transparency mode look at them they got a big hole in the middle no computerized ambient sound mode is going to be better than having a big hole in your earbuds but the sound quality in these alright the sound quality on these in my opinion is trash but i still love these for what they're made for they're made for ambient sound mode and i give you two perfect examples of why i never got rid of these all right because a lot of people wanted to buy them after the video no i'm keeping these i do love them for ambient sound mode now the other day i had to go to the doctor you don't have to go somewhere and you go in the waiting room and they say have a seat and wait till we call your name you want to play your music but you don't want to miss your name being called these were perfect for that scenario i sat down in the waiting room i had conversations with people in there i could hear them calling people's names from far away the ambient sound mode is incredible but the downside if you're gonna rock these for daily earbuds you're gonna have to carry two pair buds same scenario when i left the doctor's office i got into an uber the guy was playing his music he was talking on the phone i couldn't hear my music at all all i can as his pachata he was playing pachata music arguing with his girl on the phone i could not hear my music at all and i was so pissed off okay but i'm keeping these i perfect for ambient sound mode but the sound quality they're not loud no bass it's just trash but if you work in an office and you want to listen to music and do your work if you got kids uh you babysitting if you want to work out in the gym and have conversations with people go run in go bike riding outside and not get hit by a car these are the best ambient sound mode buds and they're super comfortable the sound quality is just trash all right that brings us to the sony link buds s now these should be right in the middle the same kind of fit all right because these do have the best fit super comfortable the same kind of fit as the link buds but now the v1 processor you're going to get active noise cancellation like the m4s so right in the middle all right so let's grab a little unboxing knife what we got today zombie killer okay here we go all right shoes watch those whiskers let's see what we got here today okay sony link buds s okay and your level's increasing all right there it is okay now one more side note too another reason these link buds are so dope fellas you're watching some scumbag videos and you want to enjoy the sounds okay you know what i'm talking about but you don't want your girl walking on you beating your meat buy a set of link buds i trust me not speaking from experience this is what i've heard okay sony link buds s okay let's see now this is the eco-friendly packaging no plastics all made from recyclable uh automotive parts all right if you're into the environmental protection uh stuff i like that again recyclable paper very flimsy okay now the case now this is another thing that i didn't like about the link buds although i am for saving the environment all of this plastic recycle stuff it just feels cheap it just has a cheapy feel to it you know you spend 200 bucks you want your case even if it's going to be plastic you want it to have that nice matte feel a little bit of weight to it this one just feels a little bit on the cheap side same thing with the link buds not a big deal just you know one of my pet peeves if i spend money on stuff i like to have that quality feel you just have a cheapy feel to it like you see with the link buds you see when you oh little drop test you see when you press the button you see how it kind of it just has a wobbly feel to it you know it just feels cheap just feels cheap okay let's see what you get inside now this is going to be your okay a couple of boxes in here this is going to be your usual books and [ __ ] pluck them and follow them you got 360 reality audio with these you do have dse extreme upscale your music a bunch of different size ear tips now this is very important okay make sure you find the right size that fits you're not going to achieve excellent active noise cancellation if you don't have a nice tight fit giggity so make sure you do that now this one comes with usb type-c the usb-a charging cable not that long y'all only getting one giggity per video okay calm down damn all right here we go so this is the link buds s okay now let's see how they look okay now i will say definitely small and lightweight and these are my kind of earbuds i love earbuds that are discreet looking okay now these are supposed to be the smallest and lightest uh earbuds with anc and they definitely feel ultra lightweight now just for comparison let's pull out the original sony's the m4s you can see the difference okay now the m4 is a lot bigger and you could easily feel the weight right a lot bigger with the weight difference but of course you're getting bigger ear buds you're getting the extra more uh more noise cancellation now with the link buds s let's see the link buttons s and the original link buds now my fingers are so big i want you to be able to see this bro what are you doing here's the difference okay so here's the link buds and the link buds s okay now with the link buds this is the best fit you're gonna get all right these fit in your ears so perfectly and one more thing i hate to keep talking about the original link buds but this is what video is all about comparisons one of the main issues that a lot of people was having with these was the fit all right you if if you can't get the right fit with the original link butts they're gonna sound even more trash than they are now when you put these in your ear if you dig them into your ears and press them down they will sound better but you shouldn't have to do all of that for ear buds you you really just want to pop them in and get a good fit these are very finicky in the fit department so i wonder am i going to have the same issues with these now i'm going to play with different size ear tips and we'll find out shoes shoes plotting on these earbuds okay back in the case there it is all right so let me pause the video i'll grab a phone we'll pair these up and then we'll start our usual testing talk amongst yourselves all right josh we'll be back in first let's take a look at the charging case super lightweight made out of plastic again not the most premium feel to it borderline cheapy feel on the back you got your bluetooth pairing button usb type-c charging slot on the front you got your led indicator and that's pretty much it no branding at all i like that now let's check the magnet strength first we'll start off with minimum shake edge okay no movement intermediate shakage no movement maximum shakeage ah okay excellent strength on the magnets now let's take a look at the actual earbuds and i'm gonna have to agree with sony these might be the lightest earbuds with anc super lightweight okay it almost feels like there's nothing inside of these five millimeter drivers you could barely feel them okay so the earbuds if you're looking for lightweight and all-day comfort these are right here i super duper lightweight now let's take a look at the sony headphones app now it shows you the name of your product you've been powered on and off now you got a picture of the earbuds you got the battery percentage for the left the right and the charging case now this is the status tab you got adaptive sound control now i'm going to leave that turned off but if you turn it on it'll automatically adjust to your environment you got your music controls playing pause skipping reverse tracks and you can raise the lower the volume now the sound tab you got ambient sound control okay so this is going to be your active noise cancellation you got ambient sound level one all the way to 20 and if you want to you can focus on voice or turn it off to save battery now you got speak to chat i tried that out on the m5s i love that feature we'll play with it in a minute now my favorite feature from sony headphones and earbuds the customizable eq this will make the difference for you now if you want to you see my custom eq settings but you do have manual you got speech bass boost treble boost vocal relaxed mellow excited bright you can turn it off and you got two different custom settings now here's mines okay you got your 360 reality audio setup you got your bluetooth connection now if you want to you can prioritize sound quality or stable connection now i'm in the house with wi-fi so we're gonna go with sound quality if you go outside and you want better connectivity prioritize stable connection okay so let's go to system now you got your voice assistant you can have google siri or alexa okay you got your touch sensitive controls for one tap double tap triple tap or long press you can customize those up okay now same thing with the button on the left that's for your ambient sound mode and transparency mode you can customize that too okay you get your optimal earbud fit you got your automatic power off that's your standby time you got your weird detection pauses when you take the headphones out blue resumes your music when you put them back in the earbuds okay you got your voice prompts and you got your software download and for services that's all your 360 reality audio services and your spotify all right so the app is simple and straightforward all right so i just put these in my ears now let's talk about the look the fit and the feel first let's put on ambient sound mode okay now we'll do the ambient sound mode test now the ambient sound mode on this is extremely robotic okay now i can hear everything perfectly clear you can tell us a lot of computerization going into this yeah the ambient sound mode works good but it's very robotic but it works it definitely works i don't have to yell now as far as the fit again these earbuds are so lightweight they feel great okay super lightweight and comfortable matter of fact let's do the head shake test i'm going to start off with minimum shakeage okay no movement intermediate shake edge no movement maximum shakeage no movement at all now let me show you how they look okay now again these are my kind of earbuds very discreet okay very discreet and i can't stress this enough these are comfortable all right very comfortable and again the ambient sound mode it your voice does have a lot of robotic sound to it but it works alright that's what you want you want to be able to hear stuff i'm here i'm tapping my little fingernail on on this paul i can hear every sound alright so now let's do a little sound test all right so i got a classic song cued up we got mob deep win or lose i'm going to start off with max volume my custom eq settings and active noise cancellation turned on all right here we go i'm going into this with an open mind birdman hands rubbing together i promise y'all i'm not going to sing here we go okay so far nice amount of volume here come the bass drop here i go again whether i win or lose okay okay now not too heavy on the base nice amount of volume nice highs and mids let's try this let's go to uh eq okay that's off we'll do break okay it's like oh time to go shopping be the same [ __ ] that we had on [ __ ] looking cute save that for the broads okay okay all right let me go back to my setting okay all right all right all right let's hit pause all right one time for playing pause now again y'all know i got a love hate relationship with sony and i gotta keep it real the sound quality is okay it's not blowing me away now it's light on the bass even with my custom eq settings and bass boost i'm going to try another song matter of fact before i even if i even talk too fast let's do our nip to absolute blue laces too let's just put this to rest right now let me do a real bass test okay just to make sure all right here we go here we go okay okay interesting interesting okay okay all right it's okay it's okay smoking they know that you know i got to get the mogu they know that part that you know once i hit that board then we can stop all right let me be honest with y'all the sound quality in these is pretty good it's pretty good now is it 200 good i'm gonna test it out against the sennheiser cx plus these sound pretty good now i would say the selling point of these so far is the fit okay now you got to look at it like this you're going to take a little bit of hit with the sound quality because the drivers are so small on this but they got to fit them into that small lightweight package so these are it's just like the uh link buds okay you got to know what you're buying when you're buying stuff okay don't buy these looking for extra base earbuds all right you buying these for transparency mode same thing with these you're not buying these for the necessarily the top of the line base and sound quality you're buying these because you want to wear them all day long you want to adapt the sound control and you want thin and light earbuds trust me when you put these on you're going to notice the difference in the lightness as opposed to the m4s these are big heavy earbuds and after a while you're going to want to take them out to relieve some of that pressure these i can easily see wearing all day long okay they pass the head shake test with flying colors yeah and they're very comfortable as far as the sound quality the highs and mids excellent the bass is there it's there but it's just that if you're used to heavy bass earbuds you're going to be like all right these sound a little hollow like not hollow they sound a little light that's the word now i don't know look i'm not an audiophile i never claim to be i don't know all the uh music terminology as far as oh this song sounds narrow this song has the high transducency i don't know all that fancy terminology the easiest way for me to explain how these sound they sound like a watered down version of the m4s they sound a little light a little light like volume i'm not going to complain they're nice and loud but the bass could be more it just could be more bright it could be more it could be more in it that's that's the best word i can it's missing a little bit of it's not going to knock you out of your chair but they sound great already 200 is great i don't know let's do the rest of the testing we'll test the call quality we'll test the lag and let's uh go through some of these other gimmicky features i say gimmicky but let's see if they actually work all right so let's do the reconnection test how long do these take to reconnect to your phone after you take them out and put them in the charging case here we go okay fully in the case wait for it to fully disconnect there it is okay here we go one mississippi two mississippi three mississippi now i just heard a bring in the earbuds and it just popped on i said that's three mississippis all right so now let's confirm if these don't pass the one air blood test can you play music from one earbud while the other one is charging up in the case let's say playing the music okay now i'm gonna take out the left ear bud drop it in the case let's hit play okay so the right side is still playing okay let's put the left side back in wait for it to reconnect okay just connect it let's take out the right side drop it in the case let's hit play on the music the left side is playing now i don't know who said you can't play one earbud at a time but that's completely wrong okay now look let me hit pause in the music i shouldn't even said that at the beginning of the video and shout out to this i was gonna i was gonna really say something negative let me let me just say my man peter all right because he's a he's a [ __ ] noob my man peter called me from last night from best buy like floss mentioned my name in the video because i just found out that you can only use one earbud at a time like if you can't use either earbud independently alright so pete you wanted me to mention your name in the video he's a [ __ ] noob you could definitely use either earbud independently watch i'm going to put the left side in let's hit play on the music the music is playing let's put the right side back in okay the right side connected with the left side in the case let's see playing the music the right side is playing i pete you you noob got me out here looking silly i know see this is why i don't ever take people word for stuff i like to test stuff out live you can definitely play music from either earbud while the other one is charging up in the case okay that's the end of that it does work all right so let's check the touch controls now on the right earbud single tap for playing pause answering and phone calls okay there it is double tap to skip to the next song okay there it is triple tap to go to the previous track okay there it is long press for voice assistant what's the weather for tomorrow okay so all of the touch controls work and on the side note if you single tap on the left earbud that'll activate transparency mode single tap again that'll turn on noise cancellation now let's check the call quality let me call up amaya okay link buds now i'm one of my trap numbers let's see if she answers got max volume all right let's see she may not answer because this is the trap number oh boy here we go hi girlie what took you so long to answer the phone bro i'm come on man what you said you napping oh come on man you i ain't gonna i go i great you're living the dream all right check all right check this out i'm doing a set of headphones you know the routine how do i sound sound good nice and clear are you you you have sleeping are you up okay okay let's check it all right now i'm gonna do the wind test okay i need your honest opinion do you hear any wind no win right now okay what about now you don't have no win okay okay hold up this is max you don't have no win now you serious all right what about uh now you're here okay i'm about to say cause you you cabin cause i got i got the i got the the fan right by my ear you you hear it now okay but is it bad though no oh you can't be fine i hear you fine too though okay i know okay yo um you're leaving on friday right oh i'm saying i ain't saying where you go i'm not putting out some time inside nobody where you're going to say you're leaving a friend calm down bro god i'm not the option i'm sorry i'm not the ups not cause i went out i was actually i wanted to invite you to the dinner tomorrow oh now we're not i'm not the hops anymore now okay oh now i'm the code d now okay all right now chill all right so i'm all right so i'm gonna call you back when i finish this i gotta go pick up my car so i'm gonna i'm gonna call you from an uber all right girlie bye okay okay call quality sounded excellent on my end she said i sounded great and one thing that blew me away yesterday or the other day when i did the sony m5s the wind reduction is great on sony products same thing with these okay now she didn't really start hearing the fan until level three and i had to put this in my ear i had the fan like this then she was like okay i had some wind but just regular wind this would be like me riding my bike even when i ride my bike you don't get this much wind in your face like that she was able to hear me fine we had a little conversation with the wind on okay so core quality on these excellent all right so now let's test for latency and what i mean by that is when you're watching the video is there any delay from the person's lips to what you hear okay so of course i got larry david lampen okay no delay yeah no delay at all perfect for watching your videos all right so now let's try speak to chat now i just enabled that feature and i'm going to turn my time until the mode closes to five seconds okay so let's hit play on the music okay now i'm gonna start talking okay now the music just paused it automatically put me in transparency mode i can hear my voice perfectly fine now i'm gonna be quiet for five seconds and wait for the music to turn back on okay now as soon as i start talking okay you see it just pause and i can hear my voice perfectly i love this feature now it's definitely not a gimmick i could see this coming in handy if you work in an office or if you got kids now for me i like to sing along with my music so this is not going to be good but it should be perfect now see how i was at work i'm talking to my boss right now yeah i'm going to have those reports ready for you by three o'clock okay no problem music is playing all right he just walked back in oh what you said oh yeah one more thing okay okay oh yeah i i'll remember all right i got you we'll wait for the start playing again let me be quiet for five seconds that's pretty dope alright that's pretty dope and it just paused again all right speak the chat is not a gimmick i love it all right so now let's try weird detection now keep your eye on the music playing i'm going to take the earbuds out of my ears you see the music pause now i'm just going to put them back in music started playing instantly okay so the weird detection works all right so now let's talk about ambient sound mode and active noise cancellation now as far as ambient sound mode on these they work perfectly no issues at all i'm just kind of spoiled because i've been using airpod pros for ambient sound mode for so long that i judge everything based on those but these are pdg pretty damn good i'm not going to complain the ambient sound mode works perfectly you just got to get used to sounding like a robot but who cares you can hear everything around you and you can have your conversations okay i like that now let's talk about active noise cancellation i did two tests all right i did the car test and of course one of my favorite tests the baby okay now if you work somewhere imagine you working somewhere and you got this sound in the background are you on the flight you trying to listen to some mob d imagine trying to listen to this song with that in the background let me turn it off that's already getting under my skin you know flossing little kids but i hate the sound i hate that sound alright so i did my active noise cancellation test outside and indoors and i would rank these as follows okay now y'all know i got three tiers we got trash tear okay tear and top tier and of course god tier now you're not gonna find too many god tier earbuds or headphones i would rank these as top tier okay these are really good i have really good noise canceling headphones or earbuds whatever you want to call them but they're definitely not the m4s i they're definitely not the m4s in terms of sound quality and noise cancellation not at all now just to solidify my opinion i'm gonna do a quick side by side test with the m4s and with the link butts s and we're gonna rank these but again ambient sound mode works no issues and active noise cancellation is top tier okay you could block out a lot of them not all of it you could block out a lot of the baby crying okay now with the with the m4s you don't hear nothing okay with these you're still gonna hear a little bit of the baby crying when i went in my car i can hear a little bit of the engine rubbling but not as much i not as much as you know cheap noise canceling headphones or no noise cancellation at all just music so they do work so noise cancellation i would rank these as top tier but definitely not m4 tier now let's do a quick side by side comparison all right so i just did some thorough side by side testing and here's my results now as far as sound quality the sony m4s sound the best now just because something is the most expensive doesn't always mean it's going to be the best but this is one of those times where the most expensive product wins all right the sony m4 sound the best then the link butts s as far as the original link buds for sound quality meh borderline trash okay now for ambient sound mode nothing that i've ever used beats the sony link buds and i'm talking about the bose frames now those are both frames the sunglasses with the speakers above your ears that's that's that's the ultimate ambient sound mode because there's nothing in your ears but you can't hear the music either as far as earbuds that really go inside of your ears and give you ambient sound the link buds are the best only buy these if you're concerned with ambient sound mode or transparency mode do not buy these based on specifically music uh listening now as far as around sony link buttons s where do these fit in exactly where they're at in the middle okay you got the same comfort that you're gonna get with the link buds okay so both of these super comfortable and you got some of the noise cancellation from the m4s not the god tier but top tier so let's go ahead and slide these to the side i would rank these right in the middle now this is going to be my last question matter of fact let's answer those three questions matter of fact let me do a quick test before i do that i want to find out which ones sound better the sennheiser cx plus or the sony link buds s now i just did some more testing and just like i thought the sennheiser cx plus blew the sony link buds s out of the water in terms of sound quality the sennheiser sound better they got better hides in mids and way better bass okay now as far as active noise cancellation both of these are top tier i would rank them about the same but the sennheiser cx plus 150 bucks the link buds s 200 bucks now the only difference is not the only difference other than the sound quality the size okay look at the difference in size so again if you're looking for earbuds that are thinner and lighter and you're going to rock them all day you want something a little bit more smaller and discreet spend the extra 50 bucks and go with the link buds s but if you just want a quality pair of noise cancelling earbuds okay that sound great for under 200 bucks i'm still going with the sennheiser cx plus let's go ahead and wrap this up all right so let me answer those three questions number one audi's worth 200 bucks and the answer is yes and no now for me i would say no okay i don't wear earbuds all day long i'm looking for the best sound and the best noise cancellation i could get these ain't it but i would say yes for somebody that works in an office or you work somewhere where you're going to be wearing your earbuds all day you got to put that into the equation these are some of the most comfortable earbuds around so if you're going to be wearing them for six seven eight hours straight you're gonna you don't mind spending that extra 50 bucks you want something that's going to be comfortable you don't want some big giant earbuds like these you don't want something heavy like these you want something that's lightweight that's going to give you good transparency mode and good active noise cancellation and sound pretty good so no for me i for me i want more bass i want more noise cancellation so i wouldn't spend 200 bucks on these but if you're gonna wear those for eight hours straight then these are worth 200 bucks for you next question how do these rank versus the m4s and the link buds again m4s top tier god tier noise cancellation actually the best noise cancellation on the market but a little bit heavier the link buds best transparency on the market but the sound quality is a lot less these rank right in the middle okay right in the middle of the sony lineup i just wish these would have been 150 bucks then it could have been direct competition with the cx plus which brings me to my last question which one would i personally choose the cx plus or the uh link buds s for me i want bass okay so i'm going with the sennheiser ch plus but i don't have to wear earbuds for all day so i don't really care about having the thinnest and lightest earbuds you might care about that okay so if you're wearing these all day long and you're worried about comfortable earbuds that are lightweight you're gonna love these all right but sony i think i should have bought these out at 150 bucks and i woulda gave these a triple major go just for the comfort alone but right now i'm just gonna give these a single major all right these are major go anyway sony link buds s hit me up in the comments let me know what y'all think about these shout

Sony Linkbuds original, hey there these are sony's new link buds and i gotta say i was a bit surprised when i first got my hands on them for starters they have an actual name you can easily remember and not some funky model number and then there's the whole ring thing kind of weird right let's talk about that [Music] so as far as the name goes sony says the concept behind the link buds was to make an always-on product to link your online and offline worlds i'm not quite really sure what that means but the idea is that these buds are supposed to be really comfortable to wear around all the time while not shutting you off from the outside world that's where the ring comes in these are open earbuds like the standard airpods so they allow ambient noise in but in some ways they're more akin to samsung's galaxy buds live earbuds aka the beans because they have a stemless design and although they're not exactly kidney shaped they are elongated they come in two color options speckled white and speckled carbon and sony says both the case and buds are made out of recycled plastic which may be a first for earbuds they cost 180 dollars i'll get into weather i think they're a good value toward the end of the video but they're basically in line with what the airpods third generation and galaxy buds live cost when they first launched i'd say the one big advantage these have over both the airpods third generation and the galaxy buds live is that they're designed to stay in your ears really securely i was actually able to get a good fit with the buds live and a pretty good fit with the air pods 3 but i've seen plenty of comments from people who couldn't get the buzz live to stay in their ears and not everybody can get a secure fit with the air pods which is why you see all those airpods winning accessories selling on amazon the link buds come with five different sizes of fins or arc supporters as sony calls them medium is the default size but there's also extra small small large and extra large the large and extra large worked well for my ears and the thin wedges under that top ridge on your ear and helps lock the butt in place i wouldn't say these lock in quite as well as the beats fit pro but they're arguably more comfortable particularly if you're someone who doesn't like having an ear tip jammed in your ear it's pretty self-explanatory how the buds fit in your ears but the app does have a tutorial that shows you how they're supposed to fit what's interesting is that the way the ring sits in your ear it's partially hidden so people can't really see it from the outside anyway it just looks like you're wearing regular buds you may not totally forget you're wearing earbuds and they may not fit everybody's ears perfectly but i found them quite comfortable to wear from time to time i did make little adjustments to how they sat in my ears and how the ring is positioned in your ear can impact sound quality slightly you can tweak this out a bit in the companion app for ios and android but changing the eq settings doesn't dramatically change the sound profile engaging bass boost for example only gets you a touch more bass these use sony's v1 integrated processor which is its version of a bluetooth system on a chip it's bluetooth 5.2 and like the sony wf-1000x mark iv the link buds unfortunately do not support multi-point bluetooth pairing that feature allows you to connect the butts to two devices at the same time like your smartphone and your computer and easily switch audio back and forth between the devices sony says these have 12 millimeter drivers and the buds are ipx4 splash proof i got some shots of them in the rain was a little worried i might have gotten them a little too wet but after i dried them off they worked fine so you can definitely use them for workouts and runs and they did stay in my ears when i ran with them these are not noise-cancelling earbuds and they don't have a transparency mode because they're naturally transparent if you pause your music it basically sounds as if you're not wearing earbuds [Music] the link buds do have a few extra features and a couple of them are pretty cool these have ear detection sensors so when you take a bud out of your ear your music automatically pauses and then resumes when you put the butt back in your ear and yes you can use a single bud for audio listening and leave the other one charging in the case if you want the buds have touch controls and they work just fine but what's cool is if you want instead of tapping on a bud you can tap on your face just in front of your ear sony calls the feature wide area tap and you can turn it on or off in the companion app it's two taps to pause your music and three taps to advance the track you can also set taps for volume controls the link buttons also carry over sony's speak to chat feature found in its wf-1000x mark 4 buds and wh 1000x mark 4 over ear headphones that's the feature where if you start talking to someone your music automatically pauses so you can have a conversation with them music then resumes about 15 seconds after you stop talking if you talk to yourself a lot or maybe talk to your pets too much you might want to turn the feature off in the app it does use up a touch more battery life when you have it on battery life with these guys is rated up to 5.5 hours at moderate volume levels so it's not stellar but the case does provide a couple of extra charges and has a quick charge feature that gives you 90 minutes of playback time from a 10 minute charge how do these sound well good but not as good as the wf-1000 xbox 4 and they fall a tad short of the airpods third generation which offer improved sound from the airpods second generation they have a nice open natural sound well balanced with good detail and just enough bass but like a lot of open earbuds they just don't deliver the same kind of bass response as a set of noise isolating ear buds and while they have sony's dse digital sound enhancing feature that does make your music sound a little fuller there's no support for sony's near lossless ldap codec like there is with the wf-1000x mark iv they also have the same issue that all open earbuds have in noisier environments they let sound in so whatever you're listening to competes with whatever ambient sound you encounter for a lot of people that's a feature not a bug for safety reasons you often want to hear the outside world but you should be aware that despite having an adaptive volume control feature that automatically adjusts the volume to your environment some folks may have an issue with how loud these play i paired them with an iphone 13 pro and the google pixel 4 plus and stream music from apple music spotify and quobas there was some variation volume levels across devices and streaming surfaces and i do think how your ear shaped and how the speaker ring sits in your ear can affect volume levels some people may think they play plenty loud while others may not particularly when you're outdoors when you're dealing with competing sounds including wind noise [Music] sony is targeting the link buds at jen's ears and i guess it doesn't want to kill younger peeps ears which i do appreciate with my ears anyway the airpods 3 play a little bit louder and had slightly bigger sound overall so did the galaxy butts live but those can distort a bit at higher volume levels as i said sony's wf-1000x mark iv have these beat for sound quality but weirdly the link buds are better for making voice calls sony won't say how many microphones the link butts have i see only one external one on each butt but it says it's improved the noise reduction algorithm and callers told me they thought my voice sounded clear with minimal background noise in the noisy streets of new york city so these in fact have surprisingly good voice calling performance i just hope sony brings that same new algorithm to the wf-1000x mark iv with a firmware upgrade all right so i got some traffic going by here it's pretty noisy in the background hopefully you can lean pretty decently yeah your voice is coming in super clear right now don't really hear much going on i'll finish by saying that i'm generally impressed with what sony has done with the link buzz and that's not just because it gave them a real name open earbuds are difficult to do well and these definitely have an innovative design not only are they very comfortable to wear but they stay in my ears well and even if they don't play quite as loud as i'd like in noisier environments they do sound good for open buds and i am a fan of the speak to chat and wide area tap features these are an excellent alternative to the airpods particularly for android users who can't take advantage of some of the airpods apple only extra features like spatial audio if you just have trouble keeping airpods in your ears they do have google fast pair the link butts are a little expensive at 180 but i do think there's room for some discounting while they feel premium enough they're missing features like wireless charging and both the case and buds don't quite feel as solid and substantial compared to what you get with the wf-1000xmark4 so like the galaxy buds live i think you'll see the street price on these come down fairly quickly but let me know what you guys think does the link buzz design seem appealing to you sound off in the comment section and if you found this video informative at all hit the like button and subscribe if you haven't

Sony Linkbuds original," The Sony LinkBuds are weird buds. They go against the trend of wireless noise
canceling earbuds by embracing an open design where ambient sound is let in, allowing you
to hear everything in your surroundings. After six months of using them, my general
feelings towards them are a bit mixed and let's walk through why that is, who I think
these earbuds are actually for, and if in 2022, you can really justify paying $180 US
dollars for earbuds that don't have any noise cancellation.For the past 6 months, the main
thing I’ve used my LinkBuds for are phone and video calls at work because their mic
quality is pretty good. Here's how their mics sound compared to some
other common earbuds I have. Alright, and first we're gonna start off with
the Sony LinkBuds. This is how their mic sound and this is the
best they're like, they're probably ever gonna sound. I'm in a pretty quiet room right now and I'm
recording this on my studio display, not with the studio displays mics, so these are the
LinkBuds mics and then just recording it in QuickTime. So let me know how you think their mics sound. Alright, and these are the brand new Sony
LinkBuds S. They're noise canceling earbuds and this is how their mics sound. All right, and these are the WF-1000XM4s. This is how their mics sound. Let me know what you think, and these are
the brand new Google Pixel Buds Pro. They’re noise canceling earbuds at a great
price point. This is how they're mic sound. All right and these are of course the classic
AirPods second generation. This is how their mic sound.I’ve also used
them occasionally for listening to music in the background when I want to still need to
be able to hear what’s going on around me Or if I want to make myself available to talk
to others in my household, but in general, these situations are uncommon for me. Typically I prefer using noise canceling earbuds,
especially in noisy environments, because I don't have to turn up the volume as much
as on a pair of earbuds, like the LinkBuds.They do feature adaptive volume control but I never
enable this feature on any earbud because of health concerns. Hearing health is something I try to be very
conscious of so I don't typically want earbuds where I have to crank up the volume to a pretty
high level just to be able to hear music or a podcast. This is why I typically will gravitate towards
earbuds that are in ear and have noise cancellation. Although, there are a lot of people out there
I know that don’t like the feeling of noise cancellation.. If that's you, these buds may be more appealing
to you, but I think you should still ask yourself the question: do you want earbuds that make
no effort to block out any outside sound?or would you prefer something more like the The
Google Pixel Buds which are in-ear earbuds that let in ambient sound, but because of
their design, they do attempt to block out some sound by creating a light seal in your
ear. Now, one thing that may sway your answer to
that question is sound quality.The sound quality on the LinkBuds is decent, but not best-in-class
by any stretch and this is due to that open design, the highs and mids, they're fine. But because these earbuds have such an open
design to them, you're basically going to lose out on all bass and because of that,
I wouldn't really recommend getting the LinkBuds for just listening to music. Now when it comes to music controls, the LinkBuds
also leave a lot to be desired. You can go into the Headphones app which Sony
uses to control all of their headphones, to set what you want the double tap on each bud
to control, but in a world where other earbuds like the Pixel Buds Pro and Sony WF-1000XM4s
exist and allow you to play, pause, skip tracks, trigger a phone assistant and turn on and
off noise cancellation, the LinkBuds’ limited control options, leave a lot to be desired. Another thing that leaves a lot to be desired
with the LinkBuds is their case, for $180 dollars, I think anything in this price range
should have a case forward to wireless charging,The LinkBuds case only supports USB-C for charging. Now, one thing Sony did an excellent job with,
with the LinkBuds is comfort. These earbuds are extremely comfortable. There are two main reasons for this, one,
the earbud’s speaker sits outside of your ear canal, which is a design that will inherently
be more comfortable and second, they include a stabilizer arc loop that helps the earbuds
stay in your ear. It’s made out of a very flexible elastic
material, allowing it to conform to your particular ear shape and they come in multiple sizes. I've been able to wear these earbuds for hours
and they're very similar in their feeling to Apple's second generation AirPods. And that when you put them in, you kind of
forget they're in your ears. The battery life on the LinkBuds is rated
for 5.5 hours & 17.5 hours total with the charging case, And in my experience, 5.5 hours
seems about right when I've used these earbuds though, to be fair, I have not stressed tested
these as much as I would another pair of earbuds because they're not really suited for my needs
in terms of day-to-day earbud use. And this brings me to the obvious downside
to using the LinkBuds for normal earbud tasks. When I want to be able to block out as much
background noise as possible, these aren’t a good choice for that scenario. and more often than not, I find I want buds
that have the ability to block out noise because it helps me concentrate more on a podcast
or even when listening to music in the background because you’ll pick up on way more detail
in your music and I find the experience generally more relaxing. So now, let's talk recommendations, who do
I think the LinkBuds are for, and do I recommend them? And that’s a really hard question to answer
because I’m not really sure who these earbuds are actually for at this price. They do come with water and sweat resistance,
support for the Google and Amazon assistants and their mic quality and comfort are excellent. So if you want a pair of buds with great mic
quality, they’re great for that. however, you really have to love not being
able to block out any background noise at all. If that's you, you're gonna love these. But if you like me and you want earbuds that
have the ability to block out background noise, have great sound quality, and overall good
comfort, the Sony buds I’d recommend are actually the Sony WF-1000XM4s, which are still
my favorite pair of earbuds to use and we’ve done a review of them if you want to learn
more about those that I’ll link here in the video and in the description below. But the XM4s, they cost about $100 more than
the LinkBuds. Now, to me, it's been worth it, but if you
want something closer to the LinkBuds price that offers noise cancellation, take a look
at the Sony LinkBuds S which were released a few months ago for $200 US dollars,And we'll
have a full review of those earbuds out on the channel soon, so if you want to see that
review, make sure you subscribe to the channel. So those are my thoughts on the Sony LinkBuds,
they’re great for phone and video calls if you want a comfortable set of buds that
don’t block out any noise. But for anything else, I’d look at another
set of buds. If you're interested in purchasing a pair
of the LinkBuds , LinkBuds S, or the WF1000-XM4s, I've left purchase links here that you can

Sony Linkbuds original, so when it comes to sony products i've always appreciated them a little bit more when they add a little bit of that japanese authenticity to them and these the sony link buttons do this quite literally because these earbuds and charging case are encapsulated in a unique material made from recycled japanese car parts and natural stone and the end result is a soft touch hard shell with a unique speckled pattern and it kind of has this organic feel to it like a smooth stone washed up on a sandy shore and because of this eco-friendly manufacturing process no two sets of sony link buds will have the exact same pattern which makes each and every set of link buds unique and i think this is a great design feature because you don't want to be like everybody else do you and it's also good because sony is recycling cars that are no longer on the road in order to pave the company's road to a zero environmental footprint by 2050 and this could mean the playstation 8 could look like origami and of course sony's eco-mindedness carries over to the packaging as well it's 100 free of plastics and even 8 smaller in volume compared to the already incredibly eco-friendly xm4s packaging and you might be thinking this is unlike sony surely these earbuds should be called the mdr-1156 oem ones or something like that but they're not these are simply called link buds and the thinking behind the name is that these buds are designed to merge your offline world with your online world whenever you're using it but anyway that's enough backstory let me explain why the sony link bars are completely different from every other true wireless earbuds on the market today sony has created what i believe to be the world's first open back earbuds the innovative ring driver used inside the link buds are 12 millimeters that's nearly double the size of the drivers used in the wf-1000 xm4s and the xm4s are widely considered to be one of the best anc earbuds you can buy right now and i will tell you how these sound in comparison to the xm4s so stick around for that but think of the link buttons in a way as the opposite of the xm4s you see the xm4s are designed to block out the noise of the world around you with class leading active noise cancelling whereas the link buds are designed to keep you aware of the world around you allowing you to engage in conversations and daily tasks without ever having to take them off and they've even got an official ipx4 rating so a little bit of light rain won't be a problem for the link but and here's a true story on one occasion i jumped in the car i started driving and i was driving for about 15 minutes before i realized i was actually wearing the link butts so based on that experience i'd say sony have done an excellent job at designing the link bars to fit seamlessly into your daily life and sony have described the new link buzz as a marvel of miniaturization and rightly so the link buds are around 50 smaller in volume than the xm4s and approximately 45 lighter and this is precisely what you need with an always-on set of earbuds and that is what sony are calling these always on earbuds but that isn't exactly true because at some point or rather you're going to have to recharge them and when you take them out of your ear they do have wear detect sensors so they will automatically switch off and save power and when you put them back in they will spring to life again but on the topic of power the earbuds themselves have five and a half hours of playback time with the charging case adding an extra 12 hours of power and of course you could double your playback time by using these one at a time as a sort of old-school hands-free headset and if you chuck them in the case for 10 minutes you can get up to an hour and a half of playback if you're in a pinch and the case is also reduced in size by 26 compared to the xm4s case which means it easily passes the cowboy pocket watch pocket test [Music] so this is all sounding good but you're probably wondering what is it actually like to use them well i've been lucky enough to have tested these out for a couple of weeks prior to the launch and i have to say the fit in the ear is unlike anything i've ever tested before sony say they've been analyzing ear shapes ever since the days of the walkman in 1982 and it's this data that they've used to shape the link buzz to sit perfectly in your ear and this must undoubtedly be another world's first i've never seen anything quite like the fit here on the link buzz but check this out there are five different size supports in the box which kind of work like little elastic springs it's up to you to find the right size for your ear and when you eventually find the correct size support it should ping into place inside your ear and if you do decide to get a set of these i do recommend you get a mirror and make sure you find the exact fit for you because this is crucial and once you do get it right the link buds are very comfortable and easy to wear for long durations your ears won't start to sweat or anything like that so my personal opinion on the fit is it's kind of a loose fit because the ring driver is only really being held in by gravity and the shape of your ear with a little bit of support at the top with the elastic spring support thing so because of the loose fit i'd probably not recommend these for any kind of vigorous workouts however with that said they'll be perfect for weightlifting or cycling and stuff like that and to be honest with you i don't think sony had sports in mind for the link buds when they created them i believe these are purpose built for more office environments or work from home environments where you need to be more productive and i say this because sony seemed to have focused quite a bit on the voice call quality so the great thing about the link buzz is you can engage in online meetings whilst being able to clearly hear what's going on in the room around you in your surroundings so if someone starts speaking to you you'll still be able to hear them and that's thanks to the open driver design so when it comes to voice call quality and the mics on board it actually uses a machine learning algorithm that has a database of over 500 million voice patterns and it will use these to enhance your own voice and cancel out the background noise let me know how it's sounding to you and now let's simulate some wind rushing past the earbuds let me know how it's sounding now as if i was outdoors and it was a windy day and now we've got some coffee shop background noise in the background let me know if my voice is still being picked out clearly with that machine learning now when it comes to sound quality and how these compare to the sony xm4s it's actually a different kind of feeling you get from them they have this kind of airy clarity and it's this that shines through as the link buds real strength vocal clarity is impressive and instrumental details and nuances are present especially if you're in a quiet environment but if you're into loud volumes and heavy bass i definitely recommend the xm4s all day with that said i have found a way to make the sony link buzz sound much bassier and much louder but i don't think sony intended them to be used this way so in order to do this if you twist the link buds into your ear in an anti-clockwise motion and kind of lock them in place like that it literally doubles the perceivable base output but the problem is when you do this they're not that secure in your ear anyway that's a little trick that i discovered whilst using these and do you know what really takes the link buys audio to the next level it's the software combined with sony's v1 chip and onboard dac to this day i believe the sony headphone app is the most advanced and best app on any set of earbuds i've ever tried it brings so much to the table for example ldac for high-res audio playback the dse for upscaling compressed audio you've also got pop-up pairing that will work on google devices and you've even got google location services on android devices as well and there's the new adaptive volume feature exclusive to the link buds which will adjust the volume levels on the fly based on your locations and the surrounding noise levels the xm4s do a similar thing but with anc not volume and of course within the app you can adjust the eqs save your own presets or use the built-in presets there's also the speak to chat feature which is particularly handy with these earbuds as soon as you start speaking your music stops and when you stop talking it will switch back on again which is ideal for work environments and you can customize the controls as well and this is really interesting just like any earbuds with touch sensitive controls you can tap the back to play pause and skip but if you hold your finger down you can summon your ai assistant but with the new sony link bars the side of your face actually becomes part of the user interface and this sounds strange but it's true and it really does work and i guess the upside of this is you're not disturbing or dislodging the positioning of the link buds in your ear and you won't hear that horrible tapping noise loudly when you do it so i think it's fair to say the link buds are unique and i do believe they're not just all about working environments and i say this because sony have partnered with microsoft on their microsoft soundscape platform and nintendo with their app store and google store pikmin game and pokemon games so the idea is that the sony link buzz can also be used for augmented reality again linking the offline world with the online world using audio and if this sounds like an interesting topic and you'd like to see a video on it let me know in the comments below and i'll do my best to test out this feature more specifically so at the end of the day can i recommend the sony link buzz to you well the answer is yes if you're an apple android user and you're looking for a lightweight compact pair of earbuds that don't make your ears sweat and you don't need noise cancelling in fact you need the opposite you need to hear what's going on around you all the time and if voice call quality is a priority and when it comes to sound if you prefer clarity over volume and heavy bass then yes i absolutely can recommend the sony link bus so let me know what you guys think of the sony link bytes do you like the name or would you prefer the more old-school name would you choose these over the xm4s let me know in the comments below and if these don't seem like the right earbuds for you you should definitely check out my review on the xm4s especially if you're looking into noise cancelling earbuds and i appreciate you guys for watching this one if you got any kind of value out of this a thumbs up would make my day a subscribe would make my month and i'll see you guys in the next one

Sony Linkbuds original," - I'm really excited for these that the- - [Jono] Oh no, it broke. - [Brandon] Jono broke the
press kit it's not Sony's fault. (Jono laughing) - Way to go Jono. (Jono laughing) - [Jono] It wasn't my fault. - [Brandon] It kinda was though. - Oh, there's goo on it. The conventional wisdom
has always been that in ear headphones isolate
you from the outside world. And we've used technology to
get around that to a degree with things like transparent modes that use microphones to
pass through ambient sounds. But the LinkBuds take a
far more holistic approach to this problem with a shape that I would've actually never imagined ever seeing in an earphone. Unfortunately, I have no
idea how to open this box. - [Jono] Check that little cap
on your right. (indistinct) - This paper. - [Jono] Yeah that part. - [Brandon] Sheer brute force. - [Jono] Oh, he forced it. - Okay. Oh, please tell me it's not an NFT. YouTube sent this cringe
NFT display thing to me a little a while ago. Just didn't know what to say. Sustainability is extremely
important to us at Sony which is why the LinkBuds
and their charging case are made using recycled plastic materials and have plastic free packaging. Not the press version apparently. I swear to you, this thing's really cool. I can't get the box open. And then I can't get the other box open. But trust me, it's really cool. Oh, all right. Okay. This is actually pretty cool. It's all just cardboard padding. Like it. Very compact charging case. No wireless charging on the charging case, but it has a lot of other
redeeming qualities. USB C charging. There's your pairing button so
nice, simple pairing process. It's really small. Here actually hold on. I've got my AirPods Pros in my pocket. So you can see it's thicker
than the AirPods Pros, right? But in both other dimensions it's actually substantially smaller. Like other wireless earphones. The case acts as a charger,
holding 12 hours worth of juice while the earphones themselves
hold five and a half for a total of seventeen and a half. That should be good enough
for most people's long day. And if you want to top
up the earphones quickly, Sony quotes, 90 minutes of use off of a 10 minute quick charge. And then I believe it's 90 minutes total to fully charge the assembly. Now this is where the
similarities to other earphones pretty much die in a fire. Look at these things, Brandon. - [Brandon] That's so cool. - They've got kind of this bulbous almost figure eight shape. And you can see the
analogous components, right? Like here's the part
that goes into the canal. And here's the part that
sits in the little, like, you know concave spot in your ear, right? So relative to the AirPod you can kind of see how it's gonna sit. But it's got a hole in it. - [Jono] It's a donut. - This is what I meant when I said they've taken a
much more holistic approach. Get it? Pun very much intended. To making it so that you
can hear your surroundings. The driver is actually
a ring shaped driver around the outside here. So what they've done is
they've created a completely actually open backed in ear headphone. Okay, I'm gonna put it in. They've got these little silicone loops to help hold them into place. Hopefully my ears aren't too waxy today. So it kind of sits like that. One of their priorities for
this product was all day comfort with the being that because
they're not cutting you off from the rest of the world, you are able to wear them all day while still carrying
on normal conversations or safely walking around in the city and not getting, you know,
run over by a car or a train or whatever the case may be. I believe they've actually
partnered with Niantic. And they've talked about Pokemon go as a specific use case
for these headphones. They've also boasted that they have excellent
ambient noise rejection for the microphone. So if you wanna carry on a
conversation with someone, we'll have to do a test call with Jono. You gotta way to record it real quick. Actually okay, I guess I'm
not gonna use this phone. I'll use the one that is
preloaded with their application because these aren't released yet so you can't just grab
it from the app store or the play store. Thanks to Vessi footwear

$ 25 by visiting the link in the video description and
using offer code shortcircuit. Crap, Jono, you gotta
sign into your Apple ID. I gotta say these typing sounds are tripping me the crap out. Because I don't feel like
I'm wearing headphones. So you know how with some
headphones you get that like inside your skull sensation. - [Brandon] Yeah. - I'm definitely getting
that a little bit. They're very comfortable. I mean, obviously I haven't
spent an entire day with them and I actually sleep with my AirPods Pros and my Tone Free FP8. But they're extremely comfortable for me. I don't know if I could
say that about these yet. The XM4's from Sony I
found were a little bit too bulky for that. And the touch would often get activated by lying down on my pillow. So I wasn't able to do that with those, But these seem at least on first glance, extremely comfortable cause
they don't put pressure on the canal. It's all up here. They're really light too. Like extremely light. - [Jono] How are you doing today? - That's really weird. Just how, how do I describe this? - [Jono] Is it like I'm right there? - With the typing sounds
and with this phone call. It sounds like you're coming from like in between my ears. (Jono laughs) - [Jono] I'm in your head - Now this is interesting. The press deck for this
talks about wide area tap. Whatever that means. And it seems like the guy in the picture is like tapping his head. Whoa - [Brandon] That's cool. - [Jono] Whoa - Could you hear that? - [Jono] Yeah, I can hear that. (group laughing) - [Jono] I can hear that from here though. - That's crazy. Yeah. So that was one of the
things we asked Sony about. If I'm on the bus or
if I'm in a quiet room, will people be able to hear my music? The answer is sort of. Because they're in ears, what sounds loud to you is gonna be pretty quiet
for everyone around you, but because they're open backed there's no isolating layer
that will prevent sounds from leaking out of them. So yes, it's possible. They're also ridiculously loud right now. This is just the default. - [Brandon] Then it's
not that bad probably. - [Jono] Yeah. - You definitely have to tap with intent. This is what I would consider to be a reasonable listening volume for me when I'm not like jamming out,
but I'm sitting and working. Can you guys hear it? - [Jono] No.
- [Brandon] No. - No, okay. This is like, I'm cleaning
the house and I need energy. - [Jono] I think like a
little bit. (indistinct) - These sound great. - [Brandon] Better than the XM4's? - They're different from the XM4's. So the thing about the XM4's is that like most earphones they're
a closed back design. So even though you can run them in a transparent mode, right? That's always gonna be artificial sounding and there's always gonna
added background hiss or added artifacts from doing it that way. Whereas these are allowing ambient sound so I can hear the person who
opened the door over there. Hi, how you doing? - [Denniss] Hello.
- [Jono] Denniss. - But the music also has a
more open and natural sound. That's one of the key benefits
of open backed headphones when we're talking about
full size headphones as well. So if you like an open back sound these are just gonna
completely change your world. They sound really good. Oh, for crying out loud, you will not be able to listen to music while I go for through the app here. Speak to chat. You can start conversations
while wearing the headphones simply by starting to talk. Yeah. I wanna experience that. Try saying things like hello
while music is, oh, okay. So it pauses your music. Oh, that's really cool. It will resume while you are speaking and will close if
approximately 15 seconds passes after you finish speaking or
you've operated the headphones. I would make it less than 15 seconds. That seems like a lot. Although I guess if you're going back
and forth with someone. They've got some EQ presets here. Pretty cool. And then I believe you can also edit it. Very nice. I wouldn't mind if these
were a little more granular. This is cool. The ear shape analysis
thing, I've run this with previous Sony products before. It actually does appear to
make a small difference. - [Brandon] You know honestly I almost can't tell your wearing
headphones, with your hat. - Yeah. Cool, right? And they actually have what, I think a really cool look to them. Like I could see these
being a conversation starter when someone does notice
that you're wearing them. They've got support for
adaptive volume control. So if the ambient sound gets louder, they will try to overpower
it, If you're into that. Personally I think you should always control volume yourself to
keep it at a safe level. Wide area tap. Super cool. That was on by default. And you can actually
configure the tap operations. So there's no single tap because obviously that
would cause problems, right? If you just, you know,
accidentally slapped yourself for example, that might
start playing music. So it's only double and triple tap. That is one drawback
could see to this product is that you can't have as
many different functions, but because you can program the left and the right individually I think you can kind of overcome that. Four functions is a fair bit. I'm gonna turn the
screen recording off now cause I wanna listen to
a little bit more music on this puppy. Man. Other earphones
try to get this sound. With if like digital sound
processors and you know adding like an auditorium effect or like a open sound stage
wide sound stage effect. Nothing is ever quite right. But an open backed earphone. Now to be clear there are far more open back earphones. The regular AirPods, for example have a much more open back
sound than the AirPods Pros. But this is more open than
I've ever experienced before. I can say that definitively. There's a hole in it. It's open. I'm just talking to you. And what's interesting about that. Is that actually carrying
on a conversation with you is not as easy as an earphone like this in a specific transparent mode because they're using like voice detection to find voices around you
and amplify them for you and they're plumbing them
right into your ears. But this is more natural. These sound great for $179.99. - [Brandon] 179 US? - Yeah. They're like reasonable actually - [Brandon] Oh Man, I'm tempted. - Man, I'm not gonna be
able to daily drive them. Because ANC is actually a lot of what I use my earphones for. A lot of the time I'm not
even listening to anything. I just have the ANC on because I find my life
a little overwhelming. But if it was just about the
music, boy are these ever cool? - [Brandon] What about gaming? - Gaming's a tough one because I would say that
gaming is more about immersion than a lot of the other things that I do. But the funny thing is that I actually use open back
headphones for gaming. I use Sennheiser HD 600's because when I'm gaming,
when I'm in my computer room I don't have to worry about distractions or anything like that. I want the best possible sound. And for me, open backed is a
more natural, better sound. So I would absolutely use them for gaming but maybe when I'm out in public where there's distractions
all over the place where I want to dial in. Your mileage may vary though. Maybe you're on the bus and you like, need to hear the next
stop or the train, right? So you guys can check them out. We're gonna have the link down below and you can subscribe to ShortCircuit where we do first impressions

Sony Linkbuds original, sony have sent me over a pair of their new link buds these are wireless bluetooth in-ear headphones or earphones or earbuds i'm not sure how you prefer to refer to these things but you know exactly what i'm talking about it's a well-established market by this point i've got a image of these ones spinning around on the screen behind me but it's your usual thing you've got a charging case you take them out of here they pop in your ears i mean i really thought there wasn't much that you could offer that was different in this space now i thought we'd pretty much seen everything you could do sony had different ideas though they've made these ones with a hole in the middle i'm just putting a wire through them now so you can see how that works now the idea with that is the reason they've got a hole in them is to let ambient sound through normally with headphones you're trying to block out the sound around you or you're inadvertently doing it with these very much the opposite they want the sound that's around you to come through so that you're fully aware of your surroundings at the same time you're listening to the audio from your device over bluetooth now i've had these things for a couple of weeks now so i've had enough time to form some pretty good opinions about the positives and some of the negatives about them so i'm going to talk about that in this video now as usual we're going to have chapters in the video so if there's a particular section that you want to jump to make sure you use those but let's get on with it [Music] now first off if these were just normal bluetooth in-ear headphones i really would not have been interested in reviewing them because i'd have very little to say about them but it's the fact they've got the hole in them that's what makes them interesting to me because it ties in with some things i've made videos about before you may have seen some videos i made about bone conducting headphones i've got a pair here and the idea behind these is very similar to that of the link buds they allow you to hear your surroundings as well as the audio that's coming through these over bluetooth the difference is that these send the audio down through your ear canals eventually via bone conduction and that's kind of vibrates your cheekbones and as a result of using that technology the audio is a little bit thinner it's a bit more compressed into the middle it's fine for speech i listen to audio books and podcasts through these it's my preferred way of doing that but when it comes to music they're a little bit lacking in that regard and that is something that should be improved by the link buds because they're using a normal speaker driver rather than try to vibrate the sound down through your bones and another disadvantage of the vibration technology is a lot of people just can't abide by it um i'm fine with it but i've tried these with a number of different people and some people put them on they go don't like it they don't like the feeling of the vibration next to their ears and they just can't wear them at all and a third issue with these headphones is that they have a band attached at the back here that connects both sides and that prevents you from lying down while listening to them it pushes them out of position not a massive deal but if you wanted to lie down on the sun lounge you are listening to an audio book you couldn't do it with these so all of those things are resolved by the design of the link buds but before we go into the pros and cons of these i just want to talk about the stats [Music] okay now all these specs and more will be available on the sony website but just to give you some headline features from them first off the link buds themselves they weigh 4.1 grams each which is very light i think it's been designed with the intention of all-day wear in mind now as a result of that and perhaps because they've also got a hole in them maybe the battery can't be as big because they provide five and a half hours of playback time between charges now that's plenty for me but for anyone that's comparing them with other models perhaps in the soda range i think there are other ones that provide a longer battery life but they're probably a little bit heavier and bigger than these now to recharge these of course you just pop them in the case the case itself holds 12 and a half hours worth of charge so you can charge your earbuds a couple of times in here before you have to recharge the case via usbc now if you just wanted to do a quick charge 10 minutes of putting the earbuds or the link buds in here will give you an extra one and a half hours of playback time the link buds themselves ipx4 certified that splash and sweat resistant the bluetooth is 5.2 so it's to date so i think that's pretty much the most recent one into it but it doesn't mean you can't use older devices with it i'm using an iphone 10 and they go back of course way before then as far as the color goes you can get these in white or dark gray it should be noted that the plastic i think is some kind of recycled material because you do see little specks of a darker color in the white i think a lighter color in the dark gray so if you see those on the video that's why they're there it's not that i haven't cleaned this thing it's just in the plastic itself and the cost of these well i've been told they're 150 pounds in the uk and a hundred and eighteens in euros now as far as the fitment goes they're a little bit different to some other in-ear buds rather than having a silicon tip on here that jams in your ear of course these are just resting against the inside of your ear so they've got a little rubber piece that hooks underneath one of the ridges in your ear now of course because everyone's ears a little bit different they provide a variety of sizes of these it depends on how high up the hoop goes to make sure it fits behind that ridge now as far as fitment goes i've gone through the various different sizes of these things they're quite easy to swap out to to get the right size whilst i feel that i've got the correct size now i also i'm not 100 confident that if you were doing something strenuous it wouldn't fall out but again that's with my ears your ears might be a little bit different [Music] now i'm sure there are plenty of people watching this video who are wondering why why would you ever want to be able to hear your surroundings at the same time you're listening to your personal audio device surely you want to block out the sound of your surroundings well it very much depends on your situation when i was commuting every day on the train i had noise cancellation headphones on i didn't want to hear any of that nonsense i just wanted to be lost for all the 45 minutes or so in podcast music whatever that's fine in that situation but there are other people in other situations who need to still be aware of what's going on i've heard back from plenty of them over the years there have been people who perhaps work on a production line in a factory it's a repetitive job as a result the boss has allowed them to be able to bring in their own personal audio device listen to that during the day to help pass the time listen to podcasts audiobooks music whatever but the rule was that they were only able to listen through one ear at a time they had one ear bud in the other one hanging down so they could hear out of the other ear for anything they needed to be aware of such as an alarm going off an announcement a forklift truck reversing towards them that kind of thing they didn't want to be blocked out from their surroundings it was dangerous now as a result those people tended to listen through one ear in the morning and one ear in the afternoon now with these things if the boss allowed it they'd be able to put both of them in they could hear their audio being played back in stereo but they'd also be able to hear their surroundings in stereo that's a safer thing if you hear a vehicle approaching you it's a lot easier to determine when you got both ears available like this which direction it's coming from now personally around the home i tend to listen to audiobooks and podcasts through earphones as i walk around the house and in the past i did use for a couple of weeks my noise cancellation headphones to do this and as a result i ended up missing a couple of parcels where people had knocked on the door and i just hadn't heard them and i found the card later on to be posted through that said sorry you weren't in which was a little bit frustrating of course when i switched over to things that made me to hear my surroundings at the same time that's never been a problem again but over the last few years the most common place where i've used my bone conducting headphones has been in the car and that's where i'd use these they're of course regulations are different around the world so i'm not saying that everybody could do this but i've found that if you have a load of podcast queued up which is what i tend to do to pass the time on a long journey and also have the sat nav on because it's given me instructions about detours and road closures and things if you have those both on together the sat nav is always jumping in and cutting in on your podcast and you'll be going up to a junction or something they'll probably read out ten different things in a row and by the time your podcast comes back you completely lost track of what was going on so i only found that i just q upload a podcast on my phone listen through this i can also hear the sat nav and i can also hear any kind of emergency vehicle sirens or whatever that were coming past and i've also found that the sound of listening to a spoken word podcast audiobooks through your car stereo it gets a bit tiring a bit too boomy over time whereas with something like this not a problem now these devices also have built-in microphones and there's supposed to be some kind of noise cancellation type feature so we'll test that out i'll go out for a drive now and i'll record something and we'll see how it sounds through the microphones in these earbuds okay now this should be a pretty good test because i hold the votes away i'm in a 50 zone at the moment that's why i'm going so slow the background noise in here is really quite substantial this isn't a very well sound insulated car so hopefully my voice is coming through nice and clearly you're listening to the audio that's been recorded in the voice memo on my phone at the moment now i'm going to stick that in with the video that you're looking at but we can also for a comparison we can switch across there so the original audio that was recorded by the camera it's the same camera that i used when i was parked up earlier on and hopefully that's given you a good comparison between the noise cancellation mode of the link buttons and what a normal microphone would pick up that didn't have any kind of noise cancellation feature now when i first got these out of the box i charged them up connected them up to the phone over bluetooth everything was working just fine however once i loaded up the sony headphone app i found that i got access to a load of additional features and configuration and it was stuff that was really quite valuable so i'd definitely recommend downloading the sony headphone app it's for ios or android and to give you some examples of the things that you might want to switch on or or for configure well first one is it has an ability to have a speak to pause feature on these not on a standard but if you turn it on if somebody was to come up to you and you start holding a conversation your music playback device automatically pauses and then when the conversation stops after whatever period of silence you've set in the app it will resume again now that might not be something you want but it might be and you'd only be able to access it once you get that sony headphone up another thing is automatic volume control you can switch this on and if your ambient sound around you increases well the volume level of your link buds will increase as well and then there's the various taps to do various things which is something you really probably will want to configure for example you could do different things on both sides two taps for one can command three taps for another so two or three either side i've got two on here to set it to pause or resume three skip tracks this side double tap will increase the volume triple tap will decrease the volume but you can configure how you want those to operate or you can switch them off entirely another thing you can do is have a larger tap zone you can select this option and rather than having to tap directly on the earbud itself which can get a little bit noisy if you sort of tap it on your ear you can have it so that it will sense if you're just tapping on your cheek here but with all these things after you've used them for a while you might find that they're features that actually are more annoying than they are useful and i found that with quite a few though so let me go into some of the potential issues [Music] now this is the first thing that sony have ever sent me and of course because i sent it for free i put the paid promotion thing on at the beginning but they're not paying me to make this video i've just got some free earbuds out of it hopefully they'll send me stuff again in the future but we'll see after this because i'm gonna be completely honest here i'm not in the sales business i'm not trying to sell these on behalf of sony i'm just talking about them and i've got to be i said not really my cup of tea i don't like earbuds i i would never go out and buy a new set of earbuds now i've tried quite a few over the last few years and what i've come to the conclusion of is that i just can't cope with having anything in my ears anymore years ago back in the 90s without a doubt for like a i don't know cassette watman or a mini disc or something i seem to be fine with them and then maybe i don't know my ears have changed i've got older but now i can only really wear proper headphones i just find anything inside the ear really annoying and uh with these it's it's perhaps worse because with the ones with a kind of soft tip on them that you shove into your ears i think i could wear those a little bit longer than these with these having a hard plastic section that pushes against the ear there's just no cushioning at all and i find these perhaps more annoying than i would most earbuds and also because there's a thing that once they're in there if you're chewing or eating or whatever you feel them inside your ears i just don't like it but i know other people do i know there's plenty of people that used to go around with the old white plastic ear bud things off the ipods they seem to be perfectly happy with them so i'm sure there'll be plenty of people that will find these perfectly comfortable but i'm not one of them so i can't comment on the comfort too much i've also had quite a few stereo dropouts on them now that was a bit of a surprise now of course yeah i've got to go through the usual it's pre-production uh it might be early firmware blah blah blah blah yeah that kind of stuff but still i've had stereo dropouts i'm not going to say i haven't just for a second but you're listed so they'll just quickly like one will go and then come back again very quickly and in the app you can select whether or not you want them to have uh the priority for the connection or for the sound quality and i've had it on the priority for the connection so it should be as good as it gets and still i've had sound droplets so that's with my smartphone which is an iphone 10 shoved in my pocket and these here it's not exactly far to travel so i don't know what's going on there um i tried wearing them all day because that seemed to be like the idea of these things and i also had it set with that wide tap you know double tap on the cheeks type of thing because i i really like that initially i thought that was a great idea just so tap here to pause and start um and then i found out that while i was eating me lunch uh i was starting stopping the audio all the time the actual motion of me chewing my food or drinking or whatever it was just starting to stop it so i ended up switching that feature off and another one that i switched off was the one that will do these little pulls to talk because i found that every time i clear my throat coughed or even quite a few ambient noises around the house those would uh make the thing pause which was irritating but again i mean these features aren't like life or death the things you can switch on or off it doesn't matter uh i'll switch that one off and as far as the tap thing goes well you can still have it work if you tap on the earpiece itself rather than on your cheek so was it such a great deal of a a loss and then um this one might be a bigger loss actually a more costly one this case it's really slippery i mean he's designed i think to sort of feel like a pebble in the hand nice and rounded and smoothed off but the little button to open it up is really low down on here and you kind of hold in like the very bottom of it and you can imagine these things just flying out of people's hands you're someone stood on a station platform and they're trying to open this up but it just shoots out and ends up down on the uh on the track just a little bit difficult to grip you do get the hang of it after a while you kind of have to hold it on the sides and then kind of do some pincer movement on it but still yeah maybe it's a bit of a form over function there and then finally let me just pop them in again the um there's the cultural aspect i mean the idea is you wear them all day you speak to your voice assistant you do telephone calls you don't have to take them out to talk to people all that kind of stuff but i think there's a cultural thing that will would you walk up to somebody wearing these and start up a conversation with them or if somebody wearing these started a conversation with you would you be thinking hmm that guy's not really paying full attention not such a big deal again but i'm just thinking that it's a bit of a cultural barrier that might need to be overcome for these things to become accepted in society but we've done that before we played two things with headphones and stuff so people get used to stuff but uh yeah i mean initially i remember when somebody was on a train and they had a walkman or never looked at them like they just arrived from outer space so you you get the you get used to these things but still if it's just a one company with one product it might take a little bit longer to get used to some than some other things so yeah there's a few things i found to be potential issues [Music] okay now let's talk sound quality now i'm sure there are some people thinking why did i leave this part so late in the video there'll be some that have just skipped this chapter as well but the reason that i've left it this late is because if sound quality is your number one priority you should not be buying link buds because it wasn't their number one priority when they were making these things obviously it was on the table they don't want them to sound terrible i'm happy to say they don't sound terrible but what i'm trying to say is if you're only really interested in sound quality then you want to get some big old headphones that block out the outside world these are a different kettle of fish these are something that let in the outside world and they reproduce your audio and they do it to a decent standard but they're not going to blow anyone away that said the music reproduction on these is a lot better than the quality through my bone conducting headphones so it's a step up from that as far as spoken word reproduction which is what i've used these for mostly it seems to really hit the spot on that very nice quality of reproduction it's almost like tuned for that kind of area but it's not lacking at all when it comes to music i'm happy listening to music i have to say though out of the box it didn't sound quite right to me and i went since the app went through the different eqs and none of those really kind of seemed to hit the spot either but i went into the configuration part of that and moved the sliders myself got them where i wanted them and now i'm really happy with the sound quality as far as the music reproduction as well so yeah i'd happily listen to these all day long playing music they don't seem to get tiring in the way that some others do uh so yeah no no issues at all really one thing i will say is that they do have a 360 degree capability the sony thing and that's linked in with various providers of streaming services none of which i'm a subscriber to so i couldn't comment on that but i'm sure that works just fine as well [Music] so in summary i do like the idea of the link buds as a whole pun intended it's just that unfortunately they don't seem to be fully compatible with my ears but really it's more like my ears aren't compatible with any kind of earbuds but i am trying to build up some kind of resistance for these that tells you something about them the fact that i do want to be able to wear them i like the idea i think that someone has achieved what they set out to do the issue with the bluetooth connectivity just dropping out a little bit on the stereo that is very possibly something that could be improved with a firmware update and this is a very early version it says not for sale on the back of it just the other day i've got some sony headphones i've had for a while and they got a firmware update for improved connectivity so it doesn't seem to be something that is uncommon so if they sorted that out and i could get used to them yeah i'd be wearing them around the house most of the time so there you go those were the link buds that's all the information i've got on them i've had a few weeks with them and from that make your own mind up but yeah thanks to sony for sending them over anyway but of course you've got this massive long advert as a result so uh everyone wins right that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching [Music] [Music] you
Sony Linkbuds original, so sony has just launched a fresh new pair of true wireless earbuds a very unique pair indeed and no they're not the latest wf model they're rather actually a completely new brand called the sony link buds these are a pair of truly open in-ear headphones allowing you to have a conversation and be aware of your surroundings while simultaneously enjoying your music or that rogan fella telling you that scientists are injecting you with their jizz juice for shits and giggles or whatever else you fancy according to sony their new link buds are your perfect partner wherever you go pretty sure they just described a hip flask there but whatever maybe these will be a close second they'll be released soon for 150 quid or 180 euros and i've been testing them for a couple of weeks now so question is are the sony link buds actually worth picking up for that premium price point well here's my full review and for the latest greatest deck please do pog subscribe and ding that notifications bell cheers so let's start as always with the design and you can pick up the link buds in a choice of just two colors white or black nothing too exciting i'm definitely quite digging the design kind of looks like a soft mint glued to a hula hoop certainly very unique but the best part is they are incredibly light and really really comfortable to wear even if you have them lodged in your lug holes all afternoon long they're only 4.1 grams each so to be honest you can have them in there for hours and forget you've even got them in you've also got a flexible arm bit which just nestles up against your ear flap and helps to hold the link buds firmly in place and the arm comes in five different shapes and sizes as well you can easily swap them out to replace it with a different one so you should be able to find one that suits you no worries and of course with that open-ear design the sony link buds are basically meant to sit in your ears all afternoon long you don't have to keep on whipping them out every time you want to have a conversation with someone you can just stop your music or your podcast or whatever chat away leaving them in there and then resume your audio again once they've buggered off and quite often it is that constantly taking your buds out putting them back in again that can result in a lot of ear fatigue so you definitely do not get any of that with the link buds and they're also ipx4 splash resistant as well so noise if you want to rock them out in the rain found that particularly handy when i buggered off up to sunderland for the weekend and the sun part of that near definitely a complete misnomer the sunnylink buds support bluetooth 5.2 connectivity got fast pair and android phones as well which worked to charm setup took literally a few seconds and i thought i could easily repair the sony link buds with a different android device or whatever else if i needed to as well but of course whether you actually get on with the sony link buds or not depends on your feelings towards that open ear design they are absolutely ideal if you want to rock them in a workplace or somewhere else where you need to be aware of what is going on around you so for instance personally i found that they were fantastic when i was at home expecting a courier to turn up any moment usually i have to just like play my music quietly so i don't miss the doorbell but with these things i could listen to a podcast listen to music anywhere i roamed about the house and i could still hear the doorbell when it finally went off they're also pretty good if you've got a sprog for instance constantly making demands of you so you're not having to constantly switch on awareness mode or take out one bird to actually hear what they're wibbling on about this time although of course in those cases you might prefer a bit of active noise cancellation however when i tried using the sony link buds when i hit the high street or when i was trying to travel somewhere by train or by tube for instance just i just gave up straight away basically podcasted audiobooks had to jack up to the maximum volume to actually hear what on earth was being said music just you can't really hear the finer details at all as well because of course you're getting all of the surrounding noise filtering in so these things are definitely made to be used indoors or in quieter environments that is for sure i certainly couldn't use them as my full-time pair but they are great as a backup when needed now certainly one of the funkiest features of the sony link buzz is the touch controls because you don't actually tap the buds themselves you can just tap your face just in front of the buds instead and it just works flawlessly as well literally double tap your left cheek and your music will pause double tap your left cheek again and it will resume it just works every time flawlessly it's utterly bonkers you might be thinking yeah sure that's very snazzy and all but it's actually the bloody point well i found it really handy actually if i was wearing a woolly hat or whatever to protect my baldy bones from the elements you can pull that down up over your ears and then just tap on your cheeks when you need to control your tunes or whatever i only ever had a problem one time with the touch controls and that was when i was rather vigorously chewing on a double decker and my music just suddenly paused and i figured that was probably down to my jaw motions but i tried replicating it and got bloody nowhere it was just a one-off basically the controls are fairly comprehensive as well you can double tap your left cheek to either pause or resume your music you can triple tap in order to skip forward a track meanwhile the right cheek is reserved for assistant functionality so a double tap allows you to speak to the assistant and make your demands and a triple tap will get the assistant to read out the current time and also give you an update when there's any notifications waiting around for your attention and if you happen to think that the google assistant is a load of old bollocks well you've also got full alexa support on the sony link buzz if you prefer the amazon effort now sony has chucked in a few familiar features with the sony link buds as well so for instance you've got that speak to chat which you can enable or disable within the sony headphones app if you're not aware of this feature basically just pauses whatever you're listening to when the headphones detect that you are speaking unfortunately there's somebody who likes to jabber on to himself cursed to himself and occasionally have a bit of a sing-along with whatever i'm listening to that feature really does not work for me so yeah just kept that knocked right the off the entire time you've also got an auto volume feature which can lower the volume of your music or whatever again if you enter a quiet environment but as i mentioned before i wouldn't recommend using the sony link buds anywhere but a quite quiet environment so it's again not really essential and as usual that's funny headphones app includes a built-in equalizer as well with various presets you can enhance the the vocals the bass whatever you fancy i'll just have a manual tinker around with if you want that's for the actual audio quite an important part of it all well this is powered by a 12 mil ring driver and you've got sony's v1 processor on there which offers up features like the dse sony's digital sound enhancement engine to improve the clarity of lower res audio you've got support for 360 audio yada yada as well and the sound quality is pretty decent the only problem with the open-ear design is that it doesn't feel like the sound has actually been pumped directly into your ears more than it's been played around your ears so it doesn't sound quite as full bodied as what you would get with just a standard pair of true wireless earbuds you know i found the sony link buttons were great for podcasts great for audio books for that sort of shenanigans as well and music is fairly enjoyable through these things as well although if you want that sort of really full-on intense musical experience then definitely go for a proper pair of in the earbuds instead oh yeah i actually remembered to trim my ear hair before shooting this video as well for a bloody chain so all these close-ups and everything hopefully not too much ear bush action going on there you're welcome now fun with the sony link buds i got around five ish hours of audio playback on a single charge before the buds needed to be recharged again so not far off sony's on estimates and not bad at all for true wireless here but it's about sort of average and when they have given up the ghost way you can just pop them back inside of their highly adorable wii case you'll get a couple of extra charges from the case before that also needs to be powered up in a few minutes and the case will give you an hour of playback the case itself is actually made up from broken up recycled car parts blended with elements of stone it's environmentally friendly and i've got to say it feels absolutely lush as well it's got that sort of lovely textured finish to it but also strangely smooth kind of like a bizarrely light pebble and also it's just utterly charming compared with most of the true wireless earbud cases look at how dinky it is i mean this thing will slip into any bag or pocket or let's face it bodily orifice without any complaints whatsoever and it is well and truly cat proof as well the number of times this thing has been battered off of my table by one of my cats the only problem is that when it hits the floor does tend to pop up and despite the fact you've got the little button release thing there and then the buds go flying off everywhere and then when the the case itself actually needs to be recharged as well because it's run out of battery where it's just type c usb port around back as well you've also got a little button there for repairing so there you have it that in a nutshell is the sony link buds fresh new pair of truly innovative true wireless earbuds certainly not for everyone best used in quieter indoor environments where you need to be aware of your surroundings like a workplace if you're waiting for the doorbell something like that as i say can be yours soon for the princely sum of 150 quid or 180 euros but are you tempted it'd be great to hear your initial impressions down in the comments below please do poke subscribe and ding that notifications bell for more on the latest and greatest deck and have yourselves a bloody fantastic rest of the week cheers everyone love you [Music] you

answer one important question which one should you buy these are the sony m4s 180 bucks versus 250 bucks now i never tested these before i never heard about them so i'm going to go into this with an open mind but here was my thought why buy these for 180 bucks when you can buy these for 250 and have active noise cancellation now i understand these are designed for people that want to wear these all day so you have work and you want to hear your environment that's cool you can buy these and turn on ambient sound mode but then at some point you're going to want to leave work and go on your commute maybe you're taking the train or the bus or you're in your car you're going to wish you had active noise cancellation that's my original thought now i'm going to see if my uh if that thought changes at the end of this video and let's see if these are really worth 180 bucks or they just kind of a gimmick all right here we go first things first shout out to white shoes back in the building under the table so no theme song for you today here we go sony link buds let me grab a little unboxing knife shout out to the zombie killers here we go okay sony link buds here we go okay angle

okay of course you got dse for upscaling use your books and get those out of there let's see anything else okay there's a lot of filler in this pack okay are there any different size ear tips okay angle levels at max okay that's it so nothing in here just a lot of filler okay so let's follow that to the side rock okay now as far as the charging case super small okay just real quick comparison here's the difference in size okay let's go ahead and pop these open okay now you got a little button right here okay now okay white shoes is back so we got to give it a theme song ladies and gentlemen white shoes is back in the building let me show off my nightmares and shoes came in late [Music] calm down all right here we go sony link buds let's try that button again okay you got a little led hit that button i choose i'm getting that a button okay i thought it was gonna be like a nice you know one of those smooth button presses let's try that from the side okay just pops open like that okay a little flimsiness but not too bad now for the earbuds themselves look at this unique design i see a lot of people call the knees the sony donuts and i see why kind of does look like a donut okay all right shoes is in rare form let's drop these back in the case let's see now go like that go like that bong just like that now let's do a quick size comparison here's the m4s now totally difference in the size the m4s are a lot bigger with the link buds you do have that little little fin on the top that's supposed to help keep it in place again very unique design now i'm really curious to see if these pass my head shake test let's see in the inside little uh right and left brandon let's see how easy it is to remember how to put them back in the case let's say you put them donut down all right so just remember to put them donut down in the case simple enough okay so let me pause the video i'll grab a phone and then we'll start our usual testing talk amongst yourselves all right josh i'll be back in first let's take a look at the actual charging case like i said a lot smaller than traditional sony earbuds case feels like it's made out of recycled plastic has that kind of flimsy plastic feel to it doesn't feel too cheap but definitely not ultra premium like the mw08s now as far as that button it does work the top is a little little flimsy like i said but it doesn't feel too cheap you got your led light that let you know your battery indication on the back you got your bluetooth pairing button usb type c now as far as the magnets let's do the shake test we'll start with minimum shake edge okay no movement intermediate shakeage no movement maximum shake hitch no movement at all excellent strength on the magnets now for the earbuds themselves again take a look at the donut designs i'm going to slap these in my ears and we'll do the important head shake test okay so i got them in a nice comfortable field now they do have voice prompts okay so it did say power on i like that okay so i got them nice and snug now i'm going to start off with minimum shakeage okay no movement intermediate shakeage okay no movement maximum shakeage okay let's see nope now it's crazy because it felt like they moved but it didn't move i think it's because of the open ear design i'm hearing my surroundings completely so i'm hearing my hair hit the side of my ear so it felt like they moved but they didn't move at all let me try that again extra maximum shakeage ah okay no movement now these are surprisingly comfortable let me show you how they look let me take a quick picture okay here's how they look in my ear you see how they sit right in the canal definitely a unique look but extremely comfortable now this is crazy because i review earbuds all the time and whenever i get to this segment of the video when i put them in and i start talking i notice that i have to start talking louder because even earbuds without a and c once you put anything in your ears you're gonna you're gonna hear less sound so you you're naturally gonna talk louder so right now i'm talking a little bit louder but i'm realizing that i don't even have to i can talk my regular voice this is crazy now it it feels like i have earbuds in but not in my ears this is a weird feeling but i like it though it's a weird feeling and i like it okay so this again this is this is how they look now you can see me back here smiling i'm i'm literally liking these so far okay now i'm gonna be honest with y'all i did not have high hopes for these because with open ear i'm assuming that the sound quality of the music is going to be trash but the call quality is probably going to be great that's what i'm assuming but like i said i got a completely open mind all right so i got them in my ears now the next thing you want to do is pair them up okay so you're going to go to your bluetooth menu once you put these in your ears they'll automatically be in parent mode select the sony link butts then after that you're going to have to download the sony uh music app once you open them up it's going to look like this okay so i got them all paired up here's the app so it shows you your battery percentage now let's see can we show the case oh no okay we can disable that if we want to leave that so you got left and right 41 each let's see i got some music that i was listening to earlier let's go to sound okay so you got speak to chat so basically that what that means is when you listen to music if you start talking it'll pause your music let's see um enable speaker check let's turn that on let's see voice detect sensitivity automatic time let's see 15 seconds now 15 seconds that seems like a long time how about five seconds so this way if you listen to your music and somebody's like yo what's up yo what up if you if y'all still having a conversation y'all both to be talking but as soon as you say hey what's up all right see you later five seconds later your music will come back on now i'll leave that on for a minute but i'm probably going to turn it off because y'all know matter of fact let me turn that off because y'all know i like to sing occasionally in my videos okay now the classic sony eq y'all know my favorite setting excited so i'm gonna leave that on excited but again i'll play with some different eq settings okay so you got your 360 reality audio we got to analyze your ear shape i'll do that off camera because that usually takes a minute you'll see bluetooth connection quality now you can prioritize that if you want dss dse basically what that is if you listen to a lot of soundcloud or youtube with a lot of songs that haven't been mixed in official studios and you want to upscale that music like me i listen to a lot of old dj clue tapes somebody just uploaded them to youtube you want them to sound a little bit better turn on dse okay now you got your spatial sound optimization okay you can measure that if you want let's see you got your activity and your notifications now let's see there's one more thing i wanted to see let's go to system okay adaptive volume control and i usually leave that off because i like to rock max volume and i don't need sony turning me to tell it down all right let me say that again telling me to turn it down okay obviously tap the change functions let's go to settings okay so now this one you tap your ear so let me show you what i'm talking about when you want to change the music you tap your in front of your ear you're not going to tap the ear butt itself you're going to tap that little space right there like that you see my hair okay so let's see for the left you got double tap for playing pause on the triple tap let's see can we customize this playback control okay you can just so you can change it to playback control volume control song select song voice assistant amazon elixir quick access are not assigned so i'm gonna leave it stock so we got double tap for playing pause triple tap for the next song on the right earbud okay it's the same so for the right earbud let's see we'll go ahead and change this one to volume control all right so double tap to raise the volume triple tap to lower the volume that looks good okay so we'll leave that on done let's see automatic power off let's see wide area tap we'll leave wide area tap on automatic power off let's see um yeah i might as well leave that on pause when headphones are taking off here we'll leave that on too notification and voice guide leave that on automatic download software yes yes yes and there's all your services soundscape spotify okay simple enough okay so basically touch controls on deck so that's what the app looks like now of course we got to do one of the most important parts of this video let's do a little sound test and i'm going to test some music so let's take it over to apple music why not we got one of my classic songs like i said i was just listening to earlier oh matter of fact let me do this um headphone optimization test first so i can go into this with my headphones completely set up all right so i just finished doing the software update and doing all the optimizations and all the air tests everything is ready to go now i got a classic song cued up we got 93 to infinity souls of mischief i had them on some old school today double tap the side of your cheek for playing pause i got the itchy set to break max volume and i promise y'all i'm not going to sing all right here we go birdman hands rubbing together and again the crazy thing is i i feel like i'm talking loud just out of habit but i don't even have to talk about it i can hear everything around me crystal clear this is like ambient sound mode extreme like literally i can hear shoes purring under the table this is ridiculous i can hear my nail on the table it's like you're not wearing earbuds but how does the music sound that's the most important question here we go double tap for playing pause okay now just tap the side of my cheek and then a little boom boom okay the music just started okay now it is extremely low let me hit make sure this is max volume yeah this is max volume okay all right dollars on the digits cola bridgette amanda all right now i'm gonna be honest with y'all the music sounds super low super low hmm am i going to say trash the music does kind of sound like trash it sounds like if i'm wearing earbuds and i got the volume set to two two or three now it sounds like the best ambient sound that you ever heard in your life because i can literally hear everything but the music sound quality sounds horrible oh it sounds super low this is crazy all right let me try something let me try something i'm going to take it over to nipsy hustle blue laces too y'all know i'm a bass head this is one of my bass test songs let's try this one okay nipsy hustle blue laces too okay baby okay here we go i'm gonna wait for that bass to roll in wow talk about underwhelming [Laughter] look man y'all know me man i got a love hate relationship with sony products oh let me let some of the music play okay yeah the bass sounds horrible the music sounds super low like i said i got a love hate relationship with sony products this is probably why they never sent me any products to review which i respect them for that because y'all know me i gotta give it to y'all real and my real opinion on these is the music sounds like trash all right the music sounds super low super low now look i understand the point of these earbuds is you can listen to music while you're at work you know what you know what i would say these sound like if you ever seen the bose frames same kind of idea like you want to listen to music while you're at work so you're at work and you got your computer typing you got people talking phones ringing you don't want to have the music loud i understand that all right i completely understand that but say now you act working at you at work at home at your desk nothing's going on around you you might want to pump up the volume your favorite song comes on all right okay blue laces just dropped i want to make this a little bit louder this is max volume all right now look i'm down here in complete quietness and the music sounds low and trash imagine if i'm outside walking around and people are talking people are laughing in the background you probably won't even be able to hear the music i gotta be honest with y'all i do not like the sound quality on these let me take it to one more song let me throw on something that that really really pumps i've been listening to a lot of drill music lately let me throw on some um let me throw on some be love okay if you know you know okay let's get max volume okay here we go let's try this again yeah like i said this is the supreme ambient sound mode now okay look don't get me wrong i can see why a lot of people would like these i could see why people would like these because i used to work in corporate america so these would have been perfect i would have been rocking these all day long so it's like having your theme song on at work all day long they are super comfortable and again if you compare ambient sound mode from sony or even my favorite ammo sound board from the uh let me say that again my favorite ambient sound mode earbuds are the er the airpod pros those have perfect ambient sound mode you don't really get that computer robotic voice even with perfect ambient sound mode on a set of regular earbuds that have active noise cancellation they're not going to sound like ambient sound mode on these because of that open ring design basically every sound is coming into my ears so i'm listening to my music and i'm still talking my regular voice volume i can have a full conversation with somebody and they won't even know that i'm blasting some bee love in my in my ears at the same time i do like that part okay so let me let me let me go ahead and clarify myself these are the supreme ambient sound mode earbuds that i've ever heard but as far as the music okay you're buying these because you want to listen to music also because if you just care about ambient sound mode get a set of bose frames at least look cool while you while you're listening to music these let me put the music back on yeah it just sounds like it sounds like it sounds like if you're playing music from your phone say say say you're at work and you're playing music from your phone but you got the volume on three and you just put it next to your head like that that's kind of like what it sounds like it it's the music it sounds like trash like it really doesn't sound like oh the music no one would buy these specifically for the music no one i if you if you're buying these just for music you don't care about ambient sound mode do not do that i do not do that so i think my original impression is right buy a set of sony m4s and use transparency mode okay now it's not going to be as transparent as these these will be perfect for if you work at a daycare center now you you need to hear little kids in the background you got a baby you need to monitor every sound these are perfect for people that work in an environment where you're very important to that environment so you you need to hear every sound every voice you cannot get caught slipping at work yeah these are perfect but if you're working from home and you feel like i just want to walk around i want to cook i want to hear my my water boiling i want to hear every sound i'd rather i'd rather use these on transparency mode because at some point i'm going to want to blast my music and then at some point people are going to get too loud i might be on my lunch break say you bought these away at work right now you rocking these at work all day with ambient sound mode supreme ambient sound mode now you're going to the break room for lunch now you want to rock your music loud you want to tune everybody out you can't do that with these there's no tuning out the outside world at all okay you're in the outside world so on your lunch break you're going to be hearing people people chewing their food crazy you're going to be hearing all that oh i don't know i don't know so let me do a little um let me do a little chest phone call because i got a feeling that these might be perfect for talking on the phone too all right so let me test that feature out all right so i'm going to call my favorite sound quality tester all right amaya that's the person i talked to on the phone the most and she's going to give it to me straight all right so i'm calling amaya let's get max volume hi girlie what's up what are you doing okay first of all let me start by saying congratulations yo y'all that i got that i got the triple crown now i'm very proud of you oh yeah i got you for the ring of course come on bro come on don't even come at me like that all right okay all right now look i'm i got some new earbuds i'm doing a sound test how do i sound ah no these are not earpods these are not earbuds what made you think they was earpods um interesting crystal clearness i like that okay i got to do a quick test now these are some weird earbuds you you when you see this video you're going to laugh all right let me do the fan test first what about now you can still hear me okay okay what about now it sounds sounds the same okay cool all right so these past the fan tests now i got to do one more thing i'm playing some music all right let me turn it down a little bit all right we're talking [Music] do you hear this music in the background is it dumb loud or just right [Music] okay yeah i hear your voice crystal clear too okay the corn card is pretty dumb though right you're not gonna like these though you're not gonna like to trust me [Applause] all right let me turn this up all right so um all right so other than everything as i do sounds clear no cutouts okay perfect perfect all right so let me get back to shooting this video i'm gonna um call you when i finish i got one more test also i got to do bye how'd you fall for that again well i gotta get the last hang up okay now just as i suspected the call quality is amazing okay it's truly amazing i heard her perfectly fine and i don't like to tell amaya what i'm doing in advance because um this way if i say i'm doing some android stuff she automatically got a negative a negative tone she automatically thought these was earpods or some type of new apple product because like i said we talk on the phone all day every day and i usually use my earpods and then she knows when i switch to other earpods she'll be like dad do me a favor put your earpods on because you keep cutting in and out these sound dope now look i'm going to tell you the truth about these earbuds right now let me give you all my my my final impressions as far as the fit super comfortable now they say you can wear these all day i would agree with that okay i would agree with that the reason that not only because of the way they fit in your ears but because when you got these on you're gonna forget you could i could i could see myself forgetting that i have these on because you just hear everything so at first you're gonna feel that little bit of extra weight in your ears but then after a while you're not gonna even notice that you got these in your ears i like that as far as the tap the face that does work too i was testing that playing them playing around with that a couple of seconds ago it does work i mean that's kind of gimmicky but i mean it works it is what it is you know but the biggest thing about these is the sound quality for the music okay the sound quality for the music is just pure trash now i know i'm gonna get some heat in the comment section from people that got these and you know people that really be jock and sony like that y'all know me man it's not about the brand i only pledge allegiance to the hotness y'all know how i feel about the sound quality of these sony ones but these ain't it ids are not it yeah i know i like loud music i like bass cool and and again i completely understand what this product is for it's not supposed to be the loudest earbuds it's not supposed to have extra bass and all of that but if you're paying 178 bucks basically you got to know this if you're buying these for 178 bucks you're buying these for talking on the phone you're buying these because they're super comfortable and you're buying these because you want to hear low music while you're at work and you want to hear everything around you you want the supreme ambient sound mode buy these you want crystal clear phone calls buy these you want earbuds that are so comfortable you're gonna forget you wearing them buy these i'll say one more thing again you want the supreme you want galactus level ambient sound mode buy these but if you're looking for sound quality if you have these already or any other earbuds and you think that these are going to sound like these do not buy these thinking you buying these again ambient sound mode the best no active noise cancellation this look now here's my when i was but i tried to have an open mind with these but in the back of my mind i was saying to myself well i get the gimmick i get the idea behind these i do work just like everybody else but at some point during the day i'm going to want active noise cancellation i don't care if i go to the bathroom and i want to do some instagram while i'm taking the dump i don't want to hear nobody else taking the dump next to me i want to turn on my ambience i mean my active noise cancellation after work if i got to take the train or the bus i want my active noise cancellation i'm in the dmv i don't want to hear everybody else arguing everybody's complaining there's certain points of the day where you're going to wish you had active noise cancellation now if you've got some money to play with i would say buy them both buy them both rock these at your desk at work while you typing you need to hear all your typing sounds your boss try to sneak up on you he can't catch you lacking with these all right you're going to hear every sound buy these for that but then after work put these in your pocket put these on you got to take a phone call take these out put these on this is a nice complimentary product to these as far as standalone perfect for work perfect for talking on the phone perfect for ambient sound mode but you're not going to like listening to music with these i'm just being honest with y'all the music sounds super low the bass it's it does it can't produce that that deep rich bass that you want because of that open ring design it's not going to give you that bass quality you're not going to like those anyway this was a special request video because i kind of didn't even want these because i already knew that most of the reason that i use ear buds for is active noise cancellation that like that's a huge feature for me i use that all the time i couldn't see wearing these anywhere except for in my bed because they're super comfortable so when i'm having these matter of fact that's what i'm gonna rock these for as soon as a mind calls me i'm just going to put these on lay out in the bed and i can just have full conversations and i can still be watching tv at the same time tune the high ass out i can do all of that these are perfect for tuning people out you can still watch your favorite tv show and um talk to your parents on the phone talk to your girl talk to your kids and pretend you're really into their conversation but you could be into your tv perfect for that 180 bucks for these nah these should have been i would say if these was 100 bucks i would have said yeah pick these up because this would be the perfect extra set of earbuds to have with any other year any one of your other you know quality anc earbuds this would have been a nice companion but 180 bucks on these i can't stamp these down with the floor seal of approval unless you're buying them from work or buying them for talking on the phone nevertheless sony link buds on a scale of one to ten i'd give these a major go strictly for talking on the phone and strictly for that supreme level of uh ambient sound mode but um as far as music i'm calling these trash for music anyway hit me up in the

Pixel Buds Pro, [Music] so the pixel buds a series the cheapest ones right now cost 69 nice but the old retired 2020 pixel buds before they stopped being sold were 179 dollars and i really like them i reviewed them i thought they were nice but they did lack active noise cancellation and so they sort of fell a tiny step behind the most premium best wireless earbuds that were out and so i mentioned this at the end of my review this is exactly what i said maybe later they'll do a some next-gen or a more premium pixel buds pro and they'll be 279 and they'll do a noise cancellation and a bigger battery and it turns out well that's exactly what we have here this is pixel buds pro active noise cancellation larger battery except they're only 1.99 and actually if you're cool with any color other than coral they're literally already on sale on amazon for less than the price of the last pixel buds so just to get out of the way right off the top these have nailed it from every single turn from the case to the fit to the sound to the features you probably just close this video right now and just pick up these but don't do that because then you'd ruin the watch time on this video and then that's no fun so how about how about i take you along and i'll show you why these are so good so first of all the case that these come in is basically the same as before which is to say underrated like so many wireless headphones have annoyingly thick or larger cases this is a nice compact clean well-made case sure the white might get a little dirty after a while but it's got this super satisfying magnet to open and close it is ipx2 splash resistant as a case and it has a usbc port at the bottom but also has wireless charging so you can pop it on any qi wireless charger you already have or on the back your phone if it supports power sharing and that's all in a package that fits in the coin pocket in my jeans an all-around absolute win in the case but it's what's inside the case that we're here for and the pixel buds pro have this new shape to them they're mostly a matte black plastic and they have a sort of colored cap at the end that's either fog colored which is what i have it's kind of a light blue or coral a yellowish green or black so just like any other wireless earbuds you pop them out of the case you give them a quarter twist to lock them into your ears and while they don't stick out of my ears too bad like maybe the sony wf-1000xm4s it isn't the lowest profile i've ever seen either it's somewhere in between just a little bit bigger than the last pixel buds but the main difference for me is these don't have the wing tips anymore the wing tips have their upside in the downside the upside is they would absolutely stay locked in my ear much better i could run around and jump and they wouldn't fall out but the tip of it when it was in my ear for more than about an hour or two would create this pressure point that would get more uncomfortable over time and i didn't really like that too much so these don't have that anymore which means they're not quite as locked in my ear but they are more comfortable of course earbuds are different for everybody and when i switch to the larger earbud tips like they really do still stay in my ear fine for walking around normal everyday activities and things like that but yeah that's worth noting honestly i think this is the right move also the buds themselves are ipx4 rated so if you still want to work out in them they're sweat proof but i just probably won't so once it's paired up and these are in your ears there are a lot of different features in here thanks to the pixel buds app but i'm just going to start with the sound you just listen to music how do they sound and i think these sound really really good now i'll spare you the bunch of descriptors and audio file terms that i could use just to tell you basically i really like the sound from these new 11 millimeter drivers once you get a nice seal in your ear you can tell they're really crisp and clear they aren't too shrill or tinny they don't distort very much and the noise cancellation does a great job of getting rid of white noise and there's basically no perceivable bluetooth lag at all when watching videos or gaming there's just two slightly odd things that i noticed one these just have a much stronger bass than the last pixel buds i kind of noted that as a weakness in the previous pixel buds review like they were a little bit weak on the bass not these the bass on these is so much stronger and punchier and just a more full low end that it's a real character highlight like so hip hop music anything with a lot of that lower end frequency sounds really good but in like podcasts or other genres or just things where i don't need all that bass i was looking for an eq to even that out but the pixel buds app doesn't have eq and the pixel phone also doesn't have an eq i actually got a buds firmware update while i was testing these and i thought it was about to add an eq in the sound settings but all it added was this volume eq setting which basically just makes things a little punchier at lower volumes so if you do specifically want to adjust the sound signature of these maybe your phone has eq settings built in some of them do maybe the app you're using for audio has eq settings built in some of them do but yeah pixel buds themselves don't have eq built in yet and neither does a pixel phone but google has thankfully said that there is a full five band eq coming later this year hopefully soon but then the second thing i noticed is these also have a slightly lower overall volume than any other buds i've tested in a while it's not problematically low but i did find myself almost always listening either right below max volume or like two to three notches below the max volume because that was the comfortable listening level usually max volume is way too loud for more than a few seconds of listening on most earbuds but not here it feels like it feels like the bottom 40 of the volume slider is basically useless i can barely hear anything that's that low but yeah i am definitely impressed by how little distortion there is and how clear and thumpy and great it sounds at or near max volume so that's worth noting every pair of noise-cancelling earbuds shall have a transparency mode at least seems like they all should it's like an unwritten rule of these things yeah these are transparency mode built into the pixel buds pro and it's okay it's gonna let in sound from the microphones and pump in your ambient noise so you can hear what's around you but it's not the best i guess airpods are still in a league of their own when it comes to this but i'd rate these transparency mode like a b minus basically it's better than leaving them off but it certainly still sounds muffled and i'm hoping i'm hoping stuff like this gets better in the future i hope they can push firmware updates to also improve transparency mode but the pixel buds real advantage to me is still definitely the software and all the features that are built in i still love having google assistant like a hold away or a tap away anytime i want to ask a question i literally just hold it down and say how tall is the taj mahal it's like a superpower i can just just start opening light shades and turning on smart lamps and things and just yeah assistant everywhere is great and in the pixel buds app in the settings you can customize what a tap and hold on each side does so right now i have the right side hold to trigger the assistant but the left side hole toggles between noise cancellation and transparency mode pretty much every pair of earbuds nowadays also has some sort of touch controls on the outside for your media these are no different it's touch wants to play touch two times to skip forward three times to go back the one thing i couldn't quite get to work as smoothly as i'd like is swiping to change volume these they're just not a big enough surface for me to like reliably get a good swipe in i kept trying to do it but this was like the most inconsistent thing for me basically i just end up like wobbling it around in my ear it works sometimes but again it's not a big surface so what i ended up doing is i just end up reaching in my pocket and blindly like changing the volume on the volume rocker on the phone in my pocket which turned out to actually be totally fine as long as my phone was on me so and there's a bunch of other features too multi-device support so these buds are paired to both my phone and my laptop at the same time and seamlessly switch back and forth as advertised no problem i love that and then they have a find my device feature in case they get lost they have in-ear detection to automatically play and pause when you take them out and put them back in and they even have this ear tip seal check feature which analyzes how well the microphones are actually canceling out sound for you and if it's not working so well it can recommend a different size ear tip to improve the seal it's smart the only thing missing might be the like adaptive sound feature which listens to your environment and then automatically bumps up the volume when your environment gets louder i didn't really use that very much but i noticed it wasn't here so that isn't in the pixel buds pro but it's also apparently coming other than that it's not really missing anything like these have every feature that i'm used to having with earbuds and the cherry on top as they did also with this slightly larger body improve battery life so you're going to get seven hours of actual listening with active noise cancellation on which is far longer than i would ever listen to earbuds that's up to you if you want to do that 11 hours with anc off that's a huge advantage so for 199 should you just get these probably yeah i mean this is easy to recommend there are some other options out there so for around this price you're looking at you could definitely get air pods if you're into that but you can also look towards if you specifically want better sound there are better sounding earbuds but also something like samsung's new buds 2 or pro they're 229. i haven't gotten the chance to hear them yet because they just came out and samsung didn't send me any but i imagine considering how good the previous ones were that those might also be really good and then also as far as like working out in headphones or fit in the ear i still prefer a wing tip in the ear for like actual workout stuff so like beats fit pro beats studio buds those types of things stay in my ear better so worth considering that stuff but as far as like everyday buds you put them in your ear every day you take meetings on them phone calls you walk around with them you just have them on all the time google assistants your super power yeah these are great uh these are the these are the ones i'm gonna put in my backpack and keep around with me everywhere i go well done google thanks for making these please push that eq feature i'm gonna be waiting for it thanks for watching catch you in the next one peace [Music]
Pixel Buds Pro," It’s been 6 Months since I bought the 
Pixel Buds Pro and since their release,   I’ve found I actually like them more. The 
first thing i really like about them is a   feature that was actually missing at launch, 
which is EQ settings. Google did a great job   with the layout of the EQ settings, it gives 
you the full EQ but in a way that explains   what adjustments you make will actually do and 
they have multiple slides for bass and Treble.   Also I find their suggestions of different 
sound profiles at the top to be quite helpful. however, a word of warning, there’s 
a feature called Volume EQ in the   sound settings that I personally have 
found to make the bass sound too muddy   and not tight. The next thing I like about 
these buds is their overall sound. I think   they sound pretty good. They've got pretty 
clear sound with a nice punchy bass. Now,   if you compare the Pixel Buds Pro to something 
like the Sony XM4s or Bose, they sound close,   but the Sony XM4s, which we've reviewed, 
in particular, sound noticeably better. They have a wider soundstage than the 
Pixel Buds Pro and I’d say a bit of   a warmer sound to them as well. Now, I 
know sound can be somewhat subjective,   so if you've listened to the Pixel Buds Pro and or 
the Sony WF-1000XM4s, let me know in the comments,   how do you think these buds sound 
and how do you think they compare? Now, one category where the Pixel Buds Pro 
clearly beats the more expensive set of   earbuds like the Sony XM4s is with their comfort. 
They’re noticeably more comfortable than a lot   of buds that have a more in-ear design. This is 
because the silicone tips of the Pixel Buds sit   just outside of the ear canal to create a light 
seal but they don't go in as far as the XM4s. This does mean, however, for me, their noise 
cancellation, while still pretty excellent,   is not best in class. But considering they 
retail for a hundred US dollars less than   earbuds that I’d considered to have best in class 
noise cancellation, I think the Pixel Buds Pro are   still pretty good. The noise cancellation still 
blocks out most things you don't want to hear. These buds, like a lot of the other buds they're 
competing against, also do not give you that   plugged ear feeling when you wear them and because 
of their noise cancellation, I found they sound   quite a bit better than the less expensive 
buds from Google, the Pixel Buds A Series. Another area where the Pixel Buds 
Pro really stand out is battery   life. TThey’re rated for 11 hours 
of battery life which is a slightly   misleading figure since that’s without 
noise cancellation turned on. The buds   only get 7 hours of battery life with noise 
cancellation, which is still very respectable. I'm not typically used to saying this phrase, 
but Google is absolutely crushing most of the   competition when it comes to the spec. 
When you add in the Pixel Buds Pro case,   you get a total of 20 hours of listening 
time with active noise cancellation on. So, how exactly do Google manage to be most 
of their competition with a battery life spec?  Well, you have to make the year buds weigh 
more for the larger battery and you have to   be able to fit that battery into earbuds in a 
way that's comfortable. Google was able to do   both of these things while not making these 
Buds noticeably more uncomfortable to wear. The Pixel Buds Pro, unlike the Pixel Buds A 
Series, do not feature a stabilizer arc in   their design, which I think actually helps make 
them potentially more comfortable but might not   fit some people’s ears as well. Another thing 
I love about these buds are the music controls   used for them. Unlike most competing buds, not 
only can you control the music by playing and   pausing it with taps or cycling through 
noise cancellation and transparency mode. But Google also brought back volume controls. 
With volume controls on the Pixel Buds Pro, they   do occasionally misfire and instead of swiping 
forward for volume up and falling it back all   accidentally play or pause music. Most of the time 
the volume swipes do work for me. And honestly i'd   rather just take the misfires than not having the 
ability to swipe volume up and down on these buds. So, some other things I've liked about 
these buds over the past six months,   are their multi-point audio controls, the Google 
Assistant works well on the buds themselves,   though I personally wish the response 
time of the assistant was just a bit   faster. One issue I ran into when using 
Nest speakers and displays is sometimes   the Google Assistant on the Nest speakers 
will still hear the requests that I meant   for the buds and they'll do the same thing like 
start playing music which can be a bit annoying. I also like the buds come with a Find My 
Device feature and allows you to ring a bud   to try to help you locate it and the range of 
these buds is also very good as well as their   connection stability. Which I know some people 
had issues with, with previous generations of   the Pixel Buds. With Pixel Buds Pro, I have 
had no issues with their connection. The   mic quality of these buds for phone and work 
calls I thought was also surprisingly good. Here's an example of how they sound compared 
to some other buds I own. Josh: “These are   the Pixel Buds Pro. These are the Pixel 
Buds A-Series. And now, we have these   Sony LinkBuds S. And these are the mics for the 
Sony WF-1000XM4s. And these are the mics for the   Bose Quiet comfort II. And once again, here's 
the Pixel Buds Pro and how their mics sound.” Another thing I love about these buds is 
their case, t feels great in your hands   with this matte white finnish, it’s smooth like 
a river stone, has a satisfying open and close   mechanism that’s fun to fidget with, 
has USB-C for charging as you’d expect,   but unlike the A Series, these buds 
come in a water resistant case that   also brings back wireless charging to 
a set of Pixel Buds. The Pixel Buds Pro   themselves are also water and sweat resistant.
Last few things I like about these buds. First,   they're setup process was 
easy and straightforward. And Google did listen to people's feedback when 
it came to how confusing firmware updates were   for previous versions of the Pixel Buds. All 
right, now let's talk about a few things I   don't like about the Pixel Buds Pro and about 
the only downside I've run into with them over   the past six months is their transparency mode, 
which you can enable by just pressing and holding   the bud and when you listen to your voice like 
'm doing now with transparency mode, it sounds   like i'm a bit underwater, it definitely sounds 
like I'm still wearing buds and it's not nearly   the best transparency mode i've heard, which 
is really weird considering that i thought   the mics on the Pixel Buds Pro were actually 
pretty decent. Another not really downside,   but slight disappointment with these buds is 
the spatial audio feature google announced   along with the buds hasn’t rolled out yet and 
we’re now 6 months into the life of these buds. All in all, I think if Google could just improve 
the sound quality on these buds to be able to   match what Sony is able to do with their XM4s, 
these buds would pretty much be near perfect. The only people I don't think these 
buds are for, is iPhone users. While   these buds will work with any device that 
supports at least bluetooth 4.0 or later,   you have to set them up using an Android device. 
Google does not make their Pixel Buds app   available on iOS like competing buds, because 
of that it really only makes sense to pick up   these buds if you're primarily and Android user. 
The Pixel Buds Pro retail for $199 US dollars,   come in several different colors and I’ve 
left purchase links in the description   so you can check out their current price 
because you can often find them on sale. If you're looking for what to watch next,

Pixel Buds Pro, so the fresh new pixel buds pro or google's first true wireless earbuds since the excellent pixel buds a series which by the way came out over a year ago now seriously time stop being so  scary all right and with the slightly eye water and asking price of 179 great british pounds these fresh pixel buds pro cost 80 quid more than the a series earbuds and for that extra scratch you get active noise cancellation longer battery life wireless charging and a few extra tasty bonuses now i've had these curvy weed buggers lodged in my lug calls for a good few days now so here's my early google pixel buds pro impressions and for more on the latest and greatest tech please do poke subscribe and hitting that notifications bell cheers so let's start with the design beginning with the case and as with the pixel air series it's like a smooth round pebble just slips effortlessly into any pocket or bag if you do slip it into your jeans pocket or something it won't jut awkwardly into your pancreas and make things a little bit awkward the actual pixel buds pro themselves are also like smooth round pebbles and they are pleasingly dinky so they don't jut right out of your head like some of google's previous efforts they are a lot more subtle in that regard it's a matte surface they don't get all smudgy and greasy or anything like that you got a two-tone finish here as well available in four different colors charcoal fog lemongrass and coral there's no kind of ear hooks on the google pixel buds pro to help keep them stable inside of your head so i was a little bit worried that they would be constantly slipping about you'd have to be constantly adjusting them but thankfully even if you're wearing them while walking at peace they stay lodged neatly in place somehow i don't know physics because i really love you guys i even indulged in a little bit of light jogging to see how they'd fare there and again stayed perfectly in place they didn't go flying off and straight down the nearest drain you've just got to make sure you've got the right size of silicon tip installed you get three different sizes bundled with the pixel buds pro so that shouldn't be a problem you've got a fit test as part of the pixel buds app in case you're not entirely sure anywhere but yeah fit seems absolutely ideal and just to further prove that wash test and the pixel buds pro are super comfortable to wear all day long as well apparently google has built some sort of sensors into these things which can actually monitor the levels of pressure inside your lug holes just to make sure that everything is as comfy as possible and whatever this crazy magic is it seems to do the job because i wear these things for hours at a time with no kind of discomfort that's probably helped along by the fact that i'm not constantly fidgeting with them because they're slipping or anything so no issues there and these things were also ipx4 water and sweat resistant yum so yeah no problems whatsoever if you do want to do a proper bit of jogging or get yourself down the gym now when you first hook up your pixel buds pro to your device well i certainly had no issues with the pairing on any of my android smartphones that i tried it with i did have some problems with the pixel buds pro app which were then prompted to download just to add some extra features and settings and toggles but that was only for the first 24 hours and then it just seemed to magically work absolutely fine so just some early teeth in there pre-release let's just add a whole bunch of extra controls which are pretty standard for true wireless earbuds including the ability to customize the controls tweak the anc level just do that ear tip seal check which i told you about before and a bit of find my device action as well if you have to misplace your pixel buds pro anywhere you've also got the ability to connect to two different devices and swap between them on the fly quite handy if you want to get connected to your laptop as well as your smartphone and i've got to save repair true wireless here but the touch controls here are absolutely excellent just a single tap of either birds will pause your music another tap again will resume it you can double tap in order to skip forward triple tap in order to skip back and sometimes those multiple tap efforts can be a little bit wonky sometimes you'll have to do them a couple of times before it actually registers here on the pixel buds port just works perfectly every single time no learning curve or whatever it's perfectly intuitive you can even change the volume on these two wireless earbuds by swiping forward to raise it swiping backwards to lower it of course that's slightly different to most true wireless earbuds where it's up and down it took me a little while to sort of adjust and also swiping down in these buds seems to raise the volume still uh which resulted in earpiece and shrieking and me going you can also long press on a bud to swap between the anc mode and the transparency mode which is basically the opposite of vnc just pumps in everything into your locals you can hear conversations announcements whatever's going on that's the default setup you can also have it cycled between anc on anc off and transparency or just anc on an anc off or whatever you fancy it's all customizable via the app and if you want to have a bit of a chat with the google assistant well no need to poke or plug these buttons you don't have to touch them at all just use the usual voice activation phrase which i won't say right now just in case it sends your smart home gear going a bit mental and speaking of the assistance you can pop up at any time in your ears and alert you to any notifications that have just freshly appeared on your smartphone as long as it's hibernating of course this can mean constant interruptions when you are enjoying a podcast or an audio book or something while you're out and about or just doing a bit of work but no worries if that sounds bloody awful to you you'd rather just be left completely alone because you can knock it off in the pixel buds pro settings you can also highly customize it so you can have it turned on for certain apps turned off for other apps or only your high priority stuff will be alerted now one of the big upgrades for the google pixel buds pro versus the older ear series is the active noise cancellation that's now built in apparently controlled by a custom google processor la di da it's not adaptive vnc or anything like that it can't boost up and then lower back down depending on what's going on in your environment and it's not one of the best noise cancellation efforts i've tested out in a pair of true wireless earbuds either certainly around this sort of price point a lot of stuff still leaks in just in a dampened state so not quite as ideal as some big rivals from the likes of boars if you are a regular traveler for instance but that said the google pixel buzz pro do do just enough so you can walk down really busy noisy high street and comfortably listen to an audio book or a podcast without having to jack the volume all the way up and thankfully no wind interference either hibbet bizarre so let's have a shift onto the sound quality and the google pixel buds pro do pump some pretty respectable sound and audio into your head unfortunately the codec support is rather limited i was basically on esc the whole time but these things i think they also support spc so there's certainly no ldac action there's no aptx hd any of that good stuff it's a bit of a shame considering the price these buds they ain't exactly cheap i also found that the base output was a little bit soft for my personal taste and it's supposed to get a bit more powerful a bit more beefy as you lower the volume but i gotta say i didn't personally notice any difference that said i did enjoy listening to music here on the pixel buds pro as well as audio books and podcasts the whole range comes through nice and clear no discernable issues and the vocals are really strong as well which again is great news if you are a podcast fan for instance and if you actually want to take a call on these things as well if you indeed actually ever take calls well the good news is that the beamforming mics do a great job of picking up your voice and drowning out a lot of the crap that's going on around you if you are making a call while you're walking down again a busy high street so here's a recording of me just chatting using the google pixel bud microphones and i'm in a fairly quiet studio environment right now so nice and easy for them but let's do the high street test by turning on some really loud obnoxious traffic sounds and those on the go right now right next to my head super super loud so a very busy nice people like a dual carriageway or something actually and as you can hear the mic is still doing a pretty good job of picking up on my voice and last up for this google pixel buds pro review the battery life and google advertises seven hours of use on a single charge before the buds will be completely depleted i finally got just under that advertised amount more like sort of six and a half hours and that is with the active noise cancellation turned on if you knock that off entirely you can add a few extra hours on top of that seven hour torso which is bloody brilliant well above average for a pair of true wireless earbuds even in 2022 and perfect for long journeys except for you know transatlantic extravaganzas as for the case well this doesn't pack the biggest battery in the world it can fully recharge the pixel buds pro close to two times and then the case itself will need a recharge as well but the good news is you've got type c charging down below and also wireless charging which you can you kind of expect at this sort of premium price point i cannot mention again just how much i love this case nice and dinky just feels great in the hand in the pocket and i also love the way it flips open like a lighter like it just it really makes me want to spark up a ciggy and i don't even smoke oh and the case itself is ipx2 water resistant as well so not quite as water resistant as the buds but it can still get a bit moist and that right there in a nutshell is the google pixel buds pro and my thoughts on them just have to use them for a few days as my full-time true wireless earbuds i do really like them even though the anc isn't quite as strong as a lot of rivals the customization's great touch control is fantastic got that dedicated google assistant support brilliant battery life comfortable design yada yada so yeah definitely if you've got the scratch for them and you've got an android smartphone and you love a bit of google you want to give them even more cash i love you google here's all my money then 100 i would say go for it definitely if you've got a bit less money to spend you're not quite so bothered about having the likes of the anc and the battery life isn't so important for you but you got the pixel buds a series which are a lot cheaper instead so what do you guys reckon are you tempted have you actually got some pixel buds poor because they are until right now as i say 179 pounds be gritty your thoughts down in the comments below please do pub subscribe doing that notifications bell have yourselves a bloody wonderful rest of the week and that's about it cheers guys love you [Music] [Music] you
Pixel Buds Pro, gets better those devices keep getting better too for instance this week we're rolling out our biggest update ever to pixel buds Pro with a number of AI enabled features and improvements we're improving our clear calling technology which automatically reduces background noise and enhances the voices on any phone call you receive it doesn't matter if the person is calling you from a busy sidewalk or in a noisy restaurant you'll hear them even more clearly and it works on every call no need to press a button and turn it on each time pixelbuds Pro are also among the first earbuds to use Bluetooth super wide band speech it doubles the bandwidth to make voices sound more natural and when it's combined with clear calling your phone calls sound so much better just listen to the before and after grabbing a coffee next to the office and I got a few more meetings to get through in a quick errand and then I'm going to be ready to come out and join everybody for dinner so are you still thinking of trying that place on 63rd I've heard really great things about it you can really you can really hear the difference now ai can make pixelbuds Pro more convenient to use as well when you're listening to music and need to have a quick chat with a coworker or tell the Barista your coffee order you can just start talking pixelbuds Pro will automatically pause your audio and turn on transparency mode no more scrambling to pull the phone out of your pocket or take out a earbud now we're also reducing latency by up to 50% which is great news for the gamers out there and there are a few more updates today that you can read about over on the Google store pixelbuds Pro aren't the only devices getting a boost today with our new feature
Pixel Buds Pro, it all started with the original google pixel buds in their weirdly fitting string design that didn't impress much or sell well google followed it up with the pixel buds too which had a far better fitting truly wireless design and some great touch and swipe gestures to interact with it unfortunately many users reported experiencing connectivity and sound dropouts on their pixel buds too resulting in google quietly discontinuing them well as the saying goes third time's a charm right finally google would replace them with a true successor and true competitor to the airpods pro but for android users finally right no we get the pixel buds a series which had the design and fit of the pixel buds too but with all those great swipe features removed from it and no wireless charging well that's not as exciting as what we're all hoping for but at least it came at a lower price of 100 bucks and they actually sounded kind of decent well unfortunately google has fallen far behind what apple has been doing with their multiple versions of airpods and especially the airpods pro until now these are the google pixel buds pro google's latest truly wireless earbuds to compete with apple's airpod pro with features worthy of the pro name wireless charging multi-device support transparency mode active noise cancellation and swipe gestures from the google pixel buds too and of course even better sound than the pixel buds a series right i mean surely they sound better right well it's complicated well good thing that this is an experiential review and comparison of the google pixel buds pro with the pixel buds acers so maybe it's best for you to hear it for yourself make sure to wear headphones or earbuds in both ears to fully experience this video and by the end you should be able to find out which one you should get or if it's worth upgrading to the pixel buds pro from the a series based upon your preference of course if you want to purchase either of these there are links down below in the description to do so and they help support the channel now if you're confused about what makes this video experiential let's find out with this first song where you can hear the comparative differences between each earbud this track is filled with a lot listen for the sub frequencies the high end from the snare and the hi-hat sounds in the mid-range from the sin [Music] so [Music] so now one of the greatest benefits of audio products becoming more high-tech is the ability to make adjustments to retune or adjust their sound over time based on user feedback or a desire to refine the sound sought out by the engineer it's quite similar to how i'll create updated versions of the custom eq's are great for various headphones and earbuds for channel members sometimes i just want to refine it or provide different options with the google pixel buds pro this experience has been interesting and complicated for you and reviewers you see when i initially listened to the google pixel buds pro i actually thought mine were defective i thought surely there's no way the high end sounds this bad why does it sound like a really bad mp3 at the time i just got off a plane so i thought maybe my ears were a bit messed up from the pressure but when i tried out other earbuds and even asked other trusted ears like l heifer reviews the answer is clear the high end sounded awful these were so bad that my custom eq looked insane with the highest frequency slider nearly pumped to max i wondered how any review could say that they sounded good because they seriously sounded defective and despite my opinion that one shouldn't judge the sound of something purely off of a frequency chart the frequency chart referred that something was way off thankfully they do handle eq alright but there's no way i could suggest these for those who care about sound quality unless they use my custom eq or know how to eq themselves to be frank i was really disappointed but something changed with the 2.14 update google changed the tuning of it which actually brought back some of that missing high end this certainly makes a way that you receive reviews from others and even this one a bit more complicated i have no idea if they'll change the sound in the future and if it makes this video outdated so being the curious type i wanted to capture the differences between each firmware version so i bought another pair of google pixelbuds pro with my own money with this one using the old firmware now admittedly it may be a little bit hard to hear the change in the high end or the air of the song depending on what you're listening on but try to listen to the high end where the air the vocals or reverb linger along with the high end from the hi-hat on this song [Music] when are you [Music] did you hear the difference in the high end between them to make it even easier here is a live frequency graph to show you the difference pretty crazy right for the rest of this video we'll use the updated firmware when we compare it with the pixelbuds a series i'll give you more of my thoughts on the sound later on in the video for now i want to present the audio samples to you to form your own opinions before i share mine with you the google pixel buds pro continue their great design language with a clean soft design that i've come to really love the case continues the egg design they compare more to a soothing stone because of how calming and soft it is to hold and rub your fingers across the pro case is a little bit more rotund compared to the a series case but is still easily pocketable it does only come in a white color and it is a bit easy to get a bit dirty so there are some cases from nomad i like to use to add some extra color and protection the buds pro come in four different colors fog lemongrass and i have both the charcoal and coral here they have the same clean disc design of previous versions but the pros gain a little bit more of an advanced look with the added ports on the other side the actual design between the buds do differ quite a bit while each person's ear is different the a series has a more assured feel in the ear with its little wingtip and narrow stem that goes deep into your canal uh you think that sounds awkward get ready for more um uh tip talk the pros on the other hand are quite bulbous in comparison and rely nearly all on the ear tip to hold it in your ear this is similar to the way that the airpods pro work which ends up feeling quite comfortable and at times like there's nothing in your ear and that's normally a great thing unfortunately for my ears in particular whenever i was working out or a mist of water got into my ear and encountered the ipx4 water resistance i could feel the pros slowly slipping out and became an area of concern for me that they just fall out and i'd lose them i did get some comply foam ear tips that do an excellent job of keeping the earbuds in place and added some extra passive noise cancellation but just a heads up though you can really feel these in your ears as it fills up the space and i know some people will find that uncomfortable as for being able to sleep with them in your ears i personally haven't found any ear but that is as comfortable as the pixel buds a for that the pixel buds pro do manage to do better than most and you could manage to fall asleep with them in your ear if you were tired enough but i do still feel a little bit of pressure on my ear when i lay down with them in so yeah you could sleep with them in your ear but i wouldn't prefer to use them while sleeping for this song pay attention to the clarity of the attack on the acoustic guitar strings and how forward the mid-range is on the body of the guitar and vocals the nights get cold sometimes when i look over i see you by a fire with your hands out in the open and i wonder if [Music] i must be singing on my own the pixel buds a series have the typical tap touch interactions for interacting with it to play pause move between tracks and activate the assistant the pros gain the swipe gestures i miss so much from the pixel buds too so they gain a very easy and intuitive way of being able to increase and decrease the volume with a swipe surprisingly not a ton of earbuds offer the ability to change the volume while retaining other features like skipping tracks or activating the assistant so this is very nice to have and i think they work quite well as for connectivity both of them have android quick pair which is nice to have and because of their link with your google account it does make it very easy to pair with other google or android devices just by tapping on the toast notification on your other device this comes in particularly handy for the pros with multipoint as long as you've previously connected to both devices before you can play audio in one device pause it and then start playing audio on the other device seamlessly and for those out there like me that like to use one earbud at a time either to extend battery life or give you less of a congested feeling you can indeed use them one at a time however one thing that i've noticed a number of times when i do end up putting in the second earbud after using one at a time for a bit is that the two earbuds will be slightly off sync giving a bit of that coarse effect as if it's off by milliseconds not great but you can always alleviate that by putting them both in the case and then reconnecting them there's also a button on the back of the case to manually put it into pairing mode in case you need to this is a much better option compared to others and yes that means you can easily connect it to your computer or even an iphone however there is an app for both earbuds but it's only available on android and it may never expand beyond that so that's worth considering both of them have a neat feature called volume eq which follows a fletcher munson curve or equal loudness curves which has to deal with how human ears perceive low and high frequencies at lower volumes compared to higher volumes i talked about a bit in my video about how to eq headphones and earbuds which you can check out in the card up here but essentially it compensates for this unique thing with our ears that makes them sound consistent in sound whether it's at lower or higher volumes they do differ in areas like adaptive sound which adjusts the volumes up and down depending on external sounds and the pixel buds a series also give you the option to adjust the amount of bass you want for this entire video i have it set to plus one which kind of fills it up a little bit more while still being tasteful now for this track it is a very mid-rangey warm and soulful track listen to her vocals electric guitar lines and the keyboard [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] now let's see how the microphones perform in various environments what you sound like on a zoom call on default settings and how it sounds to receive a phone call while doing that and to help financially support videos like these and to provide the value that you're looking for while saving you time i'll test out the mics while telling you about this video's sponsor nordvpn i don't know if you feel the same way i do but it seems like many things that internet are changing a lot and the need for

that's pretty loud here's what the pixel buds a series sound like in a simulated crowd environment couldn't find a rowdy enough group so we have to simulate here's what the pixel buds pro sound like in a simulated crowd environment here's what an hd phone call would sound like on the google pixel buds a series how do you think it sounds and here is what an hd phone call sounds like on the google pixel buds pro how do you think it sounds here's what the pixel buds a series sound like next to a busy road here's what the pixel buds pro sound like next to a busy road and here's what the pixel buds a series sound like next to a water phone here's what the pixel buds pro sound like next to a water fountain here's what the pixel buds a series sound like if you're getting a car wash and here's what the pixel but pro set like if you're getting a car wash i'm totally not doing this for taxes just kidding i'm totally doing this for taxes this next track is filled with a wide spectrum of frequencies and can really make the mid-range and high-end differences come out quite a bit [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] unfortunately neither of these are great for gaming on pc or mobile and do not offer a low latency mode so you'll experience a bit of a delay in audio i wouldn't suggest them if that is something you care about and honestly no bluetooth option i've tested out even gaming earbuds are sufficient for fps games or other reaction critical games so it's best to find a wired option or headset with a wireless receiver on a pc compared to the five hours you can get on the pixel buds a series the pixel buttons pro coming in an insane 11 hours on one charge and a total of 31 hours when recharging with the case but with ansi off when you turn anc on it's still a phenomenal 7 hours on the earbuds alone and 20 hours when you include the charging case in my practical experience i've accidentally fallen asleep with the pros in my ears and woke up the next morning with it still playing audio with battery to spare so i think they're quite stellar this track is quite revealing on how the mid range is handled between each earbud as well as how it handles some of the higher end for things like symbols and the snare pay attention to see if you hear one of them being a bit harsher than the other [Music] uh [Music] hey [Music] [Applause] google's approach to anc is actually really quite nice in my experience i find that they managed to cancel more the body of a human voice and a white noise from things like fans a bit better than apple airpods pro what you do still hear in a person's voice is more around the cliche honky telephone sounding ranger frequencies but at a reduced level this is in comparison to the airpods pro that have more of an even and natural sound that still comes through but lowers the overall volume across the entire frequency spectrum i do think this does come down to preference on what you prefer and will have a bit more of an in-depth comparison of anc performance where you can actually experience what it's like to wear them and we'll compare it with the galaxy butts 2 pro and the apple airpods pro as well that's one of my insane in-depth reviews and comparisons if it's out by the time you're watching this it'll be up in the card up here or link in the description one area that the pixel buds pro excel in is the reduction of that plugged ear cabin pressure that you typically experience in your ears when you have anc on this is something that my ears are extremely sensitive to in the pixel buds pro they have sensors and ports built into the earbuds that can detect the pressure and reduce it so that you don't feel as much pressure and it really does work i can still feel it but i have to really pay attention to it compared to other earbuds where it's really obvious one thing to note i do notice that the comply ear tips will actually reduce the performance of the anc a little bit which is actually a bit of a surprise as foam ear tips usually have the assumption that they'd block out more sound and that is indeed the case passively but not in the case here where it's matched with google's anc tuning also another little quirk i've noticed that if you put your finger on the ear tip or you don't put it in your ear just right you actually will hear a little bit of a feedback on your earbud that sounds like this kind of quirky and weird i haven't experienced this on any other ear butter headphone alright for this song listen to the low end in the high end from the snare and especially the hi-hat to hear how bright or sharp the high end is [Music] i cannot be going home [Music] one area that isn't so great on the google pixel buds pro is transparency mode it's actually not that bad in terms of how things sound around you but not as good and clear as airpods pro which keeps that high-end air that makes it sound really natural no the issues i particularly run into comes from wind noise and sudden sound when you walk around fast enough have a guess of wind hit you or have a fan blow out your ears you'll hear it blowing up against a microphone like this just walking through this room at a normal pace will be enough for me to hear the wishes of air in my ears just imagine how bad it is while running now to be fair there are many other earbuds that also struggle with this in transparency mode the other issue i have comes from sudden loud sounds i particularly noticed this when working out when i set down my weights the sudden clink is amplified in what feels like is even louder than real life and at a frequency that is especially painful in my ears and to be clear i'm not dropping my weights i'm not even setting down my weights hard so i really make sure to not use transparency mode while working out this is less than ideal for those who work out in a public gym now if someone from google is watching this i imagine they have their limiter tuned to have a very slow attack so the sudden clink of weights is let through at an amplified volume before it has time to process and reduce the volume so it doesn't blow out my ears hopefully this is something that they can address in a future update all right this next track is from my personal friend hannah apparent listen to how dynamic the trek sounds and if you can hear all the layers from the horns and the varus strings and melody percussion instruments and make sure you go follow her at himparrot.com [Music] as an audio engineer i typically avoid talking about how loud a pair of headphones or earbuds can get because most people want to crank things up as loud as possible and end up causing permanent hearing loss as someone that is a strong advocate for protecting the only pair of ears that you have i don't like talking about which one is louder for the google pixel buds pro i'll make an exception because i often find myself thinking that they're too quiet for some pieces of content despite having them turn up to max and specifically on google pixel devices if you're listening to something that is quieter like a part of a tv show or movie a youtube video or a podcast that's particularly quite compared to most you don't have the added headroom for increasing the volume to make it a bit more normal and loud now it's quite interesting because i normally have my earbuds six to eight clicks down from the top depending on the earbud but for these i have them almost always on max for anything that's not music and with that said i'll say that most music should be more than loud enough if they're mixed to typical standards and this may not be as much of an issue if you're using these on another device other than a google pixel my samsung galaxy s2 ultra was louder by notable amount in my tests hey so i forgot to film this initially but another really interesting thing about turning the volume all the way to max on the google pixel buds pro is that it compresses it it'll actually have like a pumping kind of sound when you turn it all the way up [Music] so you actually get a poorer experience or the music sounds worse at max volume so you know it's not really worth it save your ears alright for this song it has a killer bass line on it pay attention that the synth and the vocal reverb [Music] forever [Music] prior to the update i honestly couldn't suggest the google pixel buds pro to anyone that strongly weighs sound quality for their buying decisions since the update though i really haven't changed my mind but there are some caveats do i think they're one of the top choices for sound quality definitely not the first generation of galaxy butts pro and the new galaxy buds 2 pro are significantly better in sound quality the pixel buds pro have a bit too much bass boost that seems to really muddy up the sound a bit and there's a weird spike in the highs where the attack of a snare drum tends to be on heavier rock or metal type songs that can be particularly painful at louder volumes and it pokes out a bit higher than the rest of the frequencies interestingly enough this happens to also be the painful frequency range produced when i set my weights down that i mentioned earlier when i talk about the transparency mode and unfortunately the mid-range also has a kind of papery sound to it that makes it sound really cheap at its default tuning i find that the sound is quite a few steps back compared to the pixel buds a series when you can adjust the bass up on the a series to fill it up a bit more it makes it closer to what the pixel buds pro are trying to do but it manages to have a cleaner and airier high end without an overly congested low end and that is as long as you set the base boost at a moderate level you might go with plus one and plus two at max in terms of what would be less painful to listen to the a series are a much better option now i really want to emphasize that earbuds come down to your personal preference and the wing that you give to various things like sound features and the quality of those features and whatever else that comes into play but if audio is one of your main qualifiers it may be comforting to know that you are able to just eq on the pixel buds pro somewhat with something like wavelet this would allow you to balance out the frequencies around those spikes in the high end so they don't stick out so unevenly while cleaning up the low end and when i do this i actually like the sound quite a bit more than a series the issue is that this process isn't exactly the easiest thing for the average person to explore and wavelet is not without its quirks and limitations again i do have a beginner's guide to eq'ing that you can watch but if you prefer not doing that on your own or wanted tuning based upon my own preferences i have spent a few days putting together a custom eq for channel members if you want to use it all you have to do is hit that little button next to the subscribe button and it does help support the channel and the purchase of earbuds headphones and equipment for videos like this like this extra pair of google pixel butts pro to show the difference between firmware versions how about we listen to how my custom eq sounds compared to the stock tuning this song has a lot of great reverb going so kind of emphasize a bit that vocal forwardness and the airiness let me know what you notice and let me know what you think of the sound in the comments [Music] i need a west coast [Music] that's like [Music] at a price of 199 the pixel buds pro are twice the price of the a series and like most things it is not twice as good but it does come down to your wants or preferences i never want to force my preferences on you but here are some things to consider as you figure out what is the best route for you if you're the type of the person that honestly doesn't care about active noise cancellation transparency mode multi-device support or swipe gestures i'd honestly suggest buying or keeping the pixel buds a series not only are they more comfortable and secure at least for my ears they're also quite a bit cheaper if sound quality is the most important thing for you and you're not the type that knows how to or feels comfortable adjusting the eq on your earbuds then again the pixel buds a series make the most sense now it is possible that google will continue to refine the audio over future firmware updates or maybe the eq feature that soon account will be more than sufficient for adjusting the sound quality but it's really hard for me to suggest something on possibilities in the future so i guess that comes down to your own comfort level also if you are the person that is comfortable adjusting things in wavelet or wants to use my custom eq then the pixel buzz pro can make some sense if you do care about active noise cancellation a lot and want to be in the google ecosystem i think the google pixel buds pro actually do a pretty good job here like i mentioned before its weak spot is how fast it compresses or limits audio and transparency mode so hopefully that can be fixed in a future firmware update and to be fair that's only an issue in one setting mode the area that the pixelbots pros shine the most is the swipe gestures and the battery life if either of those are the main part of your buying decision then the pixel butts pro make a lot of sense now here's another great song that covers a ton of the frequency range let's compare both earbuds and my custom eq [Music] mistake [Music] is [Music] now for those who really want to know my personal preference if i had to choose between the two i would actually pick the google pixel buds pro and that's because i have the ability to adjust the eq to my taste if i couldn't do that i definitely wouldn't use the google pixel buds pro they have to listen to and they have a sound that really bums me out i was hoping for something far better than this especially when their nest speaker was tuned surprisingly well now if i had a choice of any earbud these wouldn't even be considered as an option for me to choose from as there are many other options that sound way better than these trust me i really wanted to like these but the sound really bothers me but if they don't bother you and you're the type of person that would like to buy them you can do so by clicking the link in the description or right here let me know your thoughts on the sound test features and which one is for you or not for you full disclosure google did not send these to me they were purchased with my own money and google has no editorial control of this review and they are seeing it at the same time as you thanks for watching this is tech today until next time
Pixel Buds Pro, Google has had a number of near misses with product lineups over the past few years things like lackluster quality control or problematic areas I've always really let things down a little 2022 there was seen an inward look and a closer attention to detail paid to those finer little aspects of devices the pixel 7 Series is a testament to that and somewhat to a greater extent so are the pixel Buzz Pro this after so many months is now our long-term review of Google's Premier wireless earbuds thanks for watching 95 Google here on YouTube remember to Thumbs Up Hit subscribe and then tap the Bell icon to be among the first to watch our upcoming videos so moving away from that thin style shape to a larger bulbous design it's not something that I was actually personally eager to switch out to when I first saw the pixel buds Pro unveiled on stage i o 2022 I've always found that while that fin on the pixelwood's a series and to a lesser extent the 2022 buds can be uncomfortable for long periods it always felt secure and over time the rubberized stocks softened making it easier to bear or almost less noticeable when plugged in your ears Google's decision to stick with the egg like charge case though is one of the things that I do love it's really iconic from afar and I've noticed that the matte finish on my particular pixel Buzz pro carry case hasn't picked up as much Sheen and damage after slipping out on in and out of my pockets over the past few months I will say it seems to be a little bit more durable it has taken a beating day to day and one thing I will know is that the the hinge itself is a little creaky on my unit this doesn't appear to affect the magnetic clasp it keeps it shut though which is still nice and strong but something I am a little bit wary of the longer that I do use the pixel Buzz Pro and I will report back if something changes but it just sounds a little creaky at this point in time I will also say that the move to a matte black finish for the most of the chassis with colorful nodes at the top is one that does feel a little bit of odds or at least at odds with the pixel 7 Series and somewhat more at home with the smaller pixel 6 and the pixel 6A specifically with their own two-tone black frame and colorful designs it's eye-catching I will say that for sure with the color selection spanning bright and colorful to more muted and plain if you do want that fog and the plane black options having used the coral color for the latter part of three months now I think it's actually quite nice and obvious to people that I have earbuds in my ears the bright color being that dead giveaway and something that does indicate to people that I'm walking past or I'm interacting with that I am listening to something I will say that I'm still not fully convinced by the bean shape of the pixel buds Pro I think think that for me often I just have to readjust when I'm wearing these as to get that like secure fit in my ears something I feel like I'm actively fighting to get with the pixel buds Pro is that actual perfect seating and it can be a little bit of annoyance when I was just used to plonking or twisting the previous generation into my ear without a second thought and having that thin fix everything in position fitting frustrations aside though the new design is infinitely more comfortable when sat right in your ears I've worn the pixel buds Pro for upwards of five hours on a lot of sessions over the last three months without any sort of discomfort whatsoever usually I'll go and grab my ancient Bose qc35 II when I know that I'll be wearing headphones or earbuds 3 for longer periods but for the most part the biggest compliment that I can pay the pixel buds Pros that I've been doing that less and less since my review unit arrived at my door one thing I have noticed though is that these silicon earbud tips they sometimes do become a little bit unfurled or can snag when removing them from the ears that go inside out the rubber itself of these silicon buds is thin and soft and it's more comfortable with the added bonus of that extra isolation you can upgrade these or even switch them out with the particular small medium and large size in the box but I'm not sure if there's going to be worthwhile for most people out there I will say that the audio experience with ANC after months of extensively testing is a fairly solid I can actually vouch for the quality here the limitations of in-ear earbuds versus ovary headphones when it comes to noise cancellation are definitely pronounced but at no point at a major frustration with the pixel buds Pro that said the passive isolation that you can achieve by using this ear tip seal function for testing the ENC feature is actually especially useful and one thing that I would say do that straight away and the mobile phone with your mobile phone your pixel whatever happens to be will indicate whether you need to adjust that seal or maybe change the able tip size I think for me the biggest test for the pixel buds Pro and bike extension most earbuds from much I'm using earbuds over the last few years has been going on the London Underground and it's a noisy clattering environment I've used the pixels Pro for several hours multiple times on the Underground carriages and I've been pleasantly pleasantly surprised because there is just enough dulling of background audio chatter all that kind of thing that you can focus on what you're listening to without being truly deafened by that homo rattle of a train Carriage itself ordinarily I'd avoid podcasts in this general or this specific scenario as there's not enough background audio with spoken word to fill or minimize loud cracks bumps and rumbles but I will say that it's something I'm happy to do every time I do head on to a platform I'm not often whizzing around London though but the pixel buds ANC has passed my own personal Proving Grounds I think with flying colors and I'm sure it will be okay for most people I will say day to day in a quiet office environment like here or in on a Scenic Walk The Experience is pleasant and I find that the whoosh of passing traffic nearby busy road is almost but not completely eliminated in my testing the transparency mode I will save one of the excellent additions here it just lets in just enough sound without completely washing out things like music or spoken word audio that you listen to is something I use when I do things like waiting in line for a coffee or I'm expecting someone to speak to me and it works flawlessly in my experience I also got to give a compliment to the touch controls because most of these on Google products for excellent anyway but they are as good here as they were on previous versions I'm still not completely sold on touch controls for Bluetooth earbuds as it does create an extra volume there but these are the best that I've tried by some margin even soft or slight Taps are recognized and registered which is ideal if you're commuting or moving around a ton like in the gym and you just want to tap you're able to skip track pause or do whatever you need to do while I can't speak for every single person that has used these earbuds though I've found the connection strength and consistency to be Flawless on the pixel buds pro at no point have I experienced cutouts or drop signal which is something that people with the previous versions even the pixel buds a series which fix it to a greater extent have had issues with I'll also note that the new multi-point feature is something that I've thoroughly enjoyed being baked into these particular earbuds too although it's nothing new being able to link my laptop on my phone simultaneously will always be useful for calls especially receiving them on the phone and then switching straight back to listen to title or whatever happens to be on my laptop as you probably know most bluetooth earbuds live and die by their audio quality in the pixel buds Pro are absolutely no different they are far from the best sounding earbuds that you can buy right now that's all I will say I listen almost exclusively via tidal and to podcasts using pocket casts without attempting to list off tracks that you're probably not familiar with I have found that the pixel Buzz Pro handle most genres really well here's a Crux of it though the sound is good enough for most people and I can count myself in that group too as there's a lean towards the bass and bump treble the S sounds can hiss a little in my experience and bass can infringe upon tracks sometimes but overall I've got to say it is a fairly rounded sound for what the earbuds same aim to set out to do a major sore point that I will say is a lack of truly high quality audio codecs on offer AAC and SBC are accounted for but there's no aptx the former is favored by iPhone and iOS but the latter is just better for Android users and a prominent absentee and something I'm a little bit frustrated about as it would have been a little bit nicer to have I do love though that Google has made good on a promise to add an inbuilt equalizer to tune these earbuds on the fly but it's fairly basic all the same you can make some fairly standard adjustments and it's done down with default profiles here too if you do want to adjust those that's great if you're not confident tuning and tweaking there's also on top of that no notable latency when watching things like videos on Netflix on YouTube and I will say even gaming latency when using the pixel 6 and the pixel 7 in the time I've used these seems to be pretty fine although I'm not much of a gamer I haven't extensively tested gaming with more devices but I will say that it seems fine on my pixel phones so far call Quality is one of the areas that I'm not always certain of when using headphones or even earbuds without especially that stem microphone that moves it closer to your mouth the microphone on here sounds fine it's nothing special and I will say it's been okay for the short calls that I've done with them in my experience I wouldn't advise they're using the pixel buds Pro for conference calls unless you have no other option this is one area I'd really like to see Google up the quality for the next iteration and you can hear a sample of what these sound like right now so for those wondering about audio quality with the Google pixel plus microphone well this is a short video shot on the pixel 7 Pro front facer you can obviously get an indication of just what the microphone sounds like hopefully it's nice and clear although then again the microphone itself is quite far away from my mouth so hopefully it's picking up everything that I'm saying nice and clearly but I've noticed that with most phone calls people seem to be happy with it but you would be the judge of that let me know what you think down in the comment section below the major area that have been blown away by the pixel buds Pro even when compared to more premium earbuds is in the improved lifespan I've only managed to run the battery life in the three months I've had these two below that 30 figure on two separate occasions and that is absolutely exceptional someone who's a bit of a moderate to heavy user at least in my book in terms of hours and minutes on regularly scene upwards of six hours per earbud the case adds a few more days of listening for me before I even need to think about putting it on the pixel stand and it's a win-win as you never actually need to worry about if you'll run out of power with regular usage I see that as a couple of hours per day maybe up to a maximum of four hours of listening I think if you fall into that camp this could be among or these could be among the longest lasting bluetooth earbuds that you'll probably ever use at least at this stage of 2022 that's not discounting those of us with headphones or earbuds practically glued in even with ANC active I'm never thinking about the next charge too drastically Google's estimated 11 hours per earbud with ANC deactivated definitely Rings true in my experiences here you'll need to determine whether you want an extensive lifespan though or noise canceling active and transparency mode available to determine just how long you will Garner from these earbuds so to kind of wrap up this long term review I think Google has once again stepped into that premium audio Arena and while there are some undoubted downsides things are better than ever audio quality does remain a little bit of a weak area although it is absolutely fine and if you do want the best audio Fidelity possible then you're probably still going to be looking elsewhere anyway cohesion and lifespan are the two areas where I think the pixel buds Pro truly Excel compared to the competition the ANC isn't class leading but it offers a decent dull of background noises to truly be considered a worthy addition to your device I'm intrigued to see if that upcoming spatial audio function is as good as it's touted to be but annoyingly we're still waiting for that to arrive I know don't think the latest made by Google bluetooth earbuds are the best you can buy and especially at 199 dollars you can get better audio at a much lower price conversely to that though if you have a pixel phone then I think there really are a few better partner accessories than the pixel buds Pro you can use them with a non-google phone but even if features translate it's clear to see that these are really designed to be used with a pixel in mind and that's an added bonus for people out there as on top of that there's the extra extra pixels feature drops that will come later down the line which should bring you extra features and functions that said I don't think you should ever buy a tech product on Promises of future functions and features and the pixel buds Pro absolutely no different I want to hear from you though have you been using the pixel buds Pro since launch or even in the recent weeks how are you getting on and where do you think Google can improve with future releases drop a comment down below it's always interesting to hear your thoughts but as always until next time this is Damien with 95 Google saying thanks for watching and I will speak to you later
Pixel Buds Pro, ever since i bought a pair of airpods pro almost like two years ago i've used them as my main pair of earbuds for like every single phone didn't matter if i was using an android or an iphone the airpods pro were the earbuds that i grabbed every single time until now these are a pair of pixel buds pro and as much as i love my air pods i think they're getting replaced with these they are the real deal the last pair of earbuds that google came out with which is the pixel buds a series were also really really good and if you're looking for a pair of wireless earbuds that are on the cheaper side i still recommend them you should at least consider them but they had a few downsides there was no active noise cancellation or no transparency mode it could only charge via that usbc port because there's no wireless charging built in and while they did sound decent they didn't blow my mind or anything the pixel buds pro change almost all of that if you put the two side by side they don't look all that different especially when they're in their charging case but there's a lot of little details here and there that add up to a much different experience the first noticeable change is the addition of these microphone holes on each earbud those are for the new active noise cancellation features that we're going to talk about later they've also removed the little wings on each earbud which at first i was actually a little worried about because without them i thought the buds would fall out of my ears easier but it turns out that that's not the case they've ever so slightly thickened the pixel buds pro so that it stays more in contact with the inside of your ear and the result is an earbud that's not only more secure but it's also more comfortable i do want to make the disclaimer that everyone's ears are different and what's comfortable in my ear might not be comfortable in yours but i found that the pixel buds pro definitely are more comfortable in my ear and when i shook my head like crazy to try and make the earbuds fall out the a series bud fell out long before the pixel buds pro one did there is one downside to this new design i found that if i was doing some strenuous activity like running on a treadmill the pounding of my feet on the treadmill would shake the earbud just enough so the sound would distort a little bit in my ear they never fell out but they do move around a little in there you know what the best thing about bigger earbuds is though they usually fit bigger batteries in them and that has to be what google did because the pixel buds pro has the best battery life in any pair of wireless earbuds that i've ever tested google is claiming 11 hours with the noise cancellation turned off and then seven hours with the cancellation on and that's only what's stored in the earbuds themselves that doesn't include the 20 hours worth of charge that's stored inside the charging case which is now capable of wireless charging heck yes so let's talk about that active noise cancellation each pixel bud pro has three microphones there's two on the outside and then one on the inside of the ear like most noise canceling earbuds they do fantastically with sounds that are fairly even in pitch you know air conditioners fans airplane cabin noise that stuff people talking not so much but that's fairly par for the course the only thing i was a little disappointed with is the transparency mode on the pixel buds pro with it turned on you're supposed to be able to hear things around you as if you didn't have earbuds in your ears but the sound that's projected through is not great there's still a bit of that earplug sound where everything is just a little bit too muffled you can switch between the two modes by tapping and holding one of the earbuds you can actually rebind that so that one of your earbuds will activate the google assistant and then the other one will change the noise cancellation mode but that's not the exciting part the best part for me is that the pixel buds pro have full volume control gesture support and that's something that's either overlooked or done very poorly on most earbuds you just swipe forward or backwards to change the volume and it works perfectly love that they've got a few extra smart features built into like the fact that your music will automatically pause when you take out one of your earbuds and then resume when you put it back in you can also just use one earbud if you want to leave the other one in its case it'll work just fine all right sound quality the pixel buds pro actually have slightly smaller drivers than the a series from 12 millimeters down to 11. what does that mean for sound honestly haven't got a clue i'm not an audiophile but the pixel buds pro do sound a good bit better than the a series do to my ear there's quite a bit more of that low end present in the pixel buds pro especially in bass heavy edm songs but i also think they've scooped the mids a bit too much meaning the treble and bass are exaggerated and then that mid-range is kind of left behind it's all right for certain genres of music but i think these earbuds would benefit a lot from a better eq which is not available in the software right out of the box they do get loud enough at the top end for me but i think they also distort a little up there so maybe keep the volume a bit lower than maxed out i'm usually pretty happy around the 80 to 85 range i think the worst part about the pixel buds pro is the price and it's not even that bad they sell for 200 us dollars which is still 50 cheaper than the airpods pro and are around the same price as samsung's galaxy butts pro it's a solid twice the price of the pixel buds a series though which are still a great pair of wireless earbuds the biggest thing you have to ask yourself is if the active noise cancellation wireless charging and slight bump to sound quality is worth the extra 100 bucks to you if so the pixel buds pro are awesome if not maybe click on this link right here to watch my video on the pixelbuds a series and decide if you want to go that route instead anyway hope you liked the video thanks for watching and as always have a great day
Soundcore Liberty 3," - Sponsored by Soundcore by Anker, we've got our unboxing
of the Liberty 3 Pros. These have a host of improvements
over the last generation, starting with la couleur. la couleur? Help me out David, how's
my french? How's my- - [David] It's pretty good. - Okay, cool. There's white, purple, silver and black. And obviously I'm going
straight for the purple ones. - [David] Good choice! - Everything from
comfort to sound quality, to even the packaging. Nice. Seems to have been
improved over the last gen. Let's start with what they figure are the top selling points. Their Astria Coaxial
Acoustic Architecture 2.0, which doesn't have any more
elaboration on the box. But basically there's a Knowles
balanced armature driver as well as a 10.6
millimeter dynamic driver in each earphone. There's six microphones. So that's part of their
HearID active noise-canceling, which can apparently
be adjusted in terms of how much ambient noise it blocks. Personally, I think
that's a really good thing because there are times
when I want to block just a little bit of
my kids being too loud. No, seriously. I use my ANC earphones all the
time to not listen to music. You know, but I still want them to be able to talk to me if they're hurt. You know what I mean? Let's go ahead and put
on the small ear tips. There are small, medium,
large and Chungus, man. Yeah. My ear canals are
nowhere near that wide. - [David] Not with that attitude. - I mean, they can be stretched.
They can be stretched. We've also got three different si- oh, four difference included sizes of their kind of active wing tip things here. So let's go ahead and, Wow, this is pretty impressive. These were super easy to put on and are really freaking hard to take off. Wow, that's a really good design. I've never seen this before. I like it. They've got
a little lock in there. Look at this. It's a
little lockie boy in there. Neat right? - [David] Yeah! - Now that we're looking
more closely at this, you can see the insertion
detection mechanism right here. So that'll be able to tell
if it's in your ear or not. There's your charging contact points. So a total of, I believe it's 30 hours, 32 hours of battery life
is held in the case. So that'll give you four charges. And then there's 8 hours
of rated battery life for the earbuds themselves. I like the style of these. That is a really cool
purple in my opinion. One big improvement over last gen is that they are quite a bit smaller and lighter. So they're still not going
to be as small and light as something like an AirPods Pro, but the lighter you can make these things, the better pretty much, cause that's really going
to help them stay in. Now I think I did get the size of my wings and my ear tips right so we can do a quick shake test. You ready for the shake test David? - [David] Yes. Okay, here we go. I've got to brace myself here. Not bad, not bad. I managed to loosen the right side. So I might actually, I might
have asymmetrical ears, might need a slightly bigger
earpiece for this one. It feels like it's not
quite as snug of a fit, but the left one held really, really well. Good noise isolation. I haven't actually experienced
the noise cancellation, so let's go ahead and get
it paired to my phone. One cool thing is that they
support multipoint connectivity. So you can have two devices
connected to them at once. And the case charges either
wirelessly or over USB Type-C. This is a pretty cool case, considerably larger still
than the AirPods Pro case. But boy, are we ever getting closer. Like I think this looks like it might be earphones pocketable. Let's find out. We're ready? - [David] Oh yeah. Easy.
- Yup. Well their previous ones
have been quite a bit bigger. I think Soundcore is moving
in a really good direction in terms of the size of the case. Alright, let's throw
these in pairing mode. I'm assuming that it's
pressing this button is what pairs them, but I don't actually know that for sure. I mean, I guess there's
always instructions. Hey, look at that. There's my USB-C cable. No wall wart included. Although, I get that with earphones. Open the charging case and they will just automatically
go into pairing mode. Oh, alright. Well that's the LED indicator flashlight. Okay, so you can just automatically
put it in pairing mode or you can force it. Not bad, I think the active
noise canceling is working now. Oh, hey! Is this our
restock beanie tube things? - [Nick] Yeah you bet. - Yay! lttstore.com baby. Do we have new colors? - [Nick] You bet. - Nice. Wait. We're not actually
doing a pink one are we? - [Nick] Uh, No. We've got replacements
if people need them. - Sorry, sorry you guys. If you had your heart set
on getting a pink one, that is not going to be a thing. Let's see if I can figure
out how to turn the ANC off. Okay. Hi. - [David] Hello. - Yep. That pass-through
is working confirmed. So I tried to install it
and it basically just said, app not installed, which was self-evident. You won't have this problem because you'll be buying this
product after it's available. We are back. And this time the app has been
updated on the Play Store. Liberty series, boom. Liberty 3 pro. Here we go. Touch range is highlighted
in the blue area. Four gestures. Press, double tap, triple
press and long press. Okay. Here's one of the things
I really wanted to try out. Oh. Vocal mode, fully transparent. So, If you want to hear
like traffic or whatever. So cause you don't want
to get hit by a car. I guess you want fully transparent. And then vocal mode is supposed to only let through voices I guess. How you doing David? - [David] I'm doing fantastic. Did you know the average Blue Whale is actually smaller than 16,000 elephants? - 16? How many elephants? - [David] 16,000 elephants. - 16,000 elephants? - [David] So the average Blue
Whale is smaller than that. - Smaller than that.
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Thank you, that's very helpful. They both sound about
the same with voices, but we don't have a lot
of ambient noise here to sort of compare their
functionality with. Okay. One of the big functions in their software is the HearID test, which will actually test your hearing and then adjust the EQ of
the headphones based on that. So, oh man, look at this. I got to click this
third button here, 30-40. - [David] Should you try
them before doing that and then do it, so you
can hear the difference? Or does that not matter? - Oh, I guess that's not a terrible idea. The ear canal test needs to be
taken in a noisy environment. Wow. That's really interesting. David, can you say something? - [David] I'm speaking, this is me speaking.
- Oh, okay. Yeah. That's working then. They've done a really good job of dialing in the noise cancellation
and transparency modes so that your music sounds
basically the same. But the flip side of that is that while the AirPods Pro do a good job of sounding more like an open back headphone when you're in transparency
mode, these don't. They sound like IEM. So if you like the IEM sound, these are always going to sound like IEMs. Even if pass-through is on. Impressions without LDAC, little hollow sounding, not super rich. It's nice to just have a super easy to use EQ built right into the software. That's more to my liking. Definitely find the highs a little bit, almost too crisp out of the box, but you can turn them down. It's kind of too bad you
can't go in and just say, I mean, hey. Yeah, this may be true to
what the artist intended. Like nice and flat. You know, once we've
compensated for my hearing. But it'd be nice to be able
to go in there and say, okay yeah, that's fine, but I'd like to boost this a little bit. Definitely addresses the lack of fullness that I was hearing with the
default EQ curve though. Would strongly recommend
running the wizard, if you get yourself a pair of these which of course you can do at the link in the video description. Thanks for watching. Thanks to Soundcore by Anker
for sponsoring the video. And we'll see you guys in the next one."
Soundcore Liberty 3, hello everyone i'm diane boehm and today we're going to be looking at a pair of truly wireless noise canceling and excellent sounding earbuds from soundcore big thank you to soundcore for providing these these are the liberty 3 pros and coming in at 169 they have a lot to offer so without further ado let's get right into the unboxing as i always like to say the unboxing experience is a product's first impression and the liberty 3 pros deliver with sleek packaging lifting the magnetic lid reveals everything neatly laid out first we have the charging case and this has a nice feel in the hand and is actually surprisingly thin and has a very satisfying sliding lid mechanism sitting right above the charging case are the liberty 3 pros themselves featuring a cool futuristic design looking at the different use of materials already i can tell that these are well put together in the middle of the box are a wide selection of ear and wingtips to help you find the best fit possible putting them on the earbuds they click firmly into place and don't feel like they would ever fall off we can now rest the earbuds in the charging case and this looks very nice lastly in the box we get a usb a2 usb-c cable it's always good to see usb-c and we also get a quick start guide and warranty information alright so let's take a closer look at the liberty 3 pros now the liberty 3 pros come in four colors and as you can see i have the black versions here and they feature this rounded almost futuristic design that i think looks quite good on the back here we have a glossy plastic surface with the soundcore logo and this surface also acts for your multi-touch controls so you can for example start and stop your music take or make phone calls and even switch between the anc and transparency modes right on the headphones but more on that later here we will also find one of the many microphones now the liberty 3 pros feature six in total and these all serve to help with noise reduction and then looking at the ear tips you can see we have some metallic accents and not only does this look good by adding a touch of color but of course is also very durable in an area that is very important on the back the earbuds feature a sensor that will detect whether they are in your ear or not and will therefore automatically play or pause your music this is a feature i always look for in a pair of truly wireless earbuds additionally they are water resistant so this means you can wear them out in the rain or say during a workout the earbuds themselves will magnetically sit in the charging case and as you can see the charging case actually features a couple of leds on the inside to illuminate the earbuds which is a nice touch now one thing i especially like about this case is this sliding mechanism it's just so satisfying to open and close and i could literally see myself doing this even if i'm not using the headphones the charging case itself has this very nice matte soft touch finish which i think looks quite sophisticated i especially like the use of minimal branding as you can see we just have a subtle soundcore logo on the top and then we have nothing on the bottom and what they've done is they've actually put all the regulatory information underneath the sliding hinge here which i think is quite smart as that keeps the case looking very clean in terms of the size i would say the charging case while it's not the smallest i've ever seen when you look at the height it is actually quite narrow and this is a really good thing as i find this way the charging case will have a lower profile in your pocket and just make it easier to carry around with you and then on the front we have some leds to indicate power as well as battery life and on the back we have the usb c port and also wireless charging at the bottom to charge the battery and then speaking of battery life uh the individual earbuds will give you eight hours of battery life which is definitely above average which would be around five to six for a pair of anc earbuds and then with the charging case you get a combined total of 32 hours of battery life again above the average of 24. and in my testing i definitely found these battery measurements to hold up listening at around 50 volume with anc on i get around 7 hours of listening time from just the earbuds i would say the battery performance of the liberty 3 pros is absolutely more than enough not only is it better than much of the competition it actually means you don't have to charge them more than once per week with daily use the earbuds pair seamlessly with bluetooth 5.2 and what this means is they can be paired to two devices at once so i like to have mine paired to my iphone as well as my macbook and then i can easily switch between the two throughout the day so what are they like to wear well i would say the earbuds themselves are slightly above average in terms of size but with the added support from the wingtip as well as the wide range of ear tips you actually can get a very comfortable and light feeling fit out of these earbuds now to insert them properly make sure that you first angle them up into the ear and then once they're in you twist them down to sort of lock that rear wing into place and once they are in they are really in during an intense workout these earbuds do not even come close to falling out while at the same time still being comfortable enough to wear several hours throughout the day before i talk about sound i want to talk about one of my favorite features of the liberty 3 pros and that is the built-in active noise cancellation now this can be toggled on and off directly from the earbuds and this is great if say you're waiting in line for your coffee and quickly need to speak to make your order but then want to switch back to turning on the anc all without reaching for your phone or removing your earbuds speaking of the transparency mode i found this to work quite well although it can make voices sound just a little bit robotic it does a very good job at identifying the voices and only letting those through so in that sense is very functional and useful to have when the anc is on it very effectively blocks out more consistent lower frequency noise so things like your car engine plane engine or even the train tracks and then less consistent more higher pitched noise so for example a crying baby will slightly come through but even this is only just now when it comes to anc on headphones and particularly on earphones i find that sometimes as a result of having the anc on you get this pressurized kind of feeling and compared to other anc earphones i found that the liberty 3 pros perform very well in this area causing minimal discomfort and again this makes them easier and more comfortable to wear for longer periods at a time okay but now let's get to what actually matters most and that is how do they sound well the soundcore liberty 3 pros have been endorsed by 20 grammy award-winning audio producers so let's see if they live up to the hype the frequency response goes all the way down from 20 hertz up to 40 kilohertz now this provides a very broad range across all frequencies the earbuds themselves feature soundcourse coaxial dual driver design and what this will provide are exceptional highs and lows and this is reflected in the sound profile which definitely has that v-shape again emphasizing the lower frequencies as well as the higher frequencies and what this creates is a very pleasing and exciting sound profile in my testing i found the liberty 3 pros to perform well with all genres of music but especially stand out with genres that have a little bit more bass so think things like hip hop pop as well as house music the lower frequencies are super tight punchy and deep while at the same time the higher frequencies are very clear and detail rich at the same time the mid-level frequencies remain present now out of the box i would have liked to see these be a bit more emphasized but thankfully this was easy to adjust in the app but i'll get on to that later for a pair of earbuds the sound stage was also surprisingly wide letting you hear and differentiate between all the different instruments in your track and then when it comes to listening to podcasts i was really impressed by how natural and true to life the voices sound and then to top it all off the liberty 3 pros get very loud i found myself comfortable at around 50 volume and this is something i can't say for any other pair of truly wireless earbuds so earlier i mentioned that the liberty 3 pros feature six built-in microphones so how do they perform well during a call test i found it to be clear on both ends i could easily hear the person i'm speaking with and they could clearly hear my voice despite being in some challenging conditions for example walking by a busy street i want to talk a little bit about the app now soundcore has a really fantastic app that allows you to customize your sound as well as other features of the liberty 3 pros for example if say you want a more flat sound profile this is completely possible too in the app you can simply adjust the eq and quickly save and create presets and then to make things easier soundcore also provides a bunch of presets to fit your mood or the kind of music that you're listening to and then there is here id now this was a feature that really took me by surprise what this does is it tests how you hear different frequencies at different volumes and then adjust the eq accordingly now this takes a couple of minutes to complete but in my opinion is absolutely worth it after taking the test myself what this did for me was it emphasized the mids and then slightly toned down the highs and this really made the sound even better i highly recommend trying this feature the app goes even further by letting you customize and fine tune the transparency mode as well as the anc now as someone who loves to customize their tech to really suit my needs and my style this is a feature that i've always missed on some other headphones such as the airpods at the end of the day the liberty 3 pros provide the sound as well as the features of the best of the best for example the airpods pros or the sony xm4s but do so while coming in at a significantly lower price points if you're looking for excellent sound quality that is also customizable anc long battery life water resistance multi-device support and much more for the price the liberty 3 pros are a fantastic choice as always i will leave all of the purchase links down in the description thank you very much for watching guys if you have any questions or comments be sure to leave them down below and i'll see you in the next video thanks for watching
Soundcore Liberty 3, i receive an email almost every day about reviewing some new wireless earbud and i've reviewed maybe six and i've probably had a dozen in here that never even got a video made about them because they were horrible so why am i reviewing another wireless earbud well because this one's pretty spectacular [Music] for my old job i used to travel a ton and was always looking for little travel solutions for charging and i found this cool little square it had a bunch of plug-ins around the side and it had usb charging not only to have usb charging it was quick charging so there was some brains going on inside and it would charge ipads headphones iphones very quickly and it was an anchor product and when i go to buy power strips or charging cables i almost always buy anchor products so what does that have to do with these well sound core is actually anker's top tier headphone and earbud line anker also makes some headphones under the anchor name but they're a lot less expensive i actually purchased three pair of soundcore earbuds before the channel ever started if you go on amazon and you look up soundcore headphones or earbuds there is a lot of reviews i'm talking tens of thousands of reviews on these i bought three pair of soundcore earbuds and i use them all the time i was even at walmart the other day and they have a small section of wireless headphones and they're not bad headphones they're bows they're sonys and guess what was right next to them soundcore which means soundcore is actually stocked and sold by walmart now it's not these i think they're a different model but i think the takeaway here is soundcore is not going anywhere and they are directly competing with bose and sony and i think they're taking a lot of market share away from bose and sony i like to have music with me at all times so if i'm shopping if i'm running errands and really when i'm mowing the lawn i especially want music noise canceling has never really moved the needle for me one way or the other but i always found that it really messed with the sound or it hurt my ears because there's too much pressure noise canceling for me never was i never liked it noise cancelling was never at the top of my priority list when it came to buying earbuds or headphones the irony is that the liberty 2 pro which is this one this video is about the liberty 3 pro this one doesn't have any noise cancelling and i didn't need it when i would mow the lawn it was actually it had good enough passive noise cancelling that i don't really need active noise cancelling so after a year of doing this channel there are specific products that i keep coming back to and i use the most and the irony is that soundcore wireless earbuds are one of the products that i use the most so these liberty pro three i think liberty pro three yeah i think that's right it comes in a little case the case actually slides up like that and then they have little leds inside which is pretty cool and they have leds right there and then the charging ports on the back it's a usbc there's also a pairing button back here so these are it pretty small and they fit right in here just like that and i was excited to get these because i use their older brother quite a bit these are the liberty pro 2s now the liberty pro 2s have a button the liberty pro 3s have touch controls let's talk about that i've had a half dozen products in here that use touch controls to change tracks turn the volume up turn the volume down answer calls hang up on calls and guess what they don't work sometimes they work every time 12 percent of the time they just don't work consistently so i was not thrilled when i learned that this one had touch controls because i like a button buttons rarely fail you can press it in and press it out number one you know when you pressed it number two generally the product knows when you depress something and close the circuit buttons are good buttons work the touch controls on the liberty pro 3 are the best implementation i've ever had there is another earbud that i have in here a wireless earbud that uses touch controls and it's way more expensive and it's unusable i didn't even do the review because it is so bad i would change things when i'd be pulling it out there would be all sorts of different noise cancelling modes i would turn on just by pulling them out of the case one of the coolest things about the liberty 3 pro is they have their own application and in that application you can change what the touch controls do so there's a one press a two press a three press and then a long press but the takeaway with the touch controls on these earbuds is it actually works dual driver technology so these have a balanced armature driver and a dynamic driver and companies can claim oh we have dual driver technology well that doesn't mean anything because i've heard dual driver i've heard 10 driver iems or earbuds that sound like garbage so it doesn't matter even though it has two drivers in here number one it doesn't mean they're balanced it doesn't mean they're combined properly and doesn't mean it's going to sound good so just because this has dual driver tech doesn't mean they're going to sound good the good news is it sounds pretty good one of the things about soundcore products is they don't really care about codex until now they have ldac and aac which means if you have a recent android phone you may be able to hook up ldac ldac is the bluetooth codec that can transfer the most amount of data does that actually translate into better music yeah it depends also has aac which is good because aac is what the apple platform uses for a bluetooth codec also has sbc spc is the catch-all bluetooth codec to me used to be pretty important however as i thought about things and as i enjoyed music on the previous generation sound core products which didn't have any fancy codecs i discovered that i was enjoying the music a lot and i think the reason why is it's kind of like listening to high-res music in the car 24-192 perfect recording perfect mastering the highest resolution you can get you're driving down the road with 65 db of road noise it doesn't matter how much detail you're actually hearing because you're not going to hear any detail because you have 65 db of road noise going on the opposite is true with iems if you have a driver that is five millimeters from your eardrum chances are you're going to hear a lot of detail even if it's an mp3 so you're probably going to hear more detail through a lossy codec or even a bad recording because it's so close to your ear add on top of that some really decent noise canceling and one is hearing a ton of detail and i would argue you're going to hear more detail out of a 170 dollar pair of wireless noise canceling iems than you probably will out of a 20 thousand dollar system that is just perfect because there's room stuff there's always stuff going on but there's not a lot of stuff going on when you have the driver a quarter inch from your eardrum while i'm happy this includes ldac and aac for bluetooth codecs i don't really think it matters all that much because i was really enjoying the music from the soundcore p3s and the liberty pro twos and they didn't have any fancy codecs something else that's cool about the liberty pro 3s they have an application it's a really good application within that application they have a hearing test you go through and you just listen get in a quiet room you listen and then you just do the hearing test and then it throws out an eq curve depending upon how you scored on the hearing test there are other products out there including android i think most androids you can do a hearing test and it will do something similar it'll spit out an eq curve for you i've tried that on multiple products including the android operating system and some much more expensive wireless iems never really worked out soundcore did a very good job with this hearing test it wasn't what i ended up with for my final eq but it was way better than other automated eq building programs and i think for a lot of people they're gonna enjoy that sound signature speaking of eq you can do your own eq you can save a bunch of eq profiles that you do yourself or you can go through their pre-set eqs and if you go to rock or r b and it's something that you will like but you want to tweak it a little bit you can go into custom and you can build upon their pre-built eqs to build something that is just right for you wireless earbuds for the most part now all have eq applications and it's good because you can get them to sound just about any way you want to and since this has a good driver that has actual clarity even if you warm these up a bit you're still going to hear a lot of detail again this isn't a feature that really moves the needle for me at all but what i will say is the noise canceling on these is very good when i say very good i mean it's not too heavy handed and when i say not too heavy handed i mean it's not putting pressure on my eardrum there is some type of technology in here that actually has some pressure equalization so you're not going to get that push on your eardrums that i hate so much the noise canceling works and it works better than any of the other wireless earbuds i've had that have noise cancelling the charge lasts a long time 32 hours if you're an adult just plug them in every now and again 32 hours unless you're trekking through the amazon rainforest looking for coronado's gold you're not going to need 32 hours of charging even if you wore them eight hours a day in the amazon you can still get four days out of them charging's fine you can plug them in for 15 minutes you'll get three hours of charge does it really matter if you get 20 plus hours of operation out of a wireless iem or earbud does it really matter if you're really concerned about it don't be 32 hours but just be an adult and plug them in at night so this is just like the apple earpods i know they're not called earpods i like to call them the earpods just like the apple earpods you plug them into here the case actually charges the earbuds and then you charge the case calls are good calls are great it's very good they have good microphones in here when i called some folks on here they were surprised i was talking on a wireless earbud so the calls is good if not great in ac and i mean a sea of wireless earbuds from klipsch jbl sony sennheiser just about everybody everybody and then there's offshoot brands that are trying to get into this market everybody has a wireless earbud and it's kind of surprising that a power strip company comes out with a wireless earbud and wireless headphone line that is just destroying all of the established players because these are spectacular they sound as good as some wired iems with a decent dongle deck and with the freedom to tweak the sound signature how you want in many cases these are going to be better than wired iems i know that's heresy oh my goodness but they are if i'm pressed for time i'm grabbing these movies i watched youtube on these all the time i listen to music all the time sometimes i listen to music for pure enjoyment not just background not just while i'm shopping they're that good the detail is incredible out of the box sound signature is now good it used to be really heavy-handed really bassy and i'd have to really bring down the bass quite a bit to get these where i want them to be they could be a little bit sibilant but even the flat sound signature on these is way better than the previous generation but the stock sound signature doesn't really matter because you can tweak it however you want to some people are going to say that wired iems are going to be better and in some cases they are going to be better in a lot of cases they're probably going to be better i don't know even at this price if you're going to get a wired iem that sounds better maybe with a dongle deck but by the time you add a dongle deck probably going to be around the same price point but it doesn't matter even if you have a wired iem and a good dongle deck that is cheaper and it's 25 better 35 percent better even if a product doesn't quite sound as good as something else if i use it more it's the right product for me if you need wireless earbuds for any reason i would take a hard look at the liberty pro threes because they are the best wireless earbuds that i've heard so if you want to support the

Soundcore Liberty 3, hey everyone today i'm finally going to be reviewing the soundcore liberty 3 pro and you know sometimes it's worth waiting around because these buds have been updated quite a bit since their initial release so things are a little bit different now but i can definitely say these buds are a banger they're coming in at 269 australian 149 us but they often go on sale quite a bit cheaper so make sure you check the links out below now today these buds are going to get the usual picky treatment we're covering everything and i'm also going to compare them to 14 different true arts earbuds because why not so no time to waste let's get straight into it as usual here we're going in down let's get into another picky review [Music] all right starting with the design here i got them in dusk purple don't really know why i felt like switching it up a little bit i can safely say now that purple probably isn't my color but at least i gave it a go despite whatever color you choose there are four to choose from they all look pretty good this is a nice looking bud there is a lot of bud though it's quite a chunky one so my initial thoughts of the fit weren't very high but as usual my initial impressions are wrong and the fit is actually really good included in the box you're getting four sizes of ear tips and wing tips so you can probably find a size that works for any ear for my giant ears i use the largest wing tip and the second largest ear tips and with this combo the buds slide in nice and smooth no mucking about so nice ergonomics and the actual feel of the ear tips a nice quality so the comfort is really great i normally test my buds mainly when i'm training which is normally over two hours no issues at all with discomfort these are also engineered with a bit of pressure relief so basically this means you don't get that pressure or suction in your ear canal now the security here considering it's quite a chunky bud with the help of that wingtip it's surprisingly good in my training sessions i've used these at least 20 times there's no way the buds are going to fall out of my ears the only issue i ran into was the buds kind of budging out ever so slightly when like making weird training faces setting up for a bench press like moving around a little bit again no way they're going to fall out but the still can be lost a little bit this just means i need a couple of extra readjustments here and there throughout my workouts so overall they're still solid they're not going to be my go-to training bud right now i'm still using the jabra elite 75t and jbl live pro plus but anyway if you like using your earbuds when training these have an ipx4 water resistant rating fine for sweat splash of the water using the rain you just can't submerge the buds in water now with the battery life you're getting an advertised eight hours from the earbuds 32 hours in total with noise cancelling off and six hours from the earbuds 24 hours in total with noise cancelling on and in my battery test on an iphone 10s at 70 volume with noise cancelling at full strength i got 5 hours and 20 minutes so just below the advertised amount there but pretty close you're also getting some pretty solid fast charging here so chuck the buds in the case for 15 minutes you're gonna get three hours of playback on the earbuds which is i think some of the best fast charge i've ever seen and the case can also be charged wirelessly and speaking of the case the actual build of it feels quite hollow it's a little bit light but the sliding mechanism works really great feels nice and smooth it's just taking the buds in and out of the case at first feels incredibly strange it took me like two months to get used to it but i honestly could have just sat down and probably figured it out in like 10 minutes but i just want to suffer for some reason but once you get it you're all good now let's talk about the touch controls i love seeing this with my true wild earbuds you get complete customization of each individual touch control in the app so you can tailor it to whatever you like and you can also include your volume controls in there you even have the option to completely disable each touch function so a good example of this is disabling the single tap because that can be something people don't like using because it's easy to activate a single tap rather than a double tap and you're also getting some inner detection some of the slowest that i've ever seen it def it's 100 the slowest it takes about three seconds for your music to pause or play when you take the earbud in and out of your ear and look three seconds might not sound terrible but normally it's instant with most e-bars even budget earbuds it takes under one second so not a deal breaker but a little bit weird but thankfully if you don't like it you can just turn that off in the app as well now onto connectivity you got the usual spc and aac but the quite rare ldac codec for some high resolution streaming only on android can you do this and test it on my samsung galaxy s10e you're basically going to be getting about a 10 improvement in your streaming quality it's basically going to be closer to what you would get with a wide pair of earbuds so not a massive difference but it's nice to have there just keep in mind it will use a decent amount more battery life and the connection probably won't be as stable as spc or aac now another rare feature you're getting here that just doesn't seem to be on any earbud nowadays is true multi-point connection so yes that means you can connect two devices to the earbuds at the same time so you could basically have your earbuds connected to your phone and your laptop and it's very easy to switch between you have to disconnect or reconnect just pause playback on one device play it on the next it doesn't work 100 seamlessly all the time i've never seen that with any multi-point connection but it works really well and it's great to see it because you never see it on any trials earbuds so nicely done sound cool it's not all good though there's a little mini con here and that's with single earbud use you can use one earbud while the other rest in the case but the earbud that you are using doesn't work in mono mode so you're not going to be hearing both the left and right audio channel in the one earbud so not a deal breaker you still can hear the audio fine it just doesn't work in mono mode which you kind of see nowadays that's kind of a common thing and another slight con here is that there is no low latency mode so this is mainly going to help with gaming if you're watching videos all that kind of stuff there's barely any latency to be seen now here are my detailed latency results on both ios and android generally if you're like looking for real low latency 200 milliseconds around that is about as low as it gets as long as you're below 400 milliseconds or around that for casual games you'll be fine but now let's jump on over to the indoor and outdoor microphone tests all right so here is a microphone test with the soundcore liberty 3 pro currently in a nice quiet environment all right now i've currently got some proud simulation noise playing quite loud off the bookshelf speakers right behind me to give you a rough idea of the ability for these microphones to block out some background noise all right so here we are in the outside world with the soundcore liberty free pro on a nice busy motorway here right now with cars flying past at over 110 kilometers an hour so if you can block out the noise behind me to do well with any noise in the world and now i'm currently using my airpods pro which are known to have some very nice mic quality they're my go-to pair of evas when i'm on phone calls so i wanted to compare them to the airpods to see what the difference was all right before we talk about noise cancelling a quick little drop on my instagram if you want to see updated with behind the scenes action to me my audio ventures link is down below on the noise cancelling and quickly how i test my noise cancelling to keep it nice and even across the board i chuck my soundbar on and play simulation playing train noise and crowd noise and this gives me a good idea of the noise cancelling performance and the soundcore liberty 3 pro in my anc ranking are falling in just behind the quality of the airpods pro there so they work great at blocking out consistent low frequency noises like in my plane noise test it was with the crowd noise so voices and more high frequency noises they didn't do as good of a job as blocking those sounds out as all those buds above there and just keep in mind this anc ranking is for me it's for my ear canals it's for how the buds fit my ears and how the noise cancelling algorithm used on the buds work for me it's going to be different for everyone other reviewers is going to be different so just keep that in mind people so it's not the best noise cancelling but it's definitely up there with the best of the best but there are some pretty cool features here that make up for it the first feature is the here id noise cancelling which basically tailors the noise cancelling performance to your ear canal you run through a quick test and having an on and off i noticed it helped the noise cancelling ever so slightly and with my ranking that's with my here id anc on as well now the second feature which isn't really a feature it's to do with eq shift that's how your sound quality changes with noise cancelling on compared to noise cancelling often normally with noise cancelling on your sound quality is reduced but that's kind of switched here on the liberty 3 pro because with noise cancelling on i have to say they sound a little bit better and this sound quality is going to be the same with transparency mode on as well so with noise cancelling off the bass is increased by about 15 percent and it becomes a bit overly boomy for my liking and the mid-range also falls back ever so slightly it's not a huge change but it's there so an easy fix here is to just never use noise cancelling off so you have to worry about the sound quality changing so what i did was just jump in the control settings and you can choose what you want to activate when switching your ambient controls and i just turned noise cancelling off off so i'm only switching between noise cancelling on and transparency mode now i normally wouldn't want to do this because there are times when i want to have voice cancelling off because i might not be in a noisy environment but thankfully soundcore has a solution with their adaptive noise cancelling so basically how this works is the noise cancelling strength which goes from low medium to high will adjust depending on how noisy the environment is around you and i tested this with my soundbar on and kind of turned the volume up and down and it normally would react pretty fast within to ten seconds of the volume change so it's great if you're like just chilling at home and you don't need strong noise cancelling on the buzz will just automatically adjust it for you which will save battery life but also more importantly reduce that kind of noise cancelling pressure and suction that you can get when the noise canceling is on height and if you don't want to use this you can also just manually have it always on high medium or low so that was cool feature number three and now on to number four we've got wind noise reduction these buds really do have it all basically how that works is whenever the earbuds detect a lot of wind coming through the microphones it'll attempt to reduce that wind noise it's not going to reduce it completely it's probably going to cut it down by about 50 percent like if you're riding really fast on a motorbike or a bike or whatever the wind noise is still going to come in but it is going to cut it down quite a bit i don't ride a bike or a motorbike but i tested it with a blow dryer which is a decent amount of wind and it cut out about 50 of the blow dryer so we've got some really nice features there but a not so great feature is a transparency mode it's not terrible still gets the job done i rated a solid 7.5 out of 10 on my transparency scale with a pair like the airpods pro being about 10 out of 10. so it's not the most natural has a bit of white noise hissing in the background whether you have the full transparency mode on or the vocal mode i found vocal mode kind of amplified voices a little bit better and it can kind of cut out more consistent low frequency sounds but there's not a huge difference between the two modes there and i did find a bit of a bug with the transparency mode it's also happened with noise cancelling i found randomly like one earbud would have noise cancelling or transparency mode on and the other one not have it on as strong but an easy fix just chuck the buzzes in the case take them out and it's all good but now before we talk about sound quality first touching up on volume if you want some loud level listening i've heard people saying these aren't loud enough at 100 they are definitely loud enough there are definitely louder buds out there i rate these about an 8 out of 10 on the loud listening scale but when you're at those high volumes the buzz do retain the same sound quality no issues with distortion and if you're looking for low level listening these bugs easily get my bedtime certification so even if you're on the first three clicks of volume these buds are nice and quiet if you want to listen to some nice low-level music or podcasts before bed which i personally like doing but now under the sound quality itself and i'm going to start by saying thankfully these have an eq customization because right out of the box they sound great but it's kind of just treble and bass very nice treble and bass but the treble does get a little bit too harsh for my liking the bass i really like though i'm giving it a solid 8 out of 10 on my subwoofer scale it's a pretty perfect balance of that deep subwoofer bass tiny bit of boom but it still retains a bit of punch and keep in mind is definitely not a natural bass response these are a bass heavy tuning the mids are also just a little bit too recessed for my liking so instrumentation and vocals can fall behind a little bit right out of the box it's quite a v-shaped tuning basically a lot of bass and treble and recessed mids but instrument separation is pretty solid but it's a sound stage that even with this tuning is the widest i've ever tested in any true lcd bud which also for a bass heavy earbud is very rare it has better sound stage than the airpods pro sennheiser momentum 2 and sony wf xm4 not miles better but they do have a slight edge so overall it's still a great sound but with that great eq customization you have some pretty nice freedom to customize these to your liking you still can't make this sound i would say like a natural or flat sounding earbud even if you bring the bass all the way down in the eq there's still going to be quite a lot of it but you can balance these out quite a bit and with my customization here's what i got i just kind of boost the mids bring down the mid bass ever so slightly and just dial down that treble ever so slightly as well and i must say these sound a lot better at least for my ears you can also save your own presets or use the included presets from soundcore which honestly aren't the best there's also a 3d surround mode which sounds quite strange and you can also run through a here id sound test to optimize the sound quality to how you hear basically uh that also sounded very strange to me but maybe you did a few let me know and to wrap it up they've also got 14 presets from grammy award winning producers and fun fact after i did my eq'ing i played around with the grammy presets and apparently buck snow and i have almost the exact same eq customization so does this mean i'm a grammy producer now i think so anyway back to the sound take everything i mentioned of how they sound out of the box with my eq customization the mids are a lot more forward now you get better vocal clarity better instrument separation but at the same time i've kind of tuned them in a way to try and stick true to the original sound core tuning and i think i've done pretty well with it the only real issue with the tuning here is with the treble it's some of the nicest most sparkly trouble that i've ever tested with great detail but even when bringing it down a bit with my eq customization above 75 80 volume on certain songs that are mastered just with a bit more high end it can still get a little bit harsh a little bit sibilant on vocals and you can just bring the trouble down further if you like but you start to lose a bit of sparkle when you start going below negative two decibels there but now with my eq customization it's tailored to what i like it might not be what you like i can thankfully say these are not the overall best sounding buds that i've tested but they do have the best bass to clarity ratio and if you follow my channel you know i'm all about as much bass as you can get while still retaining as much clarity and the liberty 3 pro easily the new number one just keep in mind there are buds that have more bass buds with better clarity and overall sound quality and i will be comparing these to those 14 earbuds in just a second but first let's run through the generating checklist here are all the results so with edm hip hop and r b very vocal driven music you get great clarity with your vocals here and a nice amount of bass always works well with those genres metal i'm giving it a solid 9.5 out of 10. being a drummer myself this kind of tuning with that nice sparkly treble brings out high hats ride cymbals crashes all that good stuff your double kicks come through with nice presents nice punch and you also get all this with great separation and kind of sticking true to that kind of like live heavy sound which is how i love listening to my middle these are probably my favorite metal earbud right now now that i think of it i'm gonna yes yes they are and this carries over to rock that nice base works really well basically any instrumentation orchestration acoustic guitars female vocals it all comes through with nice presence it's great separation and the sound stage also carries the sound through very well now with hard style trap and dubstep i brought the score down ever so slightly because there are bass ear buds out there and they still give you a decent amount of bass but for example i was in the gym and i normally just crank the earbuds at 100 on some angerfist a bit of hardcore to get me going and it sounds great but i do prefer a pair like the jabra 75t when i'm going for a nice heavy set with as much bass as possible i also brought down cytrans ever so slightly because the bass response here is a little bit over the top so i find a punchier bass response works a little bit better with sidetrans again you can just eq these if you want that kind of sound and they'll sound a lot better because the separation and sound stage here is some of the best and it works great with psytrance and look basically every other genre is going to sound great as long as you like your bass again these are not a balanced earbud you can make them more balanced but still they're bassy but now it's comparison time and i'm going to break this comparison down into three very weirdly named sections section one we've got earbuds with over the top base section two over the top base but not as over the top and section three balance but still a nice amount of bass makes sense moving on so let's start with section one over the top base because these are all buds that if you eq the liberty 3 pro as much as you can at a more bass you're still not going to be able to get the same bass response as these earbuds but you can get pretty close so that's why i'm comparing them here so on pairs like the sound piece h1 the sonic the jbl 230 nc these are all buds with more bass but when it comes to clarity it's an easy win for the liberty 3 pro the jabra elite 75t though come pretty close to the liberty when it comes to clarity they actually have a very similar tuning which is actually quite surprising because you're getting noticeably more bass on the 75t i give that a 9.5 out of 10 on my subscale compared to the 8 out of 10 on the liberty 3. still detail sound stage and instrument separation is better on the liberty 3 but i got to give it to the 75t they come very close and they're quite an old bud and are noticeably cheaper than liberty 3 pro so if you like more crazy over-the-top bass 75t you're probably gonna be the go now on to section two buds with over-the-top bass but not as over the top because these are all buds that have a pretty similar tuning similar amount of bass to the liberty 3. but it's no contest here all the buds there the liberty 3 pro easily sound better overall that was an easy one now onto section 3 the final stage balance but with still a nice amount of bass and starting with the airpods pro the most balanced out of the five there i'm not going to say which one's better i prefer the liberty 3 because i like my bass the airpods pro are just a more flat balanced sound which i know a lot of people like so it really depends on what you like there but for me when i have the airpods in and then i chuck the liberty 3 pro in they just sound way better for me this is kind of similar with the bose quiet comfort buds and galaxy buds pro so those are pairs where your vocal presence and detail is slightly better again more balanced it really depends what you like for me liberty 3 pro win for you it might not be the same now compared to my long time favorite bass to clarity bud the sennheiser momentum 2 things start to get a little bit spicy here because i honestly don't really know what pair i like better after testing these out for months the momentum 2 has a kind of similar v-shape tuning but it is more on the balance side so i wouldn't say the instrument separation or detail is better it's just kind of again it's a slightly different experience i like both buds it kind of depends on how i'm feeling which pair i would like better if i was to only choose one liberty 3 pro yeah now compared to the sony wf xm4 it's much easier to tell the xm4s push out better clarity and detail especially when it comes to vocals but you just can't get the same bass response the liberty hub even if you eq the bass on the sony's as much as you possibly can so just sound quality xm4 bass liberty 3 pro so there you go probably one of my longer sound quality explanations but to wrap it up here it's not just the sound quality and the nice bass heavy sound that make these a great bud it's about how they don't get everything perfect but unlike any butt i've tested everything is solid it's the easy fit the battery life the ldap codec multi-point connection solid noise cancelling great mic quality customisable controls and great sound except for maybe the transparency mode that's the only slight issue but everything else you can't really fault and i can easily say that all the 14 buds that are compared and pretty much any bud that i've tested doesn't hit all these areas as well as liberty 3 pro do so nicely done soundcore for making the best all-rounder true while seabud you can currently get but that wraps it up for today if you do like your bassy buds be sure to check out this video right here but in the meantime stay picky i'll see you in the next video bye now
Soundcore Liberty 3, [Music] see that little town called homes [Music] so five months ago we took a look at the soundcore liberty 3 pro and compared it with some of the flagship options out there and if you haven't checked out this video yet you can take a look at them right up here and when we looked at the liberty 3 pro back then i thought it was an absolute solid bit performer and gave it a really good score in terms of performance sound quality anc as well as overall build and design and five months later i have been using them on and off and i also left it on my nightstand to listen to music at night so i'm here to share with you what i think about these earbuds today after using it for a couple of months so the liberty 3 pro steel comes in at around 170 us dollars and prices for its competition such as the bose qc earbuds the sony wf-1000xm4 and the airpods pro are still pretty much the same so in terms of value for money i would say the liberty 3 pro is still a very attractive price earbuds especially for all the features sound quality and anc performance so i have always taught the design of the liberty 3 pro to be really beautiful the case is also well made and the led light inside that shines through the earbuds simply looks fantastic and when reviewing it a couple of months back i felt that it is quite a comfortable earbud i have then also used the earbuds for a couple of more hours throughout the day and i have found out that after an extended period of use probably around three to four hours of use i start to get some ear fatigue and i believe it is because of the shape of the earbuds and how the wing tips presses against your ears that causes the pain so if you take a look at the earbuds here the wingtips kind of stick out quite a bit of course you can change this to different sizes but this is the one that fits me really well but it does press against the inside of my ears when you wear it for short periods of time it's fine but when you wear it for slightly extended periods of hours like three to four hours then it starts to hurt so unfortunately this is also the same case as the sony as well as the bose and the most comfortable of them all is kind of still the airpods pro where you will still get pain after a couple of hours but you can wear them for longer periods compared to all of these different competitions out there and design wise i think these are quite hardy so i personally care for my earbuds and gadgets and you can see even after months of casual use they still look kind of pristine kind of nice and i tried not to toss them around or you know hold it with my dirty hands i must say it really hold up quite well and although my unit was white you can see that it did not turn yellow because i think the material here is a little bit of the pearl white type of finish so it doesn't really change color or this color and the earbuds itself also held up really well you can see that it's still very white and pristine there's no yellow markings around so i think that's pretty nice so my only problem with this is that it doesn't have any aftermarket case that i can put it onto the unit since i'm quite paranoid about my gadgets getting scratched up or dinging so far being careful with it really has paid off but i still don't like living on the edge both my sony wf-1000xm4 as well as the airpods pro permanently lives inside a case so honestly battery life isn't a big issue for me and i think for my personal use case i think they lasted longer than i can honestly use them every day and in my everyday use i don't really use the ldac codec for my usual stream since i used an iphone 12 pro and i have to be realistic that's the phone that i travel with day in and day out so using this earbuds with it i'm pretty much always in the aac codec with the anc turned on i prefer to use anc so i never really turn them off i use them without being too loud since they do get quite loud i mostly use them around 20 30 volume only since i work in quite a quiet environment so six to seven hours of use really isn't much of an issue for me and sometimes i really don't get to use them for such a long stretch at a time as well so realistically i think four or five hours of use definitely not a problem for these earbuds chuck them back into your case and the quick charging will quickly top them up to 100 and i always have a wireless charger on my desk and if i use these earbuds the case will sit on the wireless charger permanently to be topped up so when i move around i grab it and it's always topped up so that's a bonus plus point for me so speaking of volume i think the volume has been consistent i haven't seen any degradation in terms of volume and honestly after burning in the drivers i think they sound actually quite nice and the volume is still really solid so a comfortable listening volume for me is around 20 to 30 percent and pushing it up to 50 is quite loud for me honestly 60 is already too loud for me and i rarely push them so high up so i'm still giving them thumbs up for the volume after so many months so in terms of anc unfortunately i haven't been able to fly with these earbuds yet so that's one thing that i really wanted to test in the future and i still stand by that these earbuds are one of the best in anc performance and i believe if you've tried them with good fitting you definitely can agree with that as well the sony and bose are both really good examples of anc earbuds and to be honest using them for a long time now i would just say that they are all on par and equally as good since either one that you get you're gonna get amazing anc performance so i don't think that one or two percent difference in anc performance really makes a difference one way i love using anc earbuds is when it rains out if your earbuds can knock out 100 of rain noise with some soft music playing that's a testament to how great a pair of anc earbuds that you have and all the sony the bose and the soundcore manages to do that and surprisingly the airpods pro is the only one that cannot really mask off that rain noise but it's pretty darn close so is the sound signature still impressive for the liberty 3 pro and i would say an absolute yes no change to my opinion with the sound signature and it still tums like the first day i unboxed them and to be honest after burning them in i think they are even better sounding so base here is still really powerful and clean giving you a very solid powerful thumb through each beat and after listening it to a while you start to be able to tell the drivers apart because the dynamic driver just pumps out insane amount of power and bass but at the same time the mid and highs are still crisp and clear it's like the two frequencies just don't mind each other and play really well together and that's where this nose ba driver really shines however with my own eq tuning i do notice that some songs will actually get a little ear piercing with higher volumes because i mainly like to tune my earbuds to be a little bit brighter so some songs really does get pushed quite high and gets a little ear piercing but with that happening i'll just lower down the volume so overall i'm still very impressed with the sound quality here with the liberty 3 pro so will i still be buying these earbuds in 2022 and if i am in a market looking for a high performing earbuds below the 200 us dollar range i would definitely say yes but if you can afford the other earbuds like the sony or both of course they all have their own advantages and their own app layer which is fantastic i'll say why not because since they are also very highly rated earbuds both the bose as well as the sony personally i would say that the sound core is really mingling at the same level as those flagship earbuds so definitely give this a go if you haven't so that is it for this long term review if you find this video helpful smash that thumbs

gonna give these away either during my next stream or i'm just gonna do a regular giveaway i got two tablets and three sets of earbuds so far so i'm trying to get up to maybe like eight to ten products that i'm going to give away all at once all right so three of these will be part of the giveaway i'll keep one for myself all right here we go let's get into this now on the side note everybody been asking me for the iphone 13 review i'm gonna do that this weekend okay now i'm just coming back from vacation i've been drinking smoking gambling doing all kind of crazy i'm trying to get back in the hangar making videos again so this is my second video back so um bear with me y'all bear with me okay here we go let's see what you guys okay nice presentation i like that i like that off the top let's see get the perfect fit now you got a bunch of different size ear tips let's see now shoes can't wait to get up in here i'm gonna try to do this shoes proof okay so you got something

these better a little sound called logo on each one i went with the medium-sized ear tips best fit for me let me go ahead and slap these in okay now as far as noise isolation you can definitely feel it okay nice comfortable fit now let me do the head shake test i'm going to start off with minimum shakeage okay no movement intermediate shakage no movement scared shoes away and maximum shakeage ah okay no movement so you can easily work out with these earbuds in now let me show you how they're gonna look again i always go for the bean style as opposed to the pencil style y'all see the uh louis vuitton durag i'm doing it big nice sleek looking earbuds a little bit on the big side but i can rock with these all right so now let's take a look at the soundcore app now once you open it up you got a picture of your earbuds you got your battery percentage for the left the right and the charging case now let's go through some of the different ambient sound settings and on the side note i'm wearing the earbuds right now these have real active noise cancellation are you gonna have to do the hair id test i used a little fan on the side to simulate noise and when these really work now i'm wearing the earbuds i got it on full transparency mode you can put on vocal mode if you want now i'm going to turn it off now this is normal all right so now it sounds like i just got a set of regular earbuds i can still hear the ambient sounds of life you know not any wind or any noise but you know you just hear life going on around you like it's kind of quiet down here right now but i can tell that i'm alive i can tell i'm alive the sounds of life now watch this i'm going to put on here id a and c now it seems like somebody just flipped the switch and it's super quiet this is when it's so quiet that you can hear your your blood vessels you can hear your thoughts all right and this really works watch this now you can change from strong weak or moderate if you put it on strong this is a lot of noise cancellation i'm impressed i can't wait to take these outside and try them out in the streets but as of right now i'm impressed it's super quiet i'm gonna put it back on normal okay now normal sounds like regular earbuds with noise isolation no uh fancy noise cancellation just normal earbuds and back to transparency mode all right all right fully transparent all right now i can breathe again i was a little too quiet i could hear the pain drop i can hear my snaps this is what i'm going to leave it on right now i don't have to yell alright so you got your wind noise reduction here i d test make sure you do that when you first get the earbuds it's not a gimmick it's like an old-school herring chest but it's going to custom tune the earbuds to your specific hearing okay so you got the sound effects you got here id sound you got 3d surround sound now you can't use that with ldac you got your default sound core signature and you got custom now my usual custom is a lot of bass mid mids and a lot of i like a lot of highs mid mids and high lows that's my custom eq settings that i usually rock with we'll call that bass and rock out like that let's see you got your sound mode okay now you could prefer audio quality or combined audio quality connection you got your controls now these are fully customizable all right so for single tap on the left and the right earbud you can change them if you want so if my single tap on the right earbud i got playing pause for the left ear bud we'll have next track now i'm going to fully customize these double tap hold for two seconds and tap three times let's see anything else they got more settings okay so you got your serial number you got weird detection so if you're wearing your earbuds and uh you stop you want to stop the music just take them off when you put the earbuds back in the music will start playing you got your prop tone your fit chest auto power off okay i'll leave it on uh 120 minutes or you can just have it always stay on you got your update firmware and your quick start guide that's pretty much it simple and straightforward all right so now let's do a sound test i got a classic song chewed up we got roses by outcast which on the side note i heard this in vegas after i had about a half a bottle of gray goose i thought i was 103 000 for a minute i had the song been stuck in my head ever since then i'm gonna start off with my eq settings to my custom base i got active noise cancellation turned on and we're going to start off with max volume okay now i promise y'all i'm not going to sing birdman hands rubbing together i got my microphone just in case let's hit play on the music here we go okay now so far that piano sounds crispy okay now i already like the liberty pro too so i already know i'm gonna like these oh that piano sounds nice and clear okay here we go oh hold on hold on hold on hold up whoa let's go yo yo i just scared shoes away whoa hold up let me start that again bro nah nah these sound dope hold up i was not expecting that yo hold up all right the piano dropping again okay wow these are super loud too oh caroline feel the vines and bling blue fish it's hard to find but might find only get you somewhere half the time yo the sound joke here we got you comes out even now even though you need a golden calculator to survive whoa let's go ah no you don't like the thing yo don't stink but lean a little bit closer to your roots just really smell like boo boo yeah roses really smell like boo boo okay hold up whoa i know you like the thing yo don't say it hold up hold up hold up no just actually my eyes let me press skip holy i have to do the echo on that holy bro whoa now last year when i did the sound corp the liberty 2 pros i had the same reaction yo these sound incredible these sound incredible now hold up i'm going to put them back in real quick wow now i know y'all think i'm being a hypebeast but y'all know i keep it a buck with y'all i got to do the bass test on this let's take it over to um nipsy hustle blue laces here we go blue laces too okay here we go oh baby okay here we go here we go okay hold up okay [Applause] yes okay okay let's go smoking oh my god hold up let's see one type of playing boys okay bro the highs the mids crystal clear that bass was thumping just now and i can probably get more bass from the eq settings on the app these are fishy tissue now i was already feeling that outcast rose's song if y'all haven't heard that the piano at the beginning was nice and clean but when it kicked in it kind of knocked me out of my seat a little bit i wasn't expecting to hear like a full a full symphony orchestra right right in my head that was dope all right now i'm a headphonologist all right air biologists i like this kind of i like these i i like these so far now i'm going to test out a few more songs and let's do our rest of our usual testing and let me calm down a little bit i'm back here i'm starting to sweat these are dope though i i'm stamping these down with the seal of approval the sound quality on these is major major all right the sound quality is major let's keep it moving now let's do the reconnection test how long do these take to reconnect your phone after you take them out and put them in a charging case let's hit play on the music okay okay so i'm gonna take these out okay let's drop them in the case there's one there's the other let's close it up let's make sure it's disconnected okay didn't disconnect yet all right there it is here we go one mississippi two mississippi okay already connected just like that see the music is playing back in my ears all right so two mississippis that's pretty dope all right so now let's do the one ear bud test can you play music from one earbud what other one is charging up in the case all right here we go so i got the music playing i'm gonna take out the left earbud drop it in the case okay now it automatically pause let's see playing the music again okay the music is playing okay put the left side back in wait for it to reconnect okay now that it reconnected check out the right side just drop this in the case okay the music paused let's hit play on the left side and there it is this is dope you can play music from either earbud while the other one is charging up in the case basically doubling the battery life now let's check the touch controls and on the side note these are fully customizable but here's how i got mine set up so one tap for playing pause that'll also answer them phone calls okay there it is double tap that'll take me to the next song okay triple tap that'll take me to the previous track okay now if i press and hold for two seconds on the left earbud that's gonna cycle between active noise cancellation and transparency mode and noise cancellation off so i'm gonna press and hold for two seconds i heard a little prompt it went boom boom now i can hear that active noise cancellation is definitely on everything is super quiet i'm gonna press and hold for another two seconds boom okay now transparency mode is on i can hear my voice and my snaps and if i press and hold for two seconds on the right earbud that's gonna bring up my voice assistant what's the weather for tomorrow all of the test controls work now on a side note like i said it's fully customizable i don't have volume up and down but you can add that if you want all right now i wanted to show you all that multi-point connection does work you see i'm connected on my galaxy z fold three and i'm also connected on my iphone okay and one more thing just so you can see that the multi-point actually works i'm gonna play some music all right now it's coming out of the earbuds now i'm gonna play it on my iphone and it's playing out on my iphone all right so multi-point connection does work all right so now let's check the call quality i'm calling amaya okay sound called liberty three let's get max volume now maya's pretty busy these days i don't know if she got time for any peasantry that i'm over here involved with but let's see let's hope for the best what time is it all right now it's 7 44. am i probably in practice i gotta call somebody else all right hold up i'm gonna call somebody else we're gonna have we're gonna have to call the 24-hour diner and see what time they close i know y'all the struggles is real struggles is real let's do hour diner all right here we go doing this in lifetime y'all my bad yeah okay here we go okay calling the 24-hour diner liberty pro 3 let's get max volume yeah hi y'all what time you guys close today oh 24 hours okay now say i want to order something can i order through you or do i go through ubereats okay how do i sound does my voice sound good that sounds great [Laughter] i'm gonna call you back all right okay thank you bye-bye [Music] she said it's time she said it sounds great baby that kind of threw me off guard that was wrong with me today yeah yeah you know it'll be fine i gotta start eating at that diner more often all right here we go phone call quality no issues she sounded great she said i don't know why that made me laugh so but she said i sounded great so no issues with that let's keep it moving all right so let me sum up the rest of the video now i did the bluetooth range test and walked all the way to 50 feet no drop connection at all after that i watched some youtube videos some netflix some amazon prime no lag when you're watching the videos now i had to go to the store to get white shoes some dinner so i tested out active noise cancellation and transparency mode now when it comes to transparency mode perfect okay you can easily have a conversation without taking the earbuds off i was talking to my next-door neighbor just now uh i know the yankees is out of the playoffs so we had he had a little uh choice words for me but it is what it is i still was able to have that conversation with my ear buds in then after that i went to the bodega i did i said that correctly the bodega got white shoes some dinner active noise cancellation on these is top tier remember i got three tears we got trash tear okay tear and top tier all right in this day and age there's no number one number two number three noise cancellation unless you're talking about god tear with the sony's and the bows everything else after that is either top tier okay tear or trash tear these are easily top tier noise cancelling ear buds easily all right now in my bulldog every time i go i'm trying i'm trying to use the correct terminology every time i go up in there they playing up achatha music i turned on my active noise cancellation you can still hear it a little bit but it drowned out a lot of the noise okay now and in my car when i'm sitting in the car i was playing my new song lotto i big energy that's my song so i'm warming up the car my car is an easy way to simulate an airplane engine at v10 monster sound engine it drowned out a lot of the engine noise so top tier noise cancellation no issues with these okay call quality is great battery life is great the sound quality alright now even if these were non-noise cancelling earbuds i would be raving about these i was playing around with the sony phone testing out some ldac let me tell you something okay the sound quality on these earbuds is right up there with the sennheiser cx okay but under 200 bucks on a scale of 110 i'm giving these a major major major goal sound quality is gonna blow you away okay it sounds like like i said um their song roses by outcast i felt like i had a symphony orchestra in my head at the beginning of that song pianos you know you the flutes the violins the cellos the xylophones and let's hear all of these instruments that i haven't heard in a long time on that song i heard with these earbuds now i'm just talking right now but honestly i love these i the sound quality if you're an audiophile all right and you don't want to spend audiophile money on earbuds these and the sennheisers are the quotes the closer you're gonna get for under 200 bucks now i'm not going to compare these to my top ten just yet because i got way too many earbuds and these just popped up today i these popped up today the marshall motif ancs i still got the razors the nora's the jbl's the oneplus let me know what y'all want to do now i think it's going to take a long time if i do one video each of all these earbuds i might have to do my top 10 like i did the top 10 last time where i'm just i got my original top eight and then i just breezed through a whole bunch of different ones at the same time let me know if y'all want to do it like that or do i want to do maybe two or three two or three more videos with jbl versus hammerhead these versus the nora buds let me know all right but i want to do my top 10 but before i do my top 10 i got to give everybody a fair chance all right now them the regular marshall earbuds they was dope but no anc that was a no-go for me now they added anc so i might put these in the runnings but back to the soundcore liberty 3 pros all right these are triple major gold worth every single goddamn cent all right i don't care what you pay for these if you pay under 200 bucks you win now like i said earlier too i got three more extra paydays shout out to soundcore i i'm not i don't know if they wanted me to show you how the colors and all that but yeah it is what it is um i don't have time to open all these all these earbuds and at the same time why open these all up if i could give them the yaw all right so for everybody who supports my live streams when i do the next live stream i'm giving away three pair earbuds i'm giving away two tablets and a couple of phones all right we're gonna make it interesting a couple of phones maybe get the total of 10 prizes all right so so far we got five we're gonna work our way up to ten i'm doing my next stream not this sunday the next sunday after that all right not this sunday the following sunday anyway hit me up in the comments let me know what y'all think about these i'm impressed all right i'm very impressed these earbuds are the truth right great active noise cancellation great battery life great call quality but the sound now you buying these for the sound quality you're not going to be disappointed trust me when i tell you that hit me up in the comments let me know what you think about these shout outs everybody rocking with me on facebook foursquare twitter google plus shout out to all the google gangsters i see

Soundcore Liberty 3," When Sony released the WF 1000 XM4s, it 
probably counted on its lead in the true   wireless space to remain for a while to 
come. So do the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro   poop all over Sony’s party? That’s exactly 
what we’re gonna talk about today. Poop.
   Goedendag we’re DHRME, Developing 
High Resolution Multimedia Everyday. ANC
   Sony’s strongest suit is its sheer noise 
cancelling power, so let’s start with that.   The SoundCore has two transparency modes 
- vocal mode and fully transparent,   and TBH - there’s difference between the two modes 
except for the hiss - more hiss in vocal mode. Sony’s transparency is clearly louder, and there’s 
a clearer difference when you ‘focus on voice’,   lower end frequencies are pretty absent. On the 
Liberty 3, not only is the overall volume lower,   but also there’s more of a hiss present. When you 
select vocal mode, this is even more amplified.
   ANC is similar between the two. The Sony might be 
very slightly better, but if you put the ANC of   the SoundCore on a $400 pair of earbuds, I would 
still take them! This one’s for all you Bowers and   Wilkins apologists out there! And hey you don’t 
believe us? Hear the difference for yourselves. Sound Quality:
The Sony is marginally louder,   and they sound fine, BUT! The Liberty 3 Pro 
SMOKE the Sony WF 1000 XM4. This is just…   bull sh*t. The dual drivers on the SoundCore 
are really showing who’s boss here.   The one good thing about the Sony’s WAS that 
the EQ gave you a ton of customisation options,   but that advantage also goes to the SoundCore 
Liberty 3 Pro. They take EQ really well! The   one place where there’s a slight difference is 
that the Sonys are a bit more consistent with ANC   and transparency mode on, whereas we detected 
a slight change in character on the Soundcore   with ANC on and off. But man - that’s like saying 
the knocked out boxer had better looking gloves. For the Soundcore, volume is louder on Android on 
LDAC compared to iPhone. And even though iPhone   doesn’t have the --use voice-- ‘THE BEST CODEC’, 
it still sounds GREAT! Don’t get too obsessed with   the codec names, hardware and tuning have shown us 
time and again that they matter more than codecs.
   Now you know us - we go DEEP DEEP INTO THE 
BEEP BEEP with our Frequency Response charts,   and we wanted to do a bass, mids, treble, 
soundstage comparison, but we abandoned   that discussion mid way through the A/B testing 
because - there’s simply no point! This round is   for the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros and shots have 
been fired here - Sony needs to up its game! Extras:
 
When it comes to extras and features, both   of these support single bud use - Sony still has 
that weird bug though where if you enable Google   Assistant, you can’t use the left bud just on its 
own. So… don’t do that. Don’t do Google Assistant. Both have touch controls, although I think 
the Sony’s touch controls are more responsive.   However, you get volume control in combination 
with all the regular media playback on the   Soundcore, which in our view gives it the win. 
This in practice though can be a bit of a problem,   if you miss your double tap on the right 
earbud, you will end up raising volume instead   of pausing music. We would have much rather seen 
a swipe instead of a tap. Even so, it’s probably a   matter of getting used to and hey - if you don’t 
like you can’t disable just the single tap and   have everything else still work. Or the double 
tap. Or the long tap. SO MUCH CUSTOMIZATION!! We’ve always said that Sony has some of 
the best customisation out there - great   feature set on the app. But you can customize the 
Soundcore till your newborns grow up and go to   college. - CRAZY CUSTOMISATION! Not 
just the controls we mentioned, but for   sound! Presets? Check. 3D Audio? Check? Custom 
Hearing Profile to suit your own hearing? Check?   Full EQ Controls? Also Check. On ANC and 
transparency there’s not so much customization,   but saala who needs 20 stops 
on a noise cancelling scale! Now, SoundCore kills it by bringing another 
feature to the table that almost no other buds   do - multipoint. You can successfully connect to 
two devices simultaneously and switch between the   two. I tested this between a Samsung phone and a 
Mac and it worked well if you play one on device   and play on the second one. You will have 
to sacrifice LDAC when you do this though,   but for most people - me included - this is a 
trade off well worth it. Because this still sounds   pretty good without LDAC to our ears. You can also 
select which device you connect to within the app.   And you can use the app on any connected device 
- Android or iOS - to tweak settings on the buds   which is very cool. On the Sony, you may not get 
multiple device support but you can still switch   devices by just forcing connect from a previously 
connected device and this has worked flawlessly in   daily use. So if you don’t mind pulling up the 
bluetooth menu, it’s not as bad. But certainly   not as convenient as staying connected to 
two devices and switching on the fly. 
 
   As very superficial people, we think that the 
Sony’s have a winning design here with the noise   cancelling mic giving the XM4 a very unique 
look. The case is also tiny and very compact.   Extremely pocketable. The Liberty 3 
Pro have some things for it as well.   Even though the design is a bit bigger, they 
certainly aren’t ugly. They come with many   more colors than the Sony and they have a nice 
LED light which doubles up as a light inside   the case once you slide the case open. That 
sliding mechanism is very well designed with   a little lip you can use to push with your 
thumb, which means one handed use is doable. Coming back to the buds, the XM4s have a nice 
chonky surface to hold on to while adjusting the   buds. This makes it easier to adjust in your ear, 
since yo u don’t accidentally end up hitting the   touch surface. This was unfortunately a problem 
with the Soundcore, but as we said in the fit, we   had to adjust them far fewer times, so depending 
on your conchas, this may or may not be a problem. Comfort:
 
The Liberty 3 Pro has many silicone tips   with wing like thingy to hold it in place, whereas 
Sony put its money on the hybrid foam tips.   You know how we feel about these tips right? Good 
passive isolation, but they truly suck at comfort.   We’re silicone men here at DHRME and we Do 
Have Really Medium Ears. So the medium tips   fit my ears just fine and they were very 
comfortable for long periods of time. Both of these are gymworthy because they’re 
IPX4 sweat and water resistant but they won’t   withstand dust so don’t go mountain biking in 
a desert on these. -pause- Coming to the build,   Sony’s case is much creakier than the Soundcore’s 
which does NOT reflect the price difference. Both   come with wireless charging and advertise 8 hours 
of battery life, which is of course a guidance and   will change depending on which codec you use, 
ANC strength, volume and microphone usage.. Phone call controls aren’t great - you can answer, 
hang up and reject on the Soundcore and not   much more. And on the Sony you can switch the call 
to your phone. So the basics are in place. The   Soundcore doesn’t adjust volume while on the calls 
and the XM4s can in addition to hanging up and   accepting also switch the call to the phone with 
a long press. If you do enable volume control on   the Sony, you will be disappointed to see that the 
volume controls don’t work while on calls at all. The Soundcore comes with 6 MIC AI UPLINK 
NOISE REDUCTION and the Sony has Precise   Voice Pickup Technology with beamforming 
microphones and a bone-conduction sensor.   But you didn’t come here for a marketing pitch, 
so let’s see how they really fare shall we? Enjoy   the tests and if you just wanna proceed to the 
conclusion, use the YouTube chapter down below. The summary for us is that for quieter 
environments and for general clarity   it’s the SoundCore that's the winner. 
In noisy environments, we thought that   both pickup noise so that's kind of a wash and in   windy environments, the Soundcore is 
louder and more pleasant to listen to. Conclusion
 
While the Soundcore   Liberty 3 Pro doesn’t beat the Sony at EVERY 
SINGLE aspect, it’s very difficult for us to   seriously recommend the Sony to anyone but the 
most diehard fans. Just use the links in the   description and buy two Liberty 3 Pros instead of 
one XM4! When you can get such fantastic value,   this fight isn’t even close! In fact, it’s 
bull. We told you we’d talk about poop.
   You’ve been watching us be 
immature and we’ve been DHRME."
AirPods 3, [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here okay so i'm in the last stages of my macbook pro review a lot of you been asking where it is i'm not rushing it it is not early so sorry about that but uh my final bits of testing include editing a full mkbhd video shot in red code raw on the 16-inch m1 max macbook pro that's this video so if you're seeing this then that means at some point i got through that whole process so hopefully that went well if it didn't go well then check my twitter because that's probably where i was complaining about how things went uh either way that's next up until then these are the most popular headphones on earth these are airpods so the newest update you're looking at here is airpods 3. they were a quieter announcement at last month's apple event but they're 179 and honestly the story with these is well there's quite a bit of new stuff but also the competitive landscape for earbuds has been heating up for years and there have never been more high quality alternatives to airpods than there are right now so the new airpods 3 design basically looks just like a set of airpods pro but without the silicon tips like someone chopped them off it's a the one size fits all hard tip from the air pods of the past and this is simultaneously its biggest advantage and its biggest downside for people like me see the shape is just slightly adjusted from previous hard-tipped airpods you can see it's more of a wedge shape where it goes into your ear it's a slightly bigger opening at the end and it's a bit more of a larger bulb but basically the idea is that it's pretty close to the common ear and it just pops in and sits there no problem at least it's supposed to for most people but for me again it's not the best fit the left one happens to stay in pretty well but then the right ones constantly feeling like it's slowly sliding out of my ear and eventually it just falls out if i'm not constantly adjusting it so it's pretty annoying clearly not for me and for that reason i still prefer silicon tips instead of hard plastic i am super jealous of all you people who just grab air pods and just put them in your ears and they just stay forever and just run around um i'm not one of those people oh well but i did test these for a little bit and there are some other new things aside from just the new design so there's the controls on the stem now on both sides like airpods pro you pretty quickly get used to squeezing it to play and pause you can double tap to go to the next song etc there's no noise cancellation in these but you can see the mesh cutout on the back and around all the mics all around this thing for adaptive eq it passes through some of the sound from the outside mainly to feel a bit more open than some other earbuds they are sweat and water resistant now so if you want to work out in them you might have already done it but they'll officially be fine now and also if you walk around in the rain no problem and there's also a new horizontal case looks just like the airpods pro case but it's a little bit smaller and for the first time the case is also officially ipx4 water resistant so like they might have survived water in the past but it's officially official now still lightning at the bottom unfortunately but this new case is now improved it'll still do wireless charging but it's also now magsafe compatible which just means it'll snap onto the iphone's magsafe charging puck and it holds pretty well there too this magsafe wireless charging case isn't unique to airpods 3 though by the way they quietly also updated the airpods pro case to also snap onto the magnets but they didn't also update it for water resistance so small difference what would have been even cooler is if you could trickle charge them via the qi charging on the back of the iphone since they're both qi charging it would have been the sickest like little ecosystem plug they could have called it reverse mag safe charging but there they don't talk to each other like that it needs some extra hardware to reverse wireless charge iphones don't have that so that's not a real feature in this product like it is with some other phones and their earbuds now if you decide to grab the sexiest case on earth the dbrand icons case or pretty much any other airpods case no magnetic snapping but yes wireless charging does still work if you're wondering i'll have a link below to this case if you want to protect your headphones and make sure you get an airpods 3k specifically because like i said airpods pro cases are slightly different dimensions they won't quite fit but really the most interesting change to airpods honestly is the sound they have a and i can't believe i'm saying this a perfectly respectable sound now so it's legitimately very improved i've trashed on airpods in the past as you guys have probably remembered for how weak they sound how tiny they've been these airpods when they're sat right in your ears have much more body and bass frequencies now and they get plenty loud as always and they really do sound pretty solid now the caveat is one there is no eq built in like a lot of other headphones have and two these were meant to still be good basic everyday headphones and so apple has tuned them as such meaning they've got to be usable for phone calls and podcasts which have a lot of high focus on vocal frequencies but also music listening in a variety of genres and then also movie watching and everything in between but one feature that sort of gets highlighted at least every time apple talks about these headphones is spatial audio now i don't typically use spatial audio very much but every time i try these i give them another shot and basically there are two types of spatial audio experiences so one is if you're just listening to music or watching a video and you can just force it on with the ios settings and the head tracking turns on and for most mixes it basically sounds like you're suddenly in a small room with a set of speakers in front of you and as you turn your head from left to right those speakers will sound like they continue to stay in front of you but then two there's a very small number of really well done mixes in dolby atmos and you can find some on apple music they actually do a great job of separating the instruments and the channels and sort of spreading them out around you and this whole symphony with a decent sound stage and the airpods do a good job of letting you kind of place the instruments and vocals around you in space around your head but i find that to be a pretty rare experience if you get to listen to these listen to uh blessings by big sean that's one really good example but again these types of tracks are few and far between but ultimately the sound for me comes down to the hard tipped plastic they do sound much much better but unfortunately i have one of the cursed ears that doesn't work with hard-tipped earbuds so i would take silicon tipped earbuds every single time some people are the total other way around so there's a lot of people comparing airpods pro with airpods 3. i would personally pay the extra money for airpods pro also right now if you check on amazon airpods pro have been like 190 bucks for a while and this is the new version too with the updated case so it's like 10 extra dollars to get the noise cancellation and the silicon tips i'm picking that every single time but for some people who don't care about that type of thing this is what they'll pick but that's really the summary for these headphones they don't really do any one thing amazingly meaning they'll get beat in certain single categories but they do everything you'd want headphones to do daily very well they have a slightly longer but totally reasonable six hour battery life they have an all-around good tune that's not adjustable they have a small case that wireless charges and they fit great in the iphone's ecosystem they instantly pair with the rest of your icloud devices and seamlessly switch between them and they have better find my ability now so if you lose the case which i don't know how many people lose just the case but if you do you can use find my to track that down it's not nearly as super precise as air tags but it's very convenient to get a notification on your iphone if you start to leave somewhere and you realize you left your airpods behind but look at the whole rest of the landscape it's way more diverse and interesting now beats fit pro just came out today these have the best in-ear fit of any earbud i've ever worn wing tip for the win they're amazing for working out they have noise cancellation but they have a kind of a still clunky case that also doesn't have wireless charging or check these these are the sony wf-1000xm4 these also blow the airpods out of the water in terms of sound quality but if you've ever worn these i mean they're much bigger and don't really sit in the ear as comfortably and you wouldn't work out in these and they're 250 dollars so they're in a different price category there's also the nothing earbuds that i reviewed which have a better battery life but also a pretty big case that does wireless charge and it's a more interesting distinctive design especially with the buzz that i really like but they don't fit as well in the ios ecosystem and then there's also samsung's buds too which have a lot of the same stuff and wireless charging but you get the idea there's a lot out there so air pods are meant to sit right in the middle of the road like that's they don't do any of the things amazingly in any one category but they do everything pretty well and that's what makes them so easy to recommend it's also they came out right before the holiday season like they know i i'm probably gonna end up getting these as a gift for some people they're incredibly popular for that exact reason but here's a fun fact airpods if you just cut off airpods from apple and just made it its own separate company airpods inc that company would be worth about 175 billion dollars that's from an estimate from back in 2019 just looking at how many they're selling approaching 100 million units tons of revenue obviously but can you imagine just a headphone company by itself with only like three models being worth 175 billion dollars like just for some context logitech which makes lots of headphones but also plenty of other accessories is worth 14 billion dollars sony which makes headphones but a ton of other stuff they make movies they make the playstation they make phones and cameras sony's worth like 150 billion dollars tops right now so that's that's not to say these headphones are amazing but that's to say they are probably the best lure to bring people into the iphone ecosystem and they're all around extremely convenient they're the easy choice so there you have it thanks for watching hopefully the macbook pro isn't exploding exporting this video catch you guys soon with that review but until the next one it's techvember that doesn't roll off the tongue as well see you guys next video peace
AirPods 3,
AirPods 3, i'm predicting that this is going to be a fairly short video because when it comes to air pods 3 i don't have a lot to complain about and when i don't have a lot to complain about i don't rant nearly as much and then the length of my videos gets just cut in half in other more positive words i really like these they are a solid addition to apple's lineup and despite one small problem that we'll get into later on they are an excellent set of wireless earbuds on the outside the case for the airpods 3 looks very similar to what you'd find with the airpods pro it's slightly less wide and a little bit taller but other than that they look pretty much identical same position for the charging light same pairing button on the back and same lightning port on the bottom hidden within the airpods 3 case is a feature that airpods pro didn't originally have though magsafe compatibility up until earlier this year airpods pro had a wireless charging case but it didn't magnetically snap to magsafe accessories like the new airpods 3 case does i really don't want this to be a full video comparing the airpods 3 to the airpods pro though maybe i'll make another one later on if you guys are interested in that but i do want to draw one more comparison here the airpods 3 just looked like apple took the airpods pro chopped off these silicone ear tips and then called it a day they look very very similar to the point where i don't think you could tell the difference between someone wearing airpods 3 versus someone wearing airpods pro much more importantly though the airpods 3 are extremely comfortable like they nailed the in-ear comfort of these things i'll be the first to admit that the previous iterations of regular airpods didn't fit very well and i didn't really like them for that reason but these are much better i've spent several hours walking around with them in and they've never fallen out either they don't feel quite as secure as earbuds that actually have those silicone tips that the airpods pro have but they're definitely comfortable battery life is better this year too apple's claiming that the buds are going to give you between five and six ish hours of listening time and the case will give you another 18 or 19 hours of use since it has internal batteries i'd say that's fairly accurate it's only been about a week since i've got them so i'll have a little bit of a better picture once i use them more but battery life has been great so far to control these earbuds i have to again bring up the airpods pro they have the exact same pinch enabled control panel at the bottom of each earbud it's decent but just like airpods pro there's no way to control your volume from your earbuds unless you ask siri which is weird thankfully we do get in-ear detection on these earbuds this year if you pull an earbud out your music will stop playing until you put it back in very helpful if you're listening to loud music and you want to hear someone talking to you a little bit better speaking of which let's talk about microphone quality now the mics in these earbuds are surprisingly good and even though there's you know a little bit of that digital compression noise going on it's still a much better sound than most of mostly still much better sound than most other earbuds and that brings us to the sound quality of these earbuds now here's the thing about regular airpods i've never really been fond of how they sound and that mostly comes down to how they're designed they let sound in and out very easily and i found that the low end of most songs just didn't really carry much weight now airpods 3 don't really fix that first part there's still a very open design with very little cancellation so sounds from your environment will very easily pass through and get in the way of your music now depending on what you want to use them for that could be a pro and it could definitely be a con they also leak audio very well too if you're the kind of person that likes to play very loud music anyone standing in your immediate vicinity will be able to hear it at least a little bit as well but that second part the part about it lacking a low end that part has been improved with these airpods 3 quite a lot i actually found myself really enjoying the audio quality of airpods 3. they're way better than i remember airpods 2 being and even though i'm certainly no audiophile i think most people will be very very happy with how they sound they've added a few new features to airpods 3 that were there in airpods pro as well like spatial audio dolby atmos and adaptive eq now keep in mind that many of those features that are on the airpods 3 won't be available on an android phone though you'll get some limited spatial audio and dolby atmos support on android but worse than that is you'll be missing out on a lot of great features like seamless switching between devices uh voice assistant support notification announcements and find my tracking in fact airpods 3 are kind of a hard sell for android users i can see android users going for the airpods pro because they have an excellent active noise cancellation and pass-through mode that can be used no matter what os you're using but since most of the extra features of airpods 3 are locked behind apple's great walled garden android users get a little bit shafted but that's not really the small problem i talked about at the beginning of this video it's related but it's not what i was referring to the problem is that these new airpods 3 are priced very closely to what the airpods pro often go for i've often seen the airpods pro sell for as low as like 190 us dollars and while that isn't cheap it's only like 10 more than the 180 that these are selling for now now i'm sure airpods three will go on sale too once they've been out for a little while longer but for right now i'd actually recommend waiting to find a good deal on airpods pro unless you specifically want the airpods 3 for the fact that you don't have to stick those silicone tips in your ear the airpods 3 are a fantastic set of earbuds i just wish they'd priced them a little bit more competitively either way hope you liked the video thanks for watching and as always have a great day
AirPods 3, [Music] what's going on guys it's your average consumer and the airpods 3 are finally here this is the third generation of airpods today we're going to be going over everything you need to know what apple changed what they've added what new features it has all that good stuff but first let's talk about what you get inside of the box and this is apple guys so it's a pretty standard unboxing experience once you pop it open you'll of course be greeted by some paperwork you got your quick start guide warranty information all that stuff you're probably not going to read but once you get past that you get those airpods in hand but not so quick underneath that you've got your charging cable it's lightning to usb type-c but we're done with the boring stuff let's take a look at the airpods themselves and as you can see right off the bat this case is very very similar to that of the airpods pro they've got an almost identical design and once you pop the case open you'll see that the airpods inside almost look exactly like the airpods pro of course though there are no in-ear tips so for those of you folks who don't like to have those tips in their ears these are gonna be the experience you're looking for but now let's take a closer look at them to see if they're legit so here they are you guys the redesigned airpods this is the third generation the second generation pretty much looked exactly the same as the first uh but they had a couple of new features wireless charging case that kind of stuff but this is a completely new design they have a lot of the features that we saw with the airpods pro so if you like the idea of the airpods pro but you didn't like those little ear tips uh these are definitely for you you get a lot of those cool features that the airpods pro offer but now in a design that works better for you now what's actually different with these compared to the previous version right well first off the stem is a lot shorter now 33 shorter to be exact so they took about a third off of it and this makes it a little bit more low-key just like with the airpods pro uh so that's a good thing you don't have that long stem if you weren't a fan of it i think a lot of people got over it over time but either way it is now shorter but with this new stem since it is similar to the air pods pro you also have that force sensor so now this force sensor when you want to control your music all you have to do is give the stem a little squeeze you can squeeze it to play double tap or double squeeze to move forward a track triple tap triple squeeze to go back and you know you know the controls by now now this is a cool addition because the previous versions you had to double tap and that was like the only real option you had in terms of controls you could go into the settings and change what that double tap did but this you don't need to do all that you've got all the controls with that force sensor and of course you can activate siri by either holding down the force sensor or even just saying now let's talk about this design i'm one of those people who really relied on the airpods pro having those in-ear tips because it made it a lot easier for the airpods to stay in my ears i don't know about you guys but i was of the camp uh with the original airpods where they wouldn't sit in my ear well i've got some funky ears as you guys can see the part that of my ear that would hold the airpods in kind of goes downward whereas carl has like the perfect ear for air pods made for it as you can see his goes upward so it's got that little area right here that just it just holds it perfectly so airpods pro personally that's what i have to rely on i need to use in earbuds um but for the most part if you've got you've got those nice ears those perfect ears then you'll be all right i feel like i should hold this down because i do have the perfect gears you know carl you're a sneaky one now obviously everybody's ear shape is going to be different right but thankfully the airpods has this pretty cool feature called adaptive eq these actually have a built-in microphone that is essentially there to listen to what you're listening to so it picks up the audio the way your ears are picking up the audio and with that adaptive eq it will automatically remember that these can possibly produce did that make sense carl you get that so carl just told me that was a lot of information so basically the dummy version the average consumer version like what i'm supposed to be doing is that these will automatically hear what you're hearing and make sure you're getting the best audio quality that these can produce with me because you lost me last night you you keep me on my toes carl you keep me grounded it's getting too nerdy over here now in terms of some other cool features that you're gonna get out of these earbuds is of course spatial audio you've probably been hearing that a lot basically with spatial audio let's say you're watching content this thing is going to use the accelerometer the gyroscope all that good stuff all the tech inside of here and it's basically going to allow you to like move your head and it's basically like you're in a sound bubble audio that's coming from here will keep coming from here no matter how i turn my head so that's a pretty cool feature uh it's definitely something you guys should experience if you haven't yet it's not one of those features that's like oh gotta buy these earbuds for spatial audio but when you try it out it's pretty cool now these have a really cool feature that i want to see come to the airpods pro and that's a skin detect optical sensor what does that mean right basically you know when you take out your earbuds and your music automatically pauses but like let's say you put them in your pocket really quickly you got to go do something you'll notice that your music is playing or something is playing or you're picking up calls while it's in your pocket and you're like where's the audio going to that it sucks right well apple has done something great here and made this able to detect when it's actually touching your skin versus just being in your pocket so it uses this optical sensor to avoid getting too technical again you guys basically it's going to be able to read whether or not it's in your ear or maybe in your hands versus just like thrown in your pocket so check this out right so we've got audio playing right take it out it pauses hold it in my hand it plays skin now i throw it in my pocket still paused that's amazing you guys and that's gonna save battery as well now let's talk about the battery these have gone from a five hour rating to a six hour rating so now it will last you an hour longer and you get an extra charge basically with the case so you get a total of 30 hours instead of the 24 that we used to see which is nice always good to see better battery life these have it and five minutes of charging in the case will give you like an hour of listening time so that's always nice um one thing that's really cool about this case though is that it now supports magsafe so if you want to go ahead and just put this on a magsafe charger or something you'll be able to do that very nice and simple i hope they mag safe all the things mag save me how you forget your own you were trying to make it a thing and look at you it never happened so listen i get a lot of comments saying magazine i'm like you guys are you can't be serious but something else that's actually really cool is the earbuds are now ipx4 rated so that means you know that sweat and water resistance that kind of thing is there but so is the case we usually see it from the earbuds but not the case so now they're both offering that kind of protection which is dope so i can just accidentally drop in the sink you definitely don't want to drop it in the sink uh it's pretty much resistant to like water splashes stuff like that so if water gets on it nothing like some like not being submerged or anything like that you know we'll splash sprinkles of water you know nothing crazy but yeah now if you want to go ahead and work out with these you can officially do that but the bigger question is how do these actually sound i definitely think these are a step up compared to the previous generation apple has some custom drivers inside of here so these are brand new drivers apple redesigned the way the acoustics are in these earbuds and they actually sound pretty good it's able to produce some pretty solid bass vocals come in very clearly and they're actually able to get pretty loud they're not gonna blow out your eardrums or anything like that uh but they're pretty decent in terms of the volume that they produce i think for everyday people who are picking this up they'll be pretty happy with the audio quality that they get out of these i'll be honest with you guys me personally i'm very used to using in-ear tips and the kind of sound that that delivers with the bass and the way it all gets handled with the seal so i'm more of a fan of those so airpods pro are more of my thing but like i said i know a lot of people out there hate those kind of earbuds so this is going to be the best option for you if you're looking for air pods now what's nice about these is that they're coming in at 179 which basically replaces the second generation air pods in that price point but it's the new model then this one pretty much comes with the wireless charging case and the new earbuds so 179 for these which i think is a fair price but if you don't want that they're still the older air pods those are going to be going for 129 and of course you know the airpods pro are at 250. so this is right in the middle there uh and i think this is something that a lot of people are going to be picking up especially around the holiday season it's a wrap for these you guys i think a lot of people are gonna buy this but that about wraps it up for this video guys hopefully you got some insight into the new airpods how they perform if they might be a right fit for you let me know what you think of them down below in the comment section i'm gonna catch you guys in the next one there's probably going to be another apple video today so stay tuned for that but till the next video guys it's your average consumer peace all right carl here take it take it
AirPods 3, these are apple's third generation airpods and for the first time since the original pair back in 2016 they've got a completely new design they sound better are now water and sweat resistant and have better battery life apple's also added some new tricks like spatial audio head tracking and if you lose your airpods they're now easier to find than ever before what hasn't changed about the airpods is their seamless integration with apple's ecosystem of devices that's what has always set the airpods apart and helped apple sell an ungodly number of these things but we're near the end of 2021 and the game has changed a lot since the last airpods came around you can get a great set of earbuds for much less than 179 that apple wants for these [Music] take a quick look at the new airpods hardware and well they look like the airpods pro if you chopped off the ear tips their stems are now 33 shorter and on each earbud is the same force sensor is on the pros you can squeeze once to play or pause twice to skip to the next song or three times to go back these controls are the same on either earbud you can press and hold the sensor too to bring up siri or use hey siri for hands-free voice commands the charging case now opens in a landscape orientation again like the pros but it's smaller than the pro case and comes in pretty close to the old one just a bit thicker it's still totally pocketable and has wireless charging and while the second gen airpods supported wireless charging the newer airpods are specifically designed to work with apple's magsafe charging system magnets on the case guarantee a perfect alignment on the circular charging pad but don't expect reverse wireless charging on your fancy new iphone 13. that's still not an option and as if to drive that point home the airpods case won't stick to the back of mac safe iphones now while the design is new the 3rd gen airpods are still very much one size fits most hard plastic they rest inside your ears instead of going deep into your ear canal apple says it did a ton of research thousands of year scans heat maps even to improve their fit and comfort and at least in my case it really has made a noticeable difference i've got friends and colleagues who love the barely there fit of the previous airpods but my ears were never a great match for them they just came loose way too easily these new buds are still super lightweight and comfortable but something about the contours feels more secure and i don't have that same constant anxiety with them just falling out and down a sewer grate or something i do still prefer regular earbuds with tips over this open style that lets in so much outside noise but i can finally say now that airpods fit my ears if you've had trouble with the older design it's worth trying this new one for sure as for how they sound apple says the new airpods have custom drivers and amplifiers and they also have the same adaptive eq feature as the airpods pro and airpods max each earbud has an inward facing mic that analyzes what you're hearing and tunes in real time so apple claims the low and mid frequencies based on the shape of your specific ears for the best sound the thing is though it's hard to know what difference adaptive eq is actually making how are you supposed to tell what it's doing i'd say if there's one area it does seem to be helping its base the third gen airpods sound fuller and have more body than the original and second gen models did it's about the best you can expect from these open style earbuds but it still won't match the deeper low end of buds that fully seal into your ears the airpods are clearly tuned to sound pleasing across a wide span of content music podcasts movies tv and games and they continue to excel at that now i'm not talking about some big upgrade and sound quality here these still sound like airpods but maybe with a little extra something that wasn't quite there before but that brings us to one of the big features that apple's pushing with these new airpods and that's spatial audio spatial audio is supposed to provide a more immersive experience than stereo by placing sounds anywhere and everywhere in space it's all meant to sound more multi-dimensional or at least that's what they say there are already thousands of songs on apple music that have these dolby atmos spatial audio mixes and you can find the same kind of thing on title and amazon music but apple is pushing this new way of hearing your favorite songs hard and this isn't just for music some of the biggest video apps like netflix hbo max amazon prime video and others also support spatial audio listening but what makes apple's approach special is head tracking like the airpods pro and max now the third gen airpods can adjust the audio in each earbud as you turn your head from side to side keeping the sound stage fixed in place in front of you watching movies is where this effect is most impressive on my big ipad pro or at home on my apple tv it makes for a really cool surround sound experience that pulls you in more than any stereo mix ever would but music is where things get a lot more inconsistent frankly i could live without spatial audio and apple music or anywhere else for that matter right now see regardless of whether you've got head tracking on or off many of these dolby atmos music tracks sound objectively worse than their stereo counterparts instruments and effects sound out of place vocals can get drowned out in the mix and so on point being that it takes a lot of effort from artists and producers to make this format really shine and so far it's very obvious that most of these mixes are not getting that level of work it's easy to switch back and forth between atmos and regular stereos in control center on ios which is great and sometimes it is fun to hear how your favorite songs come through in spatial audio but on the whole this concept just is not a reason to buy these airpods spatial audio can definitely wow you when watching movies but is very very meh for music these new airpods have longer battery life up to 6 hours of straight listening from the previous 5 and a total of 30 hours when you include the charging case both the earbuds and case are now rated ipx4 for water resistance so they're much better suited for use at the gym or on a run airpods have always been the best earbuds for voice calls so we had to put these through a thorough mic test apple says it's using a new codec for a better voice quality on facetime and the outer mesh on each earbud should do a better job reducing wind noise so then let's hear how these things sound what do you think so far becca what up chris today we are putting head to head a bunch of open earbuds look at all look at look at all the first up is the classic og first gen air pods next up we have the one plus buds which are incredibly colorful they came out in july 2020 also open ear and they run for around 60 bucks now and of course the headphone of the hour these are the third gen air pods their stem is a bit shorter this year so i don't know how this mic quality is going to be and now we have the open ear offerings from samsung these are the galaxy buds live also known as the beans okay now i want to throw in a wired pair of apple headphones just because this mic always sounds so damn good and before we had wireless well we had these let's go to medium oh boy all right we're back i like the fantast the best because most the time people can't hear me because there's a lot of wind happening on the earbuds i always did love the color options of the oneplus buds i mean there's very few bugs you can get in this color ah man sometimes i get really worried about doing the wind test because i know that it drives my hair into a particular direction and i don't always love but uh anything for you buds you know what i love about the beans is that their design is like super unique and it fits so well in my ears even with this like annoying piercing that kind of gets in the way of so many other buds man i remember using these headphones and just like running the cable up my shirt always to try to hide it or keep it out of the way i'm so happy i don't have to do that anymore wow competition is getting stiff in the mic department it is good to know that the third gens sound just as good as the first gen air pods and nothing nothing can beat the wired headphones still i mean the mic is like right here so of course not but anyway back to you welch rounding out the 3rd gen airpods are some new software tricks they've now got full integration with apple's find my app and there's a new air tags like interface for hunting them down if they're somewhere close by but it's not quite as precise what's more helpful at least i think is that you can now be notified if you leave your airpods behind somewhere which is awesome and if they're still truly nowhere to be found you can turn on lost mode and be alerted if they come in range of millions of other ios devices one last kind of neat thing i want to mention has to do with your skin see airpods have always paused automatically if you take one out of your ears but these new ones have a more advanced skin detection sensor that apple claims can tell the difference between your ears and something like your pants pocket so if you shove them in there without the case on they won't play music anymore or as they might have before with their all new design sweat resistance longer battery life and new software features apple's third gen airpods are easy to recommend over the previous pair personally i'd lean towards the airpods pro for their active noise cancellation and ear tips but if you love that original airpod design that open style and you're ready for an upgrade here it is and the main reason for buying them is still that unmatched simplicity and convenience for people who live inside apple's ecosystem the one step setup automatic device switching audio sharing and so on but having said all of that before you get locked further into apple's world it's worth giving other earbuds a serious look there are so many more options now than there were even a few years ago when the second gen earpods came out i'm talking about earbuds from samsung and jabra and sennheiser and amazon and sony and nothing and anchor and any number of companies in some cases they definitely sound better or have features that the airpods don't the question is if you want the easy thing just like every other pair of airpods these are meant to be the perfect companion to your iphone and perhaps more than any other apple product nowadays airpods still just work this is walking up the middle of the street you own this city
AirPods 3," - I wouldn't really describe
myself as a fan of anything, but I love my AirPod Pros. They sound fine. The active noise
cancellation is excellent, without any kind of weird
pressure on my ears, and they are among the most
comfortable-in-ear headphones that I have ever used. So, when I saw Apple's
third gen regular AirPods, which bring that AirPods pro
shape to a lower price point, all be it without active
noise cancellation, I was pretty excited. And this is my first hands-on, brand new, there you go, we're tearing off the seals. AirPods with MagSafe charging case, okay. For headphones, I actually see MagSafe as having more value for me personally, than it does for a phone. I don't have a tonne of
difficulty lining up my phone on a regular charging pad. But every once in a while,
I do miss with these, just because they're so small compared to the normal
shape of a charging pad. That I could see that
being extremely useful. AirPods. Thanks. Don't bother telling me
what generation I bought, or anything like that, who cares, right? Still resentful of their naming schemes. Now is this smaller? It's smaller. I've sequestered myself, actually, Anthony did all our coverage of the event, so all I saw was that it's
the AirPods Pro shape, but you don't have to
pay quite so much for it. They are a lot smaller. Wow. They're basically the size of
the old AirPods carrying case, except it opens up
horizontally now, instead of, instead of vertically. Actually here, I'm just
going to pull this out. That is like, is that, is
it exactly the same size? Boy, is it ever close? Wow, hold on. I think it might be a little thicker. If it's thicker, it's
marginal, it's really close, which means then that it's
going to fit perfectly in your headphone pocket. Boom, just like that. Oh man, that goes into real easy. That is one of the biggest advantages that Apple has over their competition because there's tonnes of
other earphones out there that have four-ish hour battery life in the earphones themselves and then offer another
20 something in the case. But where Apple really stands out, is that they do it in a
case that is way smaller. And now they do it in an earphone that is really, really aggressively sized. To be clear, the new third gen AirPods have six hours of battery life, which is even more impressive
given the size of the case. Now, one thing that I can tell you guys, that I'm going to miss immediately, is you can see that the silicone
tip from the AirPods Pros is not present on the new AirPods. One nice thing about this, is
it means that after six months you won't be being shamed
actively into buying a new pair, because your ear tips, which
are white for some reason, turn yellow. There, that's a little
less unpleasant looking, right Brendan. Now, interestingly, these are not really quite the same shape. - [Brendan] Wouldn't you be more concerned with the AirPods gen three
clogging up with wax? - No, that's a really big grill. All you're going to need is
a little bit of moisture, like an isopropyl alcohol. Get it kind of softened up a little bit, you should be able to
pretty much wipe that out. I mean, the deeper it goes in your ear, the more wax buildup is
going to be a problem. I know that some people in
particular do have trouble with their AirPods clogging up with wax, but I'd say that they've actually done a better than usual job of
making it cleanable here. Obviously, if it disassembles in any way, that was helpful for
those kinds of things, it would be better,
but never change Apple. Oh, is there anything else included? Yes. You get a USBC to lightening cable. So wireless charging sold separately. Okay, what I'm really
interested in is the ergonomics, cause that's my favorite
thing about the AirPods Pros. LG's latest tone freeze, the FP eights, are actually very, very
close in terms of comfort, but these are really, really good. I just want to put my regular
Pros in for a sec here. My daily drivers. Okay. Basically perfect. They're impossible to remove from my ears without putting my fingers
in to take them out. I actually sleep with them
in almost every night. I turn on the active noise cancellation, just kind of helps me sleep
through random noises. I absolutely love these things. Let's see how much you're giving up, for what is it, 70 bucks? That's the difference in price, I think. Hmm. They're not going to come out, but you're also not going
to have that snugness that you get from a silicone ear tip. My biggest takeaway just
from putting them in my ears, haven't even listened to anything yet, my biggest takeaway from them
right out of the gate is, Apple, please don't
discontinue the Pro line. Not everyone likes that in ear canal, sort of violated feeling though
so, your mileage may vary. But the other thing you're not
getting compared to the Pros, is you're not getting any kind
of passive noise isolation, which is not the same as cancellation. So the Pros have both. They isolate well, because they've got this
nice seal with your ear. But, they also actively noise
cancel using the microphones that are on the outside of the earphone. These have neither, there's
no active noise cancellation, and because they don't
form a seal with your ear, I can hear every bit as well right now. maybe slightly less well, but almost as well as if I
didn't have them in at all. But no, I don't want to find contacts. Just not now. I'm trying to listen to music you idiots. Why's every music app wanna
know everything about you. Well, I mean, we all know
the answer, but stop. Oh my God. I have to put
iOS 15 on this iPhone. While we wait, it's time for
message from our sponsor. - [Brendan] Hey-ya. - Hey-ya indeed. Instructions, dip the toothpick,
dab it on your tongue. Read the sponsor spot. Don't be a B word. Flatline hot sauce. If you're not familiar with D-Brand, they make expensive electronics tape that you can wrap your devices with. This is from a drop we
did with them awhile back, their sticker bomb skin. Message them and ask them for it. I know they've got, they've
got lots of this still. It wasn't limited edition at all. And they also make a habit of trolling me in their sponsor spots, that they must sell a
lot of electronics tape in order to pay for it
because they're not cheap. Pepper palace the end. I just
want to know what's in it. Oh, Reaper's okay. Oliorism, capsism, capsism? I think I've heard of those before. I think those are bad things. All right, well good luck everybody. (man choking) (man laughing) - [Brendan] Oh no! - D-Brand if I end up with hiccups for the entire rest of this video, I'm going to be pretty pissed off. That's it, D-Brand, you don't get any more
talking points than that. Don't like it, complain to your reps boss. Oh wait, he don't care. The cold water is so soothing. LTTstore.com, baby. Updates done. We're ready. I'm expecting a super simple
pairing process, connect. Press once to play, pause,
twice to skip forward, three times just to backwards. Here we go. Oh, interesting. Okay, I was not expecting them to make a noise when I put them in my ears because that's usually the indicator for whether you're turning ANC on and off. Okay. Holding just gives you Siri. Oh shut up, Siri. I do strongly prefer
the squeezed style stems compared to the tap in
the old regular AirPods. This is way better. It's way harder to accidentally actuate and it's way easier to hit on purpose. Got the same little tic noise
to confirm that it registered. Now how do I control
whether spatial audio is on? I can tell that it's
probably on right now. That seems like a weird
thing for them to have on by default though. The fact that there's
so many hits for this tells you everything you need to know. Settings, Bluetooth. Thank you for not bringing
that up when I searched for it. There we go. You can turn it on in control center. So I can't turn it on here? It doesn't do anything, see? This is just to hear the
difference. Okay, it was on. So that explains why it had
that huge kind of sound to it. Let's turn it off and see how they sound without any weird digital tricks. I could see people liking it in the same way that
there's a lot of people that do like DSP effects, you know, like to give them more auditorium
like sound to what they're listening to or whatever else. Personally, I strongly
prefer to listen to music as the artist intended
it without any effects. That's not my vibe here. I'd also probably never
use that head track mode. Now that's interesting. Apple is doing more than
just adding a DSP effect here that gives it spatiality. They're also playing around
with EQ as far as I can tell. And in much the same
way that modern laptops, if you listen to their speakers
with the drivers installed, they sound horrible. Manufacturers are adding a
lot of software compensation for the drivers that
make them sound better. I think Apple is actually
tuning the sound, as well as adding that openness to it. - [Brendan] Yeah the big thing is they have an adaptive EQ on these ones. - Sorry, adaptive EQ?
Where do you adjust that? There appears to be just
running all the time. That's a really interesting move because I think a lot of people are going to turn on the spatial audio and they're going to be like, wow, how did they ever listen
to music before this? But a big part of the effect
is coming from something that doesn't have to do
with that spatial effect. I wonder why? Well, I guess I don't really wonder why, I guess it's a way to have people hooked on the Apple ecosystem. Because to my knowledge, these
features won't be supported if you pair it to an Android device. Like I do. I actually daily drive these
with an Android device. All right. Let's move on though. How do they sound compared
to the AirPods Pro? Because I think that's the decision a lot of people are going to be making. Especially with how much
more expensive the gen three AirPods are compared to gen twos. Interesting. So my option for spatial audio goes away when I'm sharing my audio. It's really hard to compare. It's like comparing an
open backed headphone with a closed back headphone. They have very different flavors. Another thing that makes this challenging is these are my daily drivers. I listen to them every single day. So inherently there's a
bit of bias towards them because your ears tend to like
what they often listen to. I, other than the lack of noise isolation and noise cancellation, I
can't find a problem with them compared to the AirPods Pros. I'd say they are on par. To be clear, neither of these
are audio file grade IEM's. If you wanted those, you could expect them
to have a wire on them, but they both sound good enough. And if your main concern is not tuning out the world around you, man, these are huge step
forward compared to last gen. In terms of comfort, in
terms of sound. Yeah. What can I say? Good product. - [Brendan] Do you Want to
test the microphone though? Oh, the mic. Is the mic
supposed to be worse? Oh, I mean, yeah, we can do a
quick, we can do a quick call. What's up Mr. Ten? How's my, how's my audio
quality doing over there? I would have you test
my AirPods Pros as well, but I have a slight
problem with the microphone on my AirPods Pros because I
ran over this one in my car. (man grunts) (man laughs) Microphone is a little
bit, it used to be good. - [Brendan] It used to be good. Well, we can't really
fault apple for that one. (Brendan laughs) - Just like my videos used to be good back when I was in the
kitchen, Linus sucks now. But if you disagree with that statement, go ahead and subscribe."
AirPods 3, we're talking about apple products though and this came open right away oh yeah it's a better fit than the regular airpods for my ears check the look sick not the strongest connection which might be the sweet spot i don't know oh we have volume it's really weird that it's there's a lot of cross over here who who who said they're almost the same we have some air pods today the new airpods that's the confusing part isn't it airpods third generation not pro they still have the pro they still have the second generation these are the third generation a slight improvement over the second generation but you're gonna pay more money i have the canadian price on this particular package 239 dollars so it's still a premium price who's it for it's for somebody who wants some of the pro features without an ear tip style design this also has the magsafe charging case which i think is a pretty cool improvement for convenience and such so this can just snap onto apple's magnetic magsafe there's a thing going on with the word magsafe and how it applies to the variety of magnetic apple products because there's like iphone magsafe and then there's the new mag safe charger which is really kind of like the old magsafe charger for the laptops anyway point being is you can magnetically charge these which is a nice touch as well oh also i have new uh later case just like this one airpods third generation 100 dupont kevlar same fit as this one so you can pick that up order that up if you're going to be getting the third generation airpods and another quick preview before i jump into the box i got the new g-shock watch smartwatch android wear i haven't worn a g-shock in a long time but if you've been around the channel you know i used to love these things wear os by google plus casio g-shock rugged and stuff gsw h1000 made in japan so that's a bonus round after we do the airpods now the shape of it they change so even though it's not interchangeable ear tips it is a sort of a more bulbous looking shape to it still has your toothbrush stem looking situation however the stem is a little bit shorter on this one as well easy unboxing experience you know how this goes zip and zip also come with spatial audio so airpods 3 are going to have the spatial audio feature from the airpods pro standard airpods never had it however active noise cancellation continues to be the biggest difference that's going to be exclusive to the pricier model with the pro designation you've been using the airpods pro recently any thoughts on that i love them oh my god the noise cancellation is amazing noise cancellation he says amazing he's trying to get mo out of his life at least the noise that mo is making which is frequent and constant maybe the dog moe's not that loud himself a little bit of paperwork inside the package touch controls obviously on the side of the stem play pause skip tracks and siri if you'd like to use it the case is a little bit larger than regular airpods as you can see but not quite as large as the pro model that's interesting we peel this and this came open right away still going to have your lightning connector on the bottom for charging it up you're still going to have your led on the front it's all very familiar look at the two-tone black and white look pull out the pro bud and pull out the third generation bud they're so comparable in appearance that's crazy it's almost like the new third generation bud is simply missing the nozzle and that's it if i pull off the little adapter in-ear adapter look how similar those look the pro model versus the third generation although the speaker portion the port is larger on the pro model still and actually the entire earbud is larger on the pro model still let's try this on let's get an idea of some comfort here right left now one benefit of not having a nozzle like this is you have a fit that's a i don't know what to call it more of a casual fit if you're going for the opposite end of the spectrum from noise cancelling maybe more towards transparency then this is just naturally more transparent because it's not sitting in my ear canal so i can even hear myself speaking i never had trouble with the original air pods and the fit there but some people say it falls out of their ears you were complaining about that in the past i don't think anything's really going to compete with the pro model for fit because it's in the ear canal oh yeah it's a better fit than the regular airpods for my ears yeah this this is this is loose this is more loose it's a smaller it's a way smaller earbud where's the charge pad the apple charge all right well well moe goes to get the uh the magsafe charger so we can look at the connection of this thing also in the package you have a typical traditional cable option on this end it's still going to be lightning now as far as the case is concerned let's see how that fits on well no adhesive necessary it's a friction fit so that just goes bang like that and you still have access to the button and bingo check the look sick okay so we have the apple official magsafe charger this is just going to stick when it gets there you see the orange light comes on it's charging it's not the strongest connection but it doesn't really have to be because you're not really going to be using the case while it's on there not like the phones which have to make a sort of stronger grasp because you're going to be using the phone and yes it does work as well with the case on it still sticks oh and charges i also think with this new design they're going to get a little bit less disgusting i don't know why that is but like with the earwax and stuff the in-ear is going to be the worst for that these were kind of bad for that because they had a really small nozzle as well this one with the like bigger opening i think it's going to be easier to clean it out and get the debris out of there that's just a little side thing all right so there's an update preparing here ios 15.1 all right we're back it is uh another day because this one we left it updating it was like the world's longest update for some reason 15.1 prores i blame prores anyway it doesn't matter because we're back and that's the main thing and now we are finally gonna get to listen to the third generation of air pods which might be the sweet spot i don't know if it's in between these two and so you save a little bit of money on this one you pay a little more than this one how are they gonna sound i'm gonna compare i'm gonna listen to these and then the pros can they replace the pros should you get them instead of the pros do you need noise cancellation all right so right away of course we get our wonderful air airpod connection prompt i am connected now i just gotta be honest with you it is almost no isolation i have music playing piano music somehow right away where is this music coming from that's my apple music oh it's your apple music i was like what is going on here it's funny when you're marketing spatial audio i never imagined there's also i mean you end up with the the activity of spatializing i've already demonstrated spatial audio with the pro models it is magical i it sounds stupid it sounds so stupid it feels like i'm a i don't know how the software oh that's a switch we're in kirk's library right now they sound better than these little earpods it's it's there's a thickness there's a thickness to it sound better than those oh this is a banging album you're going to love this album it's a comfortable uh earbud it's a day to day it's an everyday i don't know about lone star rag but definitely when we had the drake on there okay fine wow this is my like 2016 in a bottle right here lots of volume too hey with like the ear health care turned off oh we have volume i like having more volume than i need and then just like allow me to you know i mean like as far as the volume is concerned i need to be able to manage these things somehow there's just like a little bit of uh punch lacking just a tiny touch uh maybe i should just do an a b test right now same track no they're not even close to as good as the pros no not even close people are saying people are saying what they're pretty close people are saying what i don't know who you're talking to i don't know who you've been chatting with i got buds flying over here flying buds but here's the thing all right all right let me just if you don't mind let me just uh give you my take here i have no idea why you would buy uh unless you absolutely hate having things in your ear sit deeply in your ear if the ear tip in the ear canal drives you nuts that's the one reason i think you should look at the airpods third generation that's pretty much it because these are better have more features and they're not that much more money if you're already close to two bills on the earbuds i guess the wireless charging is a nice little touch i don't know what kind of value that brings for you but uh you're so close to picking up these or uh finding them for slightly less on a discount or something i guess the case is a little bit smaller get the pro that's it it's easy that's easy get the pro yep i'm sold i'm resold if this is what you're considering these are your options get the pro yeah i mean they're fine i mean they're fine get the pro skip these ones get the pro which one should i get i think you might you know what i gave it some more thought here i think maybe go for the pro i'm guessing that apple still sells a lot of these and people are intimidated like that there must be a reason why they feel like this this product needs to exist in the middle of these two maybe this thing's on the way out they're going to hang on to it for just a short period of time maybe the holiday season whatever one more generation because they have an abundance of inventory or it's easier to make right now because of shortages or shipping or covet or whatever i don't think this design is necessarily going to be there forever things i just feel this product makes more sense when you don't also have this one as an option because they're so similar that's all it's home get the pro skip these ones get the pro i don't know if you guys noticed kanye he shaved his eyebrows he's been wearing these around well moe wants a later case shout out yeah that might be one of my favorite later case products the way those fit on the airpods max get the pro let's check out this new watch how about that uh a g-shock that has wear os it can work in uh like a light power consumption mode as a pretty typical g-shock which i like sometimes i don't want smart features don't need heart rate and i don't want to drain battery so you can go for much longer periods of time when you're in sort of dumb mode and then flip into smart mode when i don't know you need to track heart rate or something like that and i typically don't want notifications on my wrist so that's a cool compromise or that's a cool hybrid type of setup they're so rugged you slam it into something and you don't you're not concerned anyway built into this one shock resistant heart rate gps altimeter barometer compass and also some water resistance as well as you would expect in a rugged watch like this i love the old school japanese digital watch unboxing experience i can imagine somebody thinking good lord that's a that's too much i can't have that on my wrist all day but i don't mind or at least i didn't in the past g shock feelings look at the strap it clicks along there through there you have a double clasp you see the heart rate sensor on the bottom yeah so look at these little wrist supports as well because it is so large huge tactile buttons you get this it's almost like magsafe sort of that little pin portion and what happens yeah it's magnetic lovely and that's it it has some minor blue accents like on the start button over here and also you can see through the wristband so that's your look i'm telling you it's not going to be for everybody but so rugged you know but if you're into it at all if you're the rugged type or you just appreciate having ruggedness then this is kind of a cool merging of the worlds of the watch worlds couldn't be more different than the watch kirk's currently wearing that is a the fanciest of fancy apple watches gold-plated right that's from caviar now it's obvious why apple took the approach they took but i'm glad that other options exist look how cool the g-shock logo is just so classic i'm gonna set it up with my uh pixel 6 pro and wear os and if you want to know more about my experience with this watch i'll probably chat about it on the next episode of lou

Jabra Elite 7 Pro, jabra claims to have reinvented true wireless earbuds with their new flagship the jabra elite 7 pro but with so many incredible earbuds selling for less than 100 adding wireless charging or anc is is no longer enough to stand out in a sea of wireless earbuds so what did jabra actually do to make these earbuds so much better well they did a couple things let's get into it hey everyone welcome back to the channel i'm mike o'brien and like i said this is the jabra elite 7 pro a pair of earbuds that have been much anticipated by anybody following earbuds and i mean i personally have been really excited about these since they were announced and more importantly since i reviewed the jabra elite threes but before i explain what the difference is here let's kind of take a little rewind and talk about a brief timeline of jabra earbuds so two years ago jobber came out with the elite 75 t's in my opinion these were arguably the best jobber earbuds that they ever made at least until now but that was because they had fantastic bass they had a great battery life a great fit very very comfortable and for a long time they were one of my favorites on this channel in the earbud reviews and my comparison videos they usually came up on top or at least very near the top and then last year so one year after the 75 teas jabra came out with the 85 ts and the jobber 85ts i thought kind of took a step back so while they were better in that they added powerful active noise cancellation and they added a qi wireless charging on the case they took a step back because something i really liked about jabra was that compact form factor the small case the long battery life like fitting everything into something so small i thought was really important and the 85 ts added a lot of ball and then a couple weeks ago jabber came out with the elite threes and since i reviewed them on this channel which i'll link to that down below i actually really love these earbuds fantastic case very similar design to what we saw on the 75 tees and since i made that video i've actually worn these on every single run i've gone on which is several times a week that's because i find that they're lighter and more secure and and overall i just feel like they're better for workouts than most other earbuds on the market but now we have the jabber elite pro 7 which i'm more than confident is definitely going to take the place of the jabber elite 3s at least for my workouts i really like these earbuds and let's start off with a physical tour to see what they're actually good at now you can see the case design is a little bit different and at first i was skeptical of this because one of the things i really loved about the jabra elite 3s and the 75ts was the compact case i thought it was a fantastic design the way it opened it was small it fit well in your pockets and everything about it just made a lot of sense but now they went with a more clamshell design more similar to what we saw with the galaxy buds which is another case design that i definitely do like of course with this new case design you are getting a bigger surface on the bottom for qi wireless charging which i think is a positive and you do have some fast charging options where you can charge it for five minutes and get one hour of listening but when you open up the case by far one of the best features of these earbuds is that incredibly small compact size and shape so these earbuds fit incredibly comfortably in my ears much like the jabra elite 75ts actually even better than those honestly and they're more secure than the 85ts i found that these earbuds not only feel incredibly light when you're working out they don't feel like there's too much in my ears not a lot of pressure build up and being that they're so small and compact you would expect all right maybe they compromised on sound quality maybe they compromised on the battery life they actually didn't either just as a side note i have a lot of other earbuds on my desk right now so if you want to see those videos coming out very soon be sure to go down and click that subscribe button and the bell icon so you don't miss those videos so as i mentioned one of the aspects of jabra earbuds i've always been really fond of is how flush they are in your ears so when you wear them they never look like they stick out too far they're never too bulky and now these being even smaller are even more subtle so whether you're wearing them for video meetings or whether you're wearing them on a bus or in public or any other situation a subtle light pair of earbuds i think looks a lot nicer and speaking of looks they also come in three different colors so these are the black and gray ones obviously there's also an all-black version and an all tan version so i mean honestly you can choose whichever one looks the most subtle to you something strange i noticed with these earbuds is when i take them out of my ears because the silicone tip is so soft a lot of times it turns inside out and looking on the outside you'll see another thing i've always really liked about these earbuds being the really perfectly tactile physical buttons so unlike a lot of earbuds that have touch controls the physical buttons i think perform better when you are outside and you're wearing gloves or if your hands are wet or literally any other situation where you want to use a button instead of a physical touch control i think there's more situations than not where touch controls just end up not working as well as you want them to so physical buttons are fantastic i'm happy to see that on here and looking on the inside of the earbuds you'll see we have our charging nodes we have our tiny little proximity sensor these do actually have auto play and auto paws when you put them in or take them out of your ears i think that's a great thing to have and they have microphones that are really hard to see on these earbuds but we'll get into a microphone test in just a second to see how good that actually is because again when you go on their website that was one of the massive claims they made they've been talking all about their improved hear through their improved microphones and everything along those lines so really summarizing the physical design i think it's smaller it's more compact they still have physical buttons the physical buttons feel great and now they have ip57 water resistance and dust resistance as well meaning that these are really durable so physical design has always been something jabber really did well and i think that's a great thing that i commend them for but the the microphones have never really been leading the pack so the fact that they're claiming that these are leading the pack makes me really interested in trying them out so let's actually get into a test right now and see how the microphones actually sound okay so getting into a microphone test this is what it sounds like indoors in a studio environment with the jabra elite 7 pro so you can leave a comment and let me know how these sound to you but of course you're not always going to be indoors in a quiet environment sometimes you're going to be outside on a sidewalk or near some noisy traffic so let's go in a louder environment and see how they perform there all right so now we're outside by a pretty busy road a lot of ambience out here so leave a comment and let me know if you can hear what i'm saying in a noisier environment now with such a compact design you might assume that jabra compromised on the sound quality or the battery life and that's actually not the case i found that these earbuds have a pretty fantastic battery life but depending on where you look you find different numbers like jobber's website said 8 hours or 30 hours with the case but on the box it says you get 9 hours with the earbuds and 35 hours with the case regardless of what it is it's a fantastic battery life and it should definitely get you through a pretty long time listening to these and another benefit is if for some reason you wanted to extend that battery life or if you just want to do this for any other reason you can listen to just one earbud at a time so these do have mono mode again something that in the past jobber earbuds have kind of struggled with so that's because they're now using bluetooth 5.2 which is huge positive but that kind of leads into one of the first drawbacks unlike a lot of the previous java earbuds at least at launch these don't have any kind of multi-pairing so i cannot connect to two devices at once as i used to be able to with the 75 ts and the 85 t's instead at least right now i'm only only able to connect to one device at a time with the jabra elite 7 pros and speaking of the connectivity and the features of these earbuds let's take a look at the app the jobber sound app has a lot in there and it always gets a little better with every generation so right here you can see the jabra elite 7 pros has a lot of things here we can have different levels of active noise cancellation which i'll talk more about that in a second we also have hear through mode which has many different levels of that as well and from my experience the hear through is really clean with this that was one of the things they bragged about when they launched these earbuds and kind of rightfully so i think it sounds really clean and really crisp with almost no delay at all so it sounds like you're not even wearing them that's something that i was really happy to see we also have an equalizer down here with several different ways you can eq this the energize is pretty exciting and of course i'll talk more about sound in a second but realistically like they have a lot of capabilities i found that when you adjust the eq you can really max out each one and or minimize each one and you don't have a lot of distortion and then of course they have their soundscape as well on the bottom which is something that jobber has always had it's just white noise something to sleep with and since these are so much smaller than a lot of other earbuds i could definitely see people sleeping with these and playing some white noise in the app i also love that you're able to customize the controls now i mentioned that the sound quality with these earbuds was pretty substantial despite being in such a tiny form factor they didn't really compromise much but there was one thing that i wish they had and that is higher quality codecs these are limited to spc and aac which if you have an iphone is all you're able to do anyway but regardless they seem to sound really good they have a very powerful bass that doesn't really lose balance no matter how you eq this and i found that you know even if you want to eq and max out the bass or totally minimize the bass you really don't have much distortion and even when you max it out it doesn't sound too muddy overall i think they did a really good job presenting the balance in a very capable pair of earbuds and the only complaints i had of course being that you don't have the higher quality codecs these are not the most analytical pair of earbuds out there and they are very slightly sibilant but otherwise they're very fun and lively sound i find that for most people anyone who's not an audiophile you're going to absolutely love the sound of these earbuds like i said powerful bass very capable and they seem to sound really balanced in just about every genre i've tried to listen to but the active noise cancellation on these earbuds is unfortunately not quite as impressive as the sound quality or the form factor or anything else about these earbuds i found that while the asc definitely does a decent job blocking stuff out it's nowhere near the level of the sony earbuds or even the airpods pro so for anc they do the job well enough but they're not going to be anything too substantial but that's been it that's my take on the jabra elite 7 pros overall they're a pretty fantastic pair of earbuds but do they justify the price difference between these at 199 versus the jabber elite threes which are less than half the price honestly i would say that for most people if you're on a tight budget it's going to be a no-brainer to go with the cheaper pair of earbuds that still give you the benefit of having a job or pair of earbuds being a very comfortable very compact pair but for anybody who is not tight on money and you want a more compact pair that is very slim looks really nice very clean with great controls great sound and great microphones i mean the jabra elite seven pros are really a no-brainer but keep in mind like i said the active noise cancellation is going to be your one compromise you don't have the most powerful anc but you're getting a smaller pair of earbuds so let me know what you think would you prefer the sony xm4s with their larger form factor but with that get better active noise cancellation or something smaller like the jabras right here which give you not as great active noise cancellation but just about everything else in a really compact design i want to hear from you guys in the comments below as always if you enjoyed this video consider liking and subscribing i'm michael bryan thanks for watching and i'll see you next time [Music]

Jabra Elite 7 Pro, hey everyone today we're going to be revisiting the Jabra Elite 7 Pro they've been out for just over a year now and maybe you're deciding between the Elite Four from Jabra or you may have had the old pair the 75t which I still use today because they were ahead of their time and I gotta say the elite 7 Pro are also ahead of their time they're still one of the best you can get at their price because these go on sale the lowest I've seen them is 99 U.S and at that price the value you get is ridiculous these buds have also been updated quite a bit since their release so we're going to cover everything today but starting with how the buds fit and I don't know what it is about Jabra earbuds they just work for me really well the 75t were one of the best overall fitting earbuds they have the best security that I've ever tested and the comfort is not the best because the 75t had a lot of suction and pressure in the ear canal which I personally didn't mind I use them when training but the elite 7 Pro here Jabra fix that problem they still have a bit of suction and pressure but nowhere near as much as a 75t but this is basically the kind of Bot I can chuck in my ears even training doesn't matter what I'm doing lying down for bench press and leaning over for rows are always an exercise where the buds start to move out of place the 7 Pro staying completely fine when running though the only issue with having a bit of suction in the ear canal is that there is quite a bit of body born noise when running from the impact that you make on the ground so this will affect the sound quality especially bass Heavy Music basically for me not a pair that I use when running now compared to the Elite Four it's basically the exact same fit and if you want to grab one of the active pairs I've got the Elite Four active and the 7 Pro the only difference is the coating on the outside which at least for my ears it doesn't do anything it doesn't actually rest on your ear canal or anything like that so no point getting the active really really depends on what the prices are at I know the microphones are slightly different on the 7 Pro and the Seven active but all the pairs have an ip57 dust and waterproof rating this is very rare the five stands for dust proofing so find if you get sand and dust in it the seven is actually waterproof so you could submerge the buds in water preferably accidentally you wouldn't want to go deep diving in these but completely fine if you accidentally fall into a lake or something I don't know what you're doing now in terms of battery life Jabra have industry-leading results here because with noise canceling on you're getting eight hours from the earbuds and 30 hours in total with the case Chuck the buds in the case for five minutes you get an hour's playback the case is compatible with wireless charging now moving on to the case itself Jabra has some of the best build quality nice feeling plastic it just feels nice to touch the case it isn't the slimmest case so this is what it looks like compared to the airpods pro case for a little bit of reference still pretty easily pocketable and you just get one LED indicator on the front of the case so you know when to charge your case up now in terms of controls really great stuff here from java you have control of everything your play pause your skip tracks your noise canceling on and off as well as volume up and down you also get some great customization in the app you can customize everything except for the volume up and down control so really nice Freedom there a couple of issues though is that since these use a physical button which is great if that's what you're looking for it does require a bit of a press into the ear canal to work properly so an easy fix for me instead of pressing just straight in I kind of just push the earbud up slightly and then press so it doesn't dig into my ear canal which was a little bit strange a 75 t button was actually a little bit easy to press and these buds also have any detection for auto pausing and playing your music when you take the buds out of your ears I ran it through my pocket test where I take one butt out Chuck it in my pocket and just live my life normally from training or whatever and my music would start to resume when the bug was in my pocket you also get some more customization in the app you can even customize if you want to have the voice command to let you know what's going on or just have a beep we're on the Elite Four you only get the beeping sounds You Can't customize it as much and you don't get any control customization and the Elite 4 also uses a physical button and it's actually much harder to press in but you can do the same thing and that's the same work around now connectivity you've got Bluetooth 5.2 SPC and AAC and unlike the Elite 4 the 7 Pro does have Multi-Device connection so you can have two devices connected to the earbuds at the same time it's a little bit jittery when you're switching between devices I tested mime and my iPhone and my MacBook and you just have to pause playback on one device before you resume it on the other device you can also use one earbud while you leave the other in the case and this does work in mono mode so if you're using just one earbud you're going to hear both the left and right audio channel so you're not going to miss any of the music that you're listening to now latency with watching videos and movies is completely fine here are the results I got in my gaming latency test on both IOS and Android if you get around 400 milliseconds that's fine for casual games if you want to get around 200 milliseconds if you're into more fast reaction games like Shooters now I want to compare the Elite 4 microphone to the elite 7 Pro from my testing the elite 7 Pro sounds really good it is just a little bit quiet but here are the samples so you can hear for yourself all right so here I am in the outside world currently recording the audio off my iPhone so you can hear all the noise going on around me alright so here is the core quality of the Jabra Elite 7 Pro currently outside it's a little bit windy I'm getting bitten by an ant which is why I'm wiggling around all right and here is the core quality of the Jabra Elite 4 Active In My Memory they're very loud and also pretty good at blocking out background noise potentially better than the 7 Pro all right before we talk about noise canceling if you're enjoying the picky style of review here please subscribe if you haven't yet it helps me up helps the channel out it's also going to help you out if you like the video and you'll be able to see more of my videos in the future now how I test my noise canceling I Chuck on my soundbar I play simulation plane train and Cafe noise that also test all my earbuds in my gym and it's honestly not the best noise canceling for a more modern earbud it's actually very similar to the performance I got on my 75t which didn't even originally have noise canceling when they first came out it came with an update and they're also only just better than the Elite Four so you can get much better noise canceling today at a much cheaper price but it's still pretty solid overall you're gonna block out more consistent sounds quite well it's just the more inconsistent sounds where it doesn't work as well you do have some noise canceling customization in the app so you have this little slider kind of situation going on you just play around with that and see all gives you the best noise canceling result I highly recommend you do that because without that on the noise canceling wasn't that great the Elite Four also have the same thing and the transparency mode is also very solid I'm rating in an 8 out of 10 where you have a pair like the airpods Pro 2 they're a solid 10 out of 10 so very easy to hear things it's quite natural as well and the Elite 4 transparency also just behind the quality of the 7 Pro and you do have the option to customize the transparency strength in the up same on the Elite Four and I have to say the Jabra app is one of my favorite apps out there the user interface is super friendly it's very easy to know what you're doing and you get tons of very small little customization options with nothing unnecessary in there as well and with some of the best sound customization out there but before we talk about the sound quality we'll quickly touch up on volume so if you're looking for loud level listening these go incredibly loud and they also don't distort at high volumes this is the same on the Elite Four now the sound customization here is a pretty simple EQ on the 7 Pro the Elite 4 also has the same EQ with the presets there but I just found that the 7 Pro you could kind of play around that EQ and it would just tail the sound a little bit more where the Elite Four you can increase the bass and it'll kind of take away from the other frequencies so you get a little bit more freedom with the 7 Pro but what the Elite 4 doesn't have is the my Sound hearing test and this is one of the best sound tests that I've ever done a lot of earbuds have it and I find that it doesn't change the sound or it makes it sound really weird and basically you run through a quick hearing test it'll make some beeping sounds in your left and right earbud and this improved the sound quality to like my perfect taste and I just increase the bass and the treble ever so slightly it made the bud sound like 10 better it's a small thing but a 10 increase goes a long way so now I'll talk about the sound with that customization on and overall this is one of the best bass booster tunings out there while retaining a nice balance as well now if you've tried or owned the 75t sadly you're not able to get to base levels where the 75t went they still have the best deep subwoofer base out there like a 9.5 out of 10 on my sub scale where the 7 Pro it's more like an 8 out of 10. you can even EQ that with the bass boost eq1 you're not able to get to the levels that the 75t was able to get to so base this time round has a little bit more punch to it a nice blend of both mid bass and sub bass where the 75 T was more just sub bass so the mid bass did get a bit lacking at times but the base response on the 7 Pro it just works well with any kind of music you throw at it it's not too over the top but nothing is ever lacking and I really like the bass boost EQ on the 7 Pro it boosts the bass to a point I'm not getting too over the top but I like using that when training because I'm not like trying to intricately listen to my music I just want some nice energetic sound and it works really well now the mid-range here is very solid vocals and instrumentation never get lost it's not the best mid-range but it just gets the job done the treble is more of a standout though it doesn't have the most amazing Sparkle but you get some really nice precision and detail I always notice this being a drummer myself things like hi-hats crushes rise symbols have a nice direct sound this also carries over to acoustic guitars synth in electronic music it all has great separation but sounds natural at the same time rarely gets too harsh or similar as well well so if you are a bit more sensitive to treble but like a nice amount of it these are going to be the pair for you now the Sound Stage kind of like the mid-range nothing special but it gets the job done so combining all of this together is a pretty hard tuning default it's not the best sound quality you can get at the price but it's definitely up there with just enough customization to make them work perfectly for yourself now comparing the sound quality to the Elite Four the Elite Four are pretty solid the 7 Pro mainly the treble and the bass just sounds way better plus the EQ customization you have more freedom the my Sound hearing test plus you get the Multi-Device connection the control customization so keep that in mind if you're deciding between the elite four and seven Pro but back to the 7 Pro I gotta say these are 100 worth it today the only real issue is a slightly subpar noise canceling performance but now you're probably thinking how do they compare to other earbuds in the same price like compare to scored and rank them to six other earbuds in the video right here so be sure to check that out in the meantime stay picky I'll see you in the next video bye now
Jabra Elite 7 Pro, all right we got ourselves a showdown here the brand new jabra elite 7 pro against the highly popular apple airpods pro now we're going to find out in this video if you should consider the jabra over the apple so let's get started right now [Music] for those of you that are new here my name's david this is the channel headset advisor where we review and compare all the latest headsets speakerphones and webcams to help you make a better buying decision so hit that subscribe button and notification bell so you don't miss out on future videos just like this one all right i'm going to put the technical specs a side by side of both these wireless earbuds just so you can pause this video if you want to read all of that technical detail now let's take a quick close-up look of each of these designs the jabra has a all black design this is the titanium color it's available in three total colors whereas apple has their signature white color and they have a touch sensitive buttons with apple whereas jabra has actual physical buttons on each wireless earbud you can switch out the ear tips on both these models from small medium to large to help you find a fit that best suits your specific ears which is always nice when you wear the apple you can kind of see it more as it protrudes out a little bit more whereas when you wear the jabra it's a little bit more sleek as far as when you're wearing it doesn't look as vivid or bright to me both of these wireless earbuds utilize bluetooth technology you have 5.2 with jabra and 5.0 with apple which allows you to connect to mobile phones and computers with bluetooth enabled on them apple recommends that you use the air pods of course with apple devices such as your iphone's ipads and mac computers however you can pair it up with other bluetooth enabled devices just so you know but they don't say it's compatible with other ones it's just apple devices jabra is says it's compatible with any bluetooth enabled device both of these headsets weigh in at 0.19 ounces so they're just extremely comfortable for all-day use and they still have pretty good battery life you have five hours up to five hours with apple but you have up to nine hours with jabra so that's very impressive for wireless earbuds that weigh almost as light as clouds do and you can get up to 35 hours of listening time through the charging case and with apple you get up to 24 hours of listening time through the case and that's assuming you don't have active noise cancellation on either of these headsets you have active noise cancellation built into both of these models and both of them have the pass-through technology so if you want to hear your surrounding maybe you're walking in a busy street and don't want to get hit by a car turn on hear through or pass through so that you can hear what's going on around you the price point of both these is 249 for apple and it's 199 for the new jabra elite 7 pro now one last note i want to touch on is the waterproof rating jabra is rated at an ip57 where apple is rated at an ipx4 so it's more just sweat resistant rather than waterproof like the jabra so i did a review of the jabra elite seven and you can check that out here i actually dunked it in water for 10 seconds and still was able to have a phone call and listen to music no problem at all but let's get to the fun stuff let's hook these earbuds up and test out that microphone so that you can hear them loud and clear so now we are talking directly through the apple airpods pro and this is with a completely quiet environment now this is the jabra with both earbuds in this is ultimately what it sounds like on the other end of a phone call or a meeting when you're in a very quiet room now this is office noises going through the camera microphone now we're switching over to the apple airpods pro and this is the office type noises and we'll see 70 to 75 decibels here now this is office noises going through the microphone office now we're on the jabra typically here candle elite seven pros here this is what it sounds like and this speaker is right next to me very loud let's see how many decibels now this is dogs barking through the camera mic with no noise cancellation now you have the apple airpods pro this is what it sounds like testing one two three all right now we have dogs barking through the camera microphone no noise cancellation now we have the jabra this is what it sounds like so if your dog fighter decides to start barking in the middle of your phone call this is what the other end of a phone call will hear if you want to win free headsets we are giving them away every single friday at 10 a.m pacific standard time all you have to do is just enter your email into this url here for your uh chance to win so make sure you enter right now all right now let's get back to the next microphone test all right so this is what the blender sounds like to the camera microphone no noise cancellation now this is the apple airpods pro and this is what's a blender so if you want to blend up your perfect margarita or fruit smoothie this is what it would sound like when you're talking next to it or trying to get through a meeting and this is what people on the other end of that meeting will sound like now this is a blender through the camera mic now we're on the jabra earbuds here so this is what it sounds like next to a blender uh about 80 decibels here all right so this is what it sounds like in a windy environment through the camera now we're on to the apple airpods pro so if you're walking around it's a little windy out this is my what it sounds like now this is what it sounds like with the fan through the camera mic now this is what it sounds like on the jabra mic here there is some rigorous testing with both of these wireless earbuds as far as microphone quality goes what do you think sounded better was it apple or was it jabra both as far as quality of voice and also noise canceling technology put your thoughts in the comment section below would love to hear what you think about the overall microphone performance between these two now in regards to sound quality that is the most important factor that people consider wireless earbuds not only is it not a headset that goes over your head and is bulky but it's small it doesn't mess up your hair and then you can use them to go to the gym you want to sound really good for music podcasts and movies so when it comes to sound quality for both apple and jabra i was listening to them back and forth quite a few times and it's really hard for me to distinguish which one i liked better both sounded very similar had good bass had good uh mids and highs now if i were just a pick maybe i'd say apple you know one percent uh was more favorable for me but it was very very close as far as my personal opinion about the sound quality so that's how good they are getting at making these wireless earbuds and at a price point of 50 less for jabra you know it's definitely one one you want to consider getting just because the price points a little bit lower and you have all of the same audio experience as well as the same features the active noise cancellation the pass through everything that you would want from wireless earbuds is on the jobber as well so something to consider as far as sound quality goes all right now when it comes to comfort this is another big reason that you consider wireless earbuds and choose one brand over the other right now i'm uh i have both earbuds the jabber in my right ear and i have the apple in my left ear here and they definitely feel different on the ears like the apple feel the weight feels like more on the exterior of your ear and kind of the weight is pushing down on the lower part of your ear whereas the jabra feels more like it's going a little bit in your ear canal and feels more balanced as far as weight goes all right now to get to the apple software here but you'll see that you have this airbot icon where your volume icon is so let's go into that just long press into it now what you can do is obviously change the your volume of how loud you hear it through this menu as well as changing to noise cancellation so you can turn your anc feature on or you can turn your transparency mode on and that just allows you to hear what's going on around you or you can set it to off through this app i want to quickly show you the jabra sound plus app that you can download onto your smartphone so if you're looking at the screen now you can see you have different sound modes so you can turn on your active noise cancellation and actually adjust how much active noise cancellation you hear sometimes the problem with a and c is that there's too much and it makes you feel like you're in a silo by yourself and there's no other human being around so to be able to adjust that is a nice feature to have same thing with hear through i just turned it on now i can clearly hear everything that's going on in this room but then you can just adjust it down through this app right like that and then the mic isn't picking up as much noise it kind of gives you a nice balance and then of course you can turn it off you could obviously switch uh your equalizer here this is that mid-range treble bass set it however you want and there's even presets like speech you want to you're listening to some podcasts you can set up for speech or your listen says some wrap so you want to boost that bass so you can adjust it very easily and it also shows you your battery levels of everything which is nice and then this is the app that you would use to update your headset and you can customize and update a lot of the audio experience so when you take the earbud out of your ear you can turn it to take turn it on or turn it off you have a lot of ability to adjust these type of things on the headset one thing i like about it is it has side tone so if you're talking on the phone the microphone is going to pick up your voice a little bit and play it back through your speakers so you can kind of hear your voice because the problem with wearing two earbuds is especially if you have that anc feature on you start yelling because you don't know how loud you're talking because everything's blocked out so by having that side tone control you can hear your own voice a little bit and talk more naturally and normally instead of screaming at people you're talking to so side tone you can turn on and off and then you can adjust it through this app as well there's quite a few other things that you can do through here such as find your headset in case you lose the earbuds which can happen so you can find it through this app as well so that's all i want to show you on the sound plus all right now just wrapping up my final thoughts here they are fantastic obviously apple designs and makes great products and it shows on these now when it comes to the brand new jabra elite 7 pro which one would i choose now i would probably choose the jabra elite 7 pro why well battery life is a big issue especially if you're somebody that's listening to music for a long period of time you don't want to have to keep putting your earbuds back into the case to charge them you're going to get that up to nine hours with the new jabra elite seven pros you also have a lower price point and a two year warranty and then on top of that you have a waterproof rating so i've actually dunked it in water for uh 10 seconds and everything was fine whereas the air pods pro are rated for ipx4 which is more just sweat proof it's not really waterproof so um that is why i would lean more towards jabra but either way again i you can't go wrong with either one they sound fantastic i find them both comfortable i don't find either of them bulky they're both extremely lightweight so comfort is not going to be an issue on these and audio quality is fantastic on both of them so if you're interested in either of these wireless earbuds the links will be in the video description below that helps support this channel so thank you in advance for

coming by we'll see you next time
Jabra Elite 7 Pro, the jabra elite 7 pro came out it was ruined by incomplete firmware thankfully it's gone through several updates making it ready for prime time comes in three colors titanium black gold beige or black which is the one that i'm reviewing today it's packed full of features costs 180 but is often on sale for 160 which makes it incredibly hard to beat for full transparency i did receive this product in exchange for an unbiased written review on bestbuy.com but out of my own volition decided to do a video review they have no idea that this video even exists and it will not bias my opinion in any way shape or form starting off with the fit and comfort fit will vary from person to person as we all have different ear shapes but jobber says that they scanned 62 000 ears to create the perfectly shaped earbud and i must admit they are very comfortable and i often forget they are actually in my ear they have frequency dependent pressure relief vents to prevent the pressurized feeling you can get with some anc devices they use their own unique ear gels over the standard rubber ear tips which will vary in thickness and have a more rounded tip for increased comfort they are some of my favorites as they are extremely soft and malleable and don't cause any irritation in my ear they are very similar to those found in the airpods pro unfortunately they don't have a vent to prevent earwax from entering the speaker which could be an issue for those of you that produce a lot of ear wax they are very secure in my ear and i'm pretty sure i could be knocked into the multiverse and these earbuds wouldn't go anywhere making them great for universe hopping or i mean i guess something more basic like workouts last they sport a physical button over touch making adjustments very easy the earbuds themselves are small lightweight and have an ip57 rating which is nearly unheard of as most other earbuds have an ipx4 rating this means they are highly dust resistant and can be submerged in water up to 3 meters for 30 minutes without harm this is my favorite feature as i wear them all the time in my hot tub and actually have had them fall into the water and taken a lot of showers with them and i've never had any issues so you excessive sweaters out there can rest easy the entire device is made from abs plastic which can be a bit slippery and gets shiny over time i think i would have preferred a different material like the marshall mode 2 have they reported has six microphones but i have no idea where those are actually located when i'm looking at the device as they have two grilles on the front side to the left and to the right which could be the microphones or could be the pressure relief vent for active noise canceling i really don't know on the back you have two pins for charging and in between them is the proximity sensor that's you have l or r so you don't get confused because i guess you could like try putting them in the wrong ear but they are shaped a very specific way so you'd really have to convince yourself that that was right the speaker is extremely small allowing it to tickle your brain they sport a crazy 8 hour battery life compared to the 4 to 5 you see with most other earbuds you can use either bud by itself they quickly connect to each other when going from mono to stereo it has the most modern bluetooth stand which is 5.2 and it quickly connects to your device on the front of the earbud you have a single large button which has mild pre-slash post travel and strong spring back force leading to a very crisp click that they absolutely nailed you do hear that click in said ear further notifying you that the button has indeed been pressed there is about a second delay before it does anything which is pretty status quo as far as latency goes but is something they could definitely improve on if you're giving it a lot of inputs it can occasionally freak out where the connection for both of the earbuds will flutter to be synced but this resolves in about a second each earbud has a small led on the front to notify you what the earbud is doing when you place them in the case it will blink red for charging when you take them out it will be green for on each time you press the button it will turn green to notify you that it registered to click interestingly when the in-ear detection is turned on and it isn't actually in your ear that button is disabled and won't register any inputs which is a nice feature that a lot of other earbuds simply forget about when you go into the pairing mode by holding both buttons down it will flash blue last the led stays off and doesn't blink during noble normal use meaning it won't be distracting in a dark room they also have a voice assistance where it will guide you through what it is doing such as connected two devices connected disconnected to pair go to the bluetooth menu on your smartphone etc and the voice is well done as for the case it is excellent as well it is small and compact making and easy to fit in the pocket or bag the outer shell is made from the same abs plastic as the earbuds with the same problems being quite shiny slippery and picking up smudges like a boss but is quite resistant to scratches and still looks almost brand new despite regular use on the front you have a usbc charging port and just above that is the led that will change based on the overall charge these percentages are estimates by me but give you a good general idea of what they should be at with green being greater than 75 yellow slash amber for 25 to 75 charge and red for less than 25 on the bottom you have the q key symbol i don't know how to say it for wireless charging which works well with the top and bottom of the case being flush and it being very small you need some serious moves to get it open with one hand upon opening the case all three leds will illuminate to notify you everything is working the inside has a rubber texture along with charging pins for each bud this rubber is smudge central and can get mucked up from earwax but is easy to clean the earbuds are held in magnetically snap into place which makes them feel high quality the angle they sit at makes them very easy to remove the latch is magnetic and feels good to open and close but the hinge appears to be mostly plastic which gives me some concerns going into the battery life the earbuds have eight hours of battery compared to the usual four to five as i mentioned earlier with the case being around 22 hours which is about average most the time i see 24 for a total of 30 hours from my non-scientific testing this is pretty accurate they report a 292 hours of standby time other earbuds will stay on in a low power mode to quickly connect when taken out of the case but will continuously drain the battery which is horrifically stupid seriously it drives me nuts as when you go to use them after a week or more they will be dead making them completely pointless these may do the same thing as they connect very quickly but i've gone a month or more without using them only to pick them up and have plenty of juice left in them nice when the earbuds get to about 20 percent they will tell you the battery is low then go a long time before telling you it is low again as it gets to the two to three percent range it increases in frequency during each of these alerts i noticed some static and disconnection from each button which sorted itself out within a second or two you can get an hour charge in five minutes greater than 50 charge in 30 minutes and a full charge in 2.5 hours which seems dramatically longer but they probably do that to save the battery over a long period of time by not allowing it to heat up too much as for the sound i've tried the airpods airpod pros sennheiser momentum jabra 75t lg tone fn9 marshall mode 2 and several other cheaper wireless earbuds and these are the best sounding i rate them an 8.5 out of 10. they support six millimeter custom speakers to eliminate sound distortion while using intelligent algorithms to constantly adjust and optimize sound frequencies which sounds awesome translated to real world performance from marketing speak they have a colored neutral sound where the highs mids and bass never overbear each other vocals sound great and you can feel the emotion instruments are accurate bass is accurate but not booming they have great imaging where i can easily separate different instruments vocals and other nuanced sounds they get plenty loud and can actually get into the unhealthy range where it would actually damage your hearing if you're not careful i don't notice any differences with the audio quality when anc or hear through is on or off which makes sense as those are the intelligent algorithms at work and also having consistent sound in several different situations these have gone through several firmware updates since i first got them they used to have horrific latency but this has improved to the point i don't notice it at all anymore moving on to the microphone which is the most disappointing aspect of these as the marketing makes them seem like they are the best thing since sliced bread they're reported has jabra multi-sensor voice tech which uses four microphones with a voice pickup vpu sensor in each bud that is supposed to automatically activate to focus on your voice and reduce disruptive sounds such as wind while also using bone conduction tech to transmit voice via vibrations in the jawbone which is absolutely great marketing they do a great job at eliminating wing noises but while doing that they also eliminate your voice which is no bueno since their inception they have been average sounding at times they can sound really good and other times they can sound absolutely horrific making them incredibly inconsistent due to the heavy marketing here are several different earbud mics to give you an accurate representation of where these fit and welcome my name is tommy and today i am doing a review of the jabra elite 7 pro because i'm interested to see how these sound in comparison to a bunch of other wireless bluetooth headsets so we'll see right now hello and welcome my name is tommy and today i am bringing you an audio review of the lg tone fn9 i fp9 i don't remember it's something like that hello and welcome my name is thomas and today i am doing a quick audio review of the marshall mode 2 because i really want to compare them to the jabra elite 7 pro hello and welcome my name is tommy and today i am doing a quick review of the apple airpods pro to see what this microphone sounds like it has been a very long time since i've actually used my original airpod pros not airpods just airpods not even the pros to do an audio recording so i'm just kind of interested in what this is going to sound like for those of you who are still wanting to use these for daily chats they have something called peak stop tech that protects your hearing by constantly monitoring the sound level of your conversation and cutting off any sounds that go above 118 decibels but does not support intellitone which works as a limiter to keep decibels in the safe zone all the time moving on to a anc and hear through these have fantastic passive noise isolation so good that i thought i had a and c on but didn't the active noise cancellation which is a and c has drastically improved where they easily drown out noises when driving fans or went outside so you're just left with silence so much so that i think they go head-to-head with the airpods pro and to be honest i'm really not sure which one i would give the win to here through has also gone dramatically better where i can use it and feel moderately comfortable that i'm hearing everything that i need to hear but not everything that i necessarily want to hear directional audio is in the middle of the road it gets the job done and is better than most of the competition but still leaves me wanting a lot more i'd rate it a 6 out of 10. with the airpods pro being a 10 out of 10. moving on to multipoint when these first came out they didn't have multi-point it has since been added and works great where you can be connected to two devices at the same time with up to eight devices held in memory the jobber sound plus app is excellent it has a ton of features which include my controls which allows you to edit what each earbud does or doesn't do myfit which plays a sound that the headset can analyze to make sure you have a good fit and my sound which allows you to go through a hearing test and comes up with a custom eq for your hearing ears you can select your smart assistant which includes siri amazon alexa and google assistant with the last two being on android only but have noticed that when using siri on an iphone you can activate it through the earbuds but the info that it reads out comes through the phone speakers instead of the earbuds which is super weird supports sleep mode where you can select a sound to play throughout the night for those of you that enjoy sleeping with earbuds in you also have a 5 band eq you can adjust the noise cancelling strength along with hear through strength you can select if you want the music to auto pause when the earbud is removed from the ear or not along with turn off after x amount of time definitely one of the best experiences that i've had moving on to the conclusion these are the second best earbuds i own and i've tried only being beaten by the airpod pros they trade a lot of blows the anc transparency mode call quality sirius and messaging alerts go to the airpods pro and with the anc thing i'm really i'm still unsure on the fence with that but the battery life sound quality ip57 rating and controls go to the jabra the rest case size comfort etc is a wash regardless i think these are some of the best wireless earbuds on the market and really enjoy them if you pick them up i would love to hear your thoughts in the comment section below otherwise like dislike share subscribe if you like otherwise we'll see you and you'll be able to face on the next one god bless and peace out
Jabra Elite 7 Pro, what's up guys dave here back again with another episode of tech unraveled and today today i have these the jabra elite 7 pro so you know what we're going to do right we're going to get this box popped we're going to explore all of its contents we're going to do an audio test a mic test an active noise cancellation and of course a latency test sit back relax grab that popcorn let's do it let's go right meow [Music] all right guys before we get started on the audio portion of the test i wanted to go through the app you can see that we are connected i got 100 battery power on both earbuds 91 on the case itself it pretty much came charged i did not plug it in or anything yet if we scroll down just a little bit you get your active noise cancellation your hear through modes to select you have your equalizer here and you are able to completely customize it exactly to your liking which is cool i'm going to go ahead and put it back on bass boost because that's the way i like my music later now there are also some different soundscape sounds that you can get and play on the earbuds if you would just like to relax maybe do a little meditation have the ocean waves playing in the background or whatever you put in there if we scroll up here we have this little gear i already went ahead and updated us to the latest firmware that was available we can go into the headset settings and you can go to your audio experience this is going to give you the ability to auto pause and play by taking them in and out of your ears this also gives you some additional options with the hear through mode right here and your my sound settings so that is what's in here let's go to call experience now you can mute the reminder tone so basically it'll play a reminder tone periodically when the microphone is muted just to let you know your side tones hear your own voice when on a call and you can adjust this that way you can actually hear yourself speaking which is good because otherwise you might start getting very loud while talking on the phone and then you have equalizer and in this case i always like to pump up the trouble while i'm speaking on the phone so i really like having this feature included i think that's actually really nice headset configuration so you can choose how the earbuds cycle by tapping on the side in here you have your sleep mode headset guidance in this case you can select the type of guidance you prefer if you want a voice a tone or nothing at all i'm just going to go ahead and leave it actually on voice for now and ear detection and basically this is going to determine if the earbud is in your ear for auto play pause which is kind of redundant right let's go back here audio experience yeah it's kind of redundant feature but okay i like it now you have a discovery mode so there's a lot of options in here you can allow push notifications about updates right to your notification bar obviously you can personalize your anc now i went ahead and i set this all up to figure out what was the best setting for me basically you put them in your ear you play a bunch of loud noise and you go through and you move the bar as needed for your use case one other step that i did do while setting these earbuds up was a sound test so that it really knew how i could hear things and adjust and tweak the sound profile to me so with that said it's time to listen to some music it is now audio test time let me get these popped in my ears turn on some tunes and let's go [Music] turn that down a little [Music] nice god the highs are so crisp all right guys here's the deal the highs are crisp clear i can hear everything inside of the song i can hear the instruments the vocalist's voice while the bass is going everything is meshed very nice the mids are milky smooth and the bass although does not rattle my brain it is punchy it hits i like it the whole listening experience is very very good currently these come in at 199 and i say they live up to that price point for audio so the next step is let's see if they live up to the hype when it comes to the mic let's do that right now it is mic test time all right guys so it is my test time and as always we are going to test both in studio and in my car so up first is the in studio and this is the sound of my voice with the jabber elite 7 pros let's go ahead and introduce some ambient noise into the background again this is the sound of my voice with the jabra elite 7 pros let's go hop in my car real quick be right back all right guys so we are now in my car and the windows are up this is what your voice would sound like with the chopper elite seven pros while driving in your car we're gonna crack them about four to six inches and then i'm gonna put them all the way down that way you can see how they hold up against wind here we go all right so currently the windows are cracked about four to six inches and this is the sound of my voice with the jabra elite seven pros let's go ahead and crack them all the way again now they're all the way down and this is the sound of my voice with the jabra elite pro alright guys so what did you think of the mic test overall let me know down in the comments below what your thoughts are with that said it is now active noise cancellation time so let's get ted ted is a binary microphone and basically there is a mic in each one of his ears i'm gonna play some ambient sounds in the background and i'm gonna cycle through the different settings that are within the jabra app we're gonna go through the hear through and the active noise cancellation and you'll actually be able to hear what it should sound like if these earbuds were in your ears so with that said let's get the potty started okay so right now all of the features are actually turned off on ted so this is the normal setting hear through mode active noise cancellation is turned off and what i'm going to do first is cycle through each one then we'll start playing some ambient noise and we'll go through the process so here we go first is hear through mode now there is a slider on the app here so you can set it up to the way you like it i personally have it maxed out and this is going to make everything really crisp around you really loud you should really be able to hear my voice very loudly very clearly now let's go ahead and cycle through an active noise cancellation and again this has a similar slider and i have it maxed out all of the way so my voice should have gotten very quiet and very muffled you shouldn't really be able to hear me very much at all if they are doing a good job what i went ahead and did is turn all of the features back off so all the settings are off and i'm going to start playing some noise in the background with it off now i'm going to stop speaking and i'm going to cycle through each setting that way you can kind of hear with the noise playing in the background here we go here is hear through mode [Music] after noise cancellation off again active noise cancellation all right guys so what did you think of the active noise cancellation i haven't used the feature personally yet so i don't know i won't know until i actually listen to the audio back but go ahead and leave your comments down below let's do that latency test all right guys so as always we are going to be testing on an ios and android device the ios device i will be using is an iphone 13 pro max and the android device is a google pixel 5 8 5g now keep in mind these are not marketed as a gaming earbuds there is no gaming mode let's see how they do iphone is up first [Applause] all right guys let's go ahead and switch it over to the android phone all right guys so there you have it we did an audio test a mic test an active noise cancellation and latency test if you like this video or i helped you in any way smash that thumbs up if you haven't already subscribe and hit the bell that way you get notified of my next video i will talk to you in the next one peace you
Jabra Elite 7 Pro, what's going on guys welcome back to another video today we're taking a look at the jabra elite 7 pro these are coming in at 200 bucks and they are the latest pair of active noise cancelling earbuds from jabra so let's go ahead and check them out starting off with the charging case so this time around they kind of went away from the usual upright design that we typically see from jabra this one's got more of a clamshell design and i think this is the first charging case that i've ever seen with the charging port on the front of the case not quite sure how i feel about that yet but there it is and right above that you have a single led indicator to help you gauge your battery life and also the case does support wireless charging you've got a matte finish all the way around overall build quality feels really good and you've got some nice strong magnets to help keep the earbuds in place moving over to the earbuds these are much smaller than the previous jabra elite models especially the 85 t so that is going to impact the fit which we'll talk more about later and then this time around they went back to the round silicone ear tips compared to the oval ear tips that we saw on the 85 t when it comes to the controls they are physical button controls and they are fully customizable within the jabra app so you're getting all of your playback controls including volume as well as your ambient sound control and if you don't like the default configuration you can create your own so the earbuds are running bluetooth 5.2 and they're using sbc as well as aac for their audio codecs so no aptx which is something we did see with the jabra elite 3 you are getting independent use so you can use either the left or the right earbud independently and then these have an ip57 dust and water resistant rating which makes these the first waterproof anc earbuds that i think i've come across most active noise cancelling earbuds are going to give you an ipx4 rating at the highest so with these having that ip57 rating technically you can submerge them in water when it comes to battery life you're looking at roughly eight hours on a single charge and that extends to a total of 30 hours with the case and these do feature fast charge so just five minutes of charging will give you roughly one hour of listening time you're also getting auto pause or smart pause which means that anytime you remove one of the earbuds from your ear your music will automatically pause and then once you replace them back in your ear it'll automatically resume something i was hoping for was multi-point connection but as of right now you're not getting that with these earbuds there are some rumors going around that this may come later through a firmware update so we'll have to see how that plays out now when it comes to the fit with these being the smallest earbuds that i've ever tested from jabra they fit me better than any of the other previous models so if you have small ears like myself these are going to be your best bet when it comes to jobber earbuds in terms of comfort about two hours is when i started to experience some fatigue i think if you have larger sized ears you'll be able to wear them for longer periods of time and then as far as the button controls they're very accurate and as usual they don't require a whole lot of pressure to use them so it doesn't feel like you're just jamming the earbuds deeper into your ear whenever you're trying to control your music or answer a phone call now when it comes to the sound quality you're getting that typical dynamic sound that we're used to seeing from jabra you're getting plenty of bass plenty of mids and highs and you have a fully customizable eq within the jabra sound app so you can come up with your own eq profile or you can choose from a short list of eq profiles and if that's not enough they also have the my sound feature which basically develops a custom eq profile based on your hearing as far as the base i do feel like you get more of that boomy subwoofer type feel on some of the previous jabra elite models especially the jabra elite 75t you're still getting a good amount of bass on the elite 7 pro it just feels a little bit more controlled and not quite as boomy as some of the previous models overall i do like the sound again it's very dynamic especially once you start playing around with the eq controls you can really dial the sound to a level that works for you and on top of that you are getting some really good max volume now when it comes to the active noise cancellation these are pretty close to the 85 t i think they're slightly more effective and that could be due to the round ear tips providing a better seal compared to the oval ear tips of the 85 t you're also getting an adjustable slider within the jabra app so you have five different levels of active noise cancellation i would still say bose and sony are at the top in terms of anc and then i would put these in the tier right underneath those when it comes to the transparency mode it is extremely effective so for those times you want to hear all of your surrounding noises these will certainly help you do that some people might feel that the highest setting is a little bit too strong so you can dial it back a little within the jabra app to get a more natural sound but overall it does work very well now when it comes to phone calls these are using what jabra calls its multi-sensor voice technology so it's using a total of four microphones along with bone conducting sensors to give you the best possible call quality so let's go ahead and do a microphone test to give you guys an idea as to how you would sound if you choose to use these for phone calls alright so this is a microphone test of the jabra elite seven pro testing testing one two three testing testing one two three uh this is a quiet environment so now let's go ahead and see how they sound once we add some background noise all right now we got some crowd noise being played on a bluetooth speaker right to the left of me here so this should give you a rough idea as to how you would sound if you choose to use these in a more noisy environment testing testing one two three testing testing one two three so overall i think the jabra elite seven pro are an excellent option if they're able to add multi-point connection through a firmware update i think that would make these even more attractive but you're getting great sound quality solid active noise cancellation a really effective transparency mode and excellent call quality so that's going to be it for this video do me a favor if you found the video to be helpful go ahead and give it a thumbs up as well as subscribe to the channel and if you're interested in grabbing a pair of these earbuds be sure to check out the affiliate links down in the description aside from that as always i'll see you guys next time
Jabra Elite 7 Pro, the jabber elite 7 pro are flagship anc earbuds that come in at 200 pounds in the uk and 200 in the us and in this detailed review we'll be seeing if it's actually worth its price tag specifically in comparison to some of its major competitors now the earbuds don't get off to a good start because they are limited to the sbc and ac codecs only whereas a lot of his competitors support the aptx aptx hd or even the highest quality ldac or hwa codex it's a real shame that jabra hasn't incorporated these higher fidelity codecs because it would have improved on the overall audio fidelity that you can get over bluetooth nevertheless i was actually pretty taken back as to how good these earphones sound across the frequency range the six millimeter dynamic drivers do a stupendously good job now let's break it down in terms of each frequency range first off in terms of these sub-bass tones the jabra elite 7 pro very much like their predecessors the jabra elite 85t or 75t pronounce that low end rumble and therefore when you're listening to r b or dance music or even watching movies you're going to get a little bit of excitement and you're going to hear that low end rumble something that sennheiser for example can't really claim in doing similarly when it comes to the mid bass it's pretty punchy and yes you can eq it which i'll showcase very shortly but in its real default configuration the mid-bass tones are actually pretty perfect the overall quantity and quality is pinpoint accurate at least to my ears and i had no problems whatsoever in this department now as for the mids i was yet again taken back by the oval sound reproduction throughout the frequency range now they're not quite sennheiser-esque whereby they're not as forward-sounding as their sennheiser rivals but in comparison to pretty much every other earphone out there in the market they will come across in an excellent fashion take for example the grado gt220s the likes of the jabra elite 85t and 75t the oppo nco x the anker soundcore liberty 3 pros and even the libritone track air plus or the gen 2 variants of them all of these earphones have got a much more pushback and recessed v-shaped sound signature and it's not the same thing that could be said about the jabra earphones which yet again really took me by surprise now as for the highs they're a little bit overzealous at the top end at least in their standard configuration but thankfully you can eq that to your heart's content through the app and again i will talk about that very shortly but what i would like to point out over here is that they do extend very well and give you all the nice symbols and the top end clarity that you'll want and keep you kind of excited when you're listening to your music so with this in mind if you do not have sensitive ears then i think this standard configuration will pretty much suffice if however you're like me and you have a little bit more sensitive ears then that slight eq that you can take off the highs provides a pretty likable sound and one that doesn't give you any fatigue either and so what about when it comes to its sound stage because fundamentally the jabra earphones have got a much more smaller form factor in comparison to the likes of the sennheiser greater or newer true alternatives and indeed its rivals do a better job in providing a more airy sound stage however that's not quite the entire picture because when it comes to instrument separation while all of these earphones do a fantastic job in my opinion the jabras are the best in class and that's coming from someone who's reviewed in excess of 70 different true wireless earbuds and over 500 audio related devices i was absolutely taken back by the instrument separation of the jabra elite seven pros and it left me kind of jaw dropped i was able to enjoy my music in almost a different dimension and not in an artificial sense but one that really just got me to appreciate music all that bit more in a set of true wireless earbuds now sound quality is seriously impressive but what about when it comes to recording quality well yet again here jabra have done a phenomenal job i was very impressed with the jabra elite 75t which i often use as a reference and that progressed to the 85 t's which did an even better job and yet again here very much like the 85t the elite 7 pro do a great job of portraying my voice accurately and not sounding over bloated or kind of phased out towards the mid-range tones indeed if you want fantastic call quality the jabra earphones in my opinion still reign supreme speaking about one of its predecessors here the jabra elite 75t which you'll be able to pick up sounds very good on the whole but they'll sound a little bit boomier towards the lower end tones whereas the elite seven pros portrayed a little bit more of a more well-rounded and balanced sound signature when it comes to recording and just for comparison here's one of the rival earphones that you can find out there in the market and it's the oppo nco x the earphones just don't do as well when it comes to recording quality and of course there's some other earphones out there and i could continue this list of recording quality tests but it just gives you an indication of how other earphones compare to the jabra earphones specifically the elite 7 pros however it's not all positive because the jabras fall short when it comes to active noise cancellation and alas over here the elite 7 pros aren't anywhere near as good as its competitors from the likes of one more to the likes of sony or neura or let's say for example the anchor earphones oppo or libritone all these other earphones provide fast superior anc performance and here unfortunately the jabras fall short so much so that if i were to compare even the jabra elite 75t which are far cheaper earphones and you combine the passive noise isolation and the active noise cancellation technology you'd almost potentially choose the 75t over the likes of the elite 7 pro at least to my ear canals here i just found that the elite 7 pros while i had a fantastic fit and comfort with them just again didn't provide the same sort of passive noise isolation as the slightly chunkier elite 75 t's in this domain if we take passive noise isolation completely out of the department here the overall active noise cancellation is pretty much on par with its much cheaper sibling and therefore means that when you are comparing these earphones to class leading or even medium to high-tier anc earphones out there on market the jabra elite 7 pros really fall short so i referenced the app quite a few times so let's get into it now first off at the top you can see the battery level from the case and the earphones themselves and then you've got the active noise cancellation which you can adjust in terms of a couple of increments and the same could be said about the hear through mode so yes indeed you've got a hear through mode if you want to use it and of course if you don't want any of this you can disable it now as for the music equalizer you can see i've customized it where i've dropped the highs and the lows a little bit and increased the mids just that bit more for the more balanced sound stage but of course that is completely subjective you can completely customize that through the five band equalizer or go through one of the preset eqs now if you go through the settings cog here you're going to reveal a lot more options first off if you've gone to headset settings you've got the audio experience where you can enable music being played when you are running hear through mode you can also have my sound and this is a customized hearing profile in my case i can i completely disable that because i just didn't feel that it really bolstered the experience and as for the call experience you've then got for example the site turns which you can enable and also adjust as well which is again nice to see so the customization is definitely there and then you've got the headset configuration where you can enable how the sound modes behave you've got sleep modes headset feedback so for example when you're touching let's say the earbuds on the right hand side it gives you an indication of to what setting you're running and you've got in your detection so in other words it's a little sensor which mentions to see if you want it continuously playing when it's in your ears or when you take it out then you've also got a way of personalizing it so for as i said before you've got a different ways of customizing for example the active noise cancellation or in terms of the sound and of course when it comes to controls now when it comes to controls you can customize the left and right earbuds independently which is nice to see and you've got quite a lot of different options so for example single press or you can press and hold as well now when it comes to the options well you've got a few options to select from but the options in my opinion are pretty much what you would expect and will suffice for a lot of individuals out there and furthermore you can also customize it between between calls in terms of active or incoming calls and also in terms of media so it's pretty smart in terms of recognizing that elsewhere you can select your voice assistant where it's got amazon alexa built in as well if you want to use that and you can also check for firmware updates if you've got a latest firmware and therefore when you want to add extra features to the earphones now with the app aside i should also mention that when it comes to connectivity the earphones can be used independently from each other and therefore can be used in a mono format the switch is absolutely instantaneous and here jabra should be really commended for what they've done i've also heard that they also will be supporting multi-point connection as well which means that switching between devices should be a little bit more seamless now as for the earphones themselves the overall color of them i have no issues whatsoever they're available in three separate finishes and in this respect i find out pretty stylish now they've got a button found a physical button should i say found on each of the earbuds and as i showed you can customize it through the app however pressing the button does mean that you can hear it being clicked whilst it's in your ear canal and therefore isn't as comfortable as the likes of touch sensitive earphones which are good in this compartment say for example likes of the sennheiser true wireless momentum twos or the oppo enco x here these earphones provide really good touch sensitive pads and means that well it doesn't feel that you're kind of shoving the earbuds in your ears a little bit more when you are interacting with them but of course that is pretty subjective now this perfectly leads me on to the overall form factor of the earphones they're really slender in comparison to other audiophile grade earphones and while they're not the likes of let's say the oppo nco x when it comes to their stem design it does mean that when it comes to in comparison to let's say the likes of the sennheiser grader or neura true alternatives these earphones are far more comfortable i wouldn't go as far as saying that you can sleep on them but i will say that they're very comfortable i had no problems when it comes to doing light jogs either they don't really fall out of my ears but again that is quite subjective and it really depends on your own ear canals if you really want something for workouts then you're really going to be looking for something with an over ear design instead moving past that we do also get onto battery life and here the earphones have got an eight hours charge and which is pretty good and with the case it extends up to 30 hours the case also has wireless charging and also it has a usb type-c input which allows for fast charging which is great to see and finally it's also worth bearing in mind that the earphones are dust and waterproof where they're ip57 rated and so this brings me onto my verdict would i recommend the jabra elite 7 pros well quite frankly they do great across the board whereby they offer a really nice comfortable design they've also got a relatively small form factor a bit from the earbuds themselves to the charging case they've also got a good battery life and they offer fantastic sound and recording qualities however they fall short in two departments at least in my opinion and that's when it comes to anc performance and the overall bluetooth codec support however it should be worth bearing in mind that the former here isn't that impressive in the likes of the sennheiser or great alternatives either they either don't offer anc altogether and or have pretty poor anc performance too then you've got the likes of the newer trues which are an alternative that you might want to consider however if you're going to be taking calls or want to be using them on the go then the call quality of the mirrors are well no match whatsoever with all the other earphones i've mentioned specifically the jabras so here for me personally it's between three earphones the sennheiser and the grados and then the jabras if you're looking for a bassy or sound and you want something that's quite airy then you might want to look at the grados if you want something that's more mid-century but a little bit bass light and still airy in terms of its sound stage then you might want to look at the sennheisers if however you want a little bit of both but then don't have the same sort of airy nature and then also want class leading call quality then you should pick the jabras and for that reason they actually get my best buy awards so i'd be intrigued to hear your thoughts in the comment section below would you buy these earphones over the rivals specifically the ones i've just mentioned well just let me know i'm just curious to see what you would pick now of course if you like this independent detailed and honest review definitely do drop a like and of course subscribe and hit that bell notification all of which would be greatly appreciated and you can even follow my shenanigans on social media where on my instagram and twitter links will be down in the description below including to all the earphones that i've referenced including the reviews to each of these two now i've been totally dubbed and i'll hopefully see you in the next one take care of yourselves and goodbye
Sony WF-1000XM5, foreign folks I'm here with a product that a lot of people have been looking forward to Sony's new flagship wf-1000x Mark V noise canceling earbuds that list for 300 for 20 dollars more than the mark IVs those were great buds the xm4s and we gave them a CNET editors Choice Award when they came out two years ago but there's always room for improvement and with this new completely redesigned model Sony has addressed most of the small gripes people had with its predecessor are the mark 5S perfect not quite but overall they're really impressive easily among the top top earbuds on the market so let's dive right into the review to find out just how they're improved and how they stack up to the competition the first thing you'll notice about them is that they're smaller than the xm4s by about 25 percent and also 20 percent lighter according to Sony with each Bud weighing 6 grams by comparison the airpods Pro 2 weight 5.3 grams each their charging case is smaller to about 15 percent smaller and does have wireless charging capabilities I have both sets of earbuds here the mark IVs are a little big and while they fit my ears nicely they don't necessarily fit people with small ears well like co-worker Tara says she has smaller ears so I had her try both sets of buds and the smaller xm5s did work better for her should I do it this back into my ear this one's very sturdy in my ear and very lightweight as well the buds come in black or silver and are partially constructed from recycled materials the xm4s have a matte finish that I like in contrast these mix in a glossy finish there's a little apprehensive about it first but the outer part of the buds where the touch controls live has a matte finish so it doesn't pick up fingerprints I also appreciate that the buds don't stick out of your ears as much as their predecessors did one issue I had with the xm4s that hasn't been resolved is the ear tips that come with the buds which now include a set of extra small tips among the four options they should fit most ears just fine but they just don't quite give me the Tight Seal that you really need for optimal sound quality and noise canceling performance the tips are made out of a high-tech polyurethane foam material that's designed to conform to your ear canal and offer some attic grip so the earbuds stay in your ears more securely but their shape isn't quite right for my ears I need tips that are a little wider and rounder and I had to swap in a set of my preferred silicone tips that allow me to get a better seal it'd be nice Sony included a wider variety of tips but as I said the majority of you shouldn't have a problem with the ones you get and many of you should be able to get a secure enough fit to run with these they are ipx4 Splash proof and sweat resistant okay on to Features Sony's Flagship headphones and earbuds have always been loaded with features and these Mark 5 buds add some new feature upgrades to go along with the existing favorites like speak to chat a mode you can enable that automatically pauses your music and activates the headphones ambient mode when you start talking to someone ambient mode is similar to Apple's transparency mode but with these Sony's you can adjust the level of Ambient sound you want to let in all right I've got my music on here and then I'll start talking to my camera woman numi and if I want to have a conversation with her the music has completely paused I can hear the outside world I can talk to her and then as soon as I stop talking five seconds later the music comes back on I'm not gonna go through all the earbuds features in this video but I'll highlight the ones that stand out for me first you get multi-point Bluetooth pairing so you can pair the buds with two devices simultaneously and easily switch audio back and forth between them after that there are plenty of EQ settings to help tweak the sound and some adaptive sound modes plus support for hands-free Alexa that feature allows you to tap into Amazon's Voice Assistant without pressing anything on the buds also there's a new beta setting called find your equalizer that lets you choose between a series of EQ setting tweaks to find the sound you like best like the mark IVs these buds have ear detection sensors that pause your music when you take an earbud out yes you can use a single earbud if you want and resume playback when you put it back in but what's new is spatial audio with head tracking currently it's only available for Android users according to Sony and it's unclear if Apple users will ever get it but in my test it seemed to work a lot like Apple's spatial audio for video watching these are also compatible with the new le audio standards so in the future you should get access to features like aracast broadcast audio that would allow you for example to tap into an audio stream being broadcast from a certain TV at the gym while you're on a treadmill finally the mark 5 support Sony's ldac audio codec using ldac can get you slightly better sound quality if you're streaming high-res audio tracks from streaming services like Coba as in Tidal iPhone users get the AAC audio codec but a lot of Android phones support ldac if there's a feature that's missing it's some sort of find my buds feature built into the Sony headphones app the airpods Pro 2 have a Precision find my feature it really does come in handy at times as far as performance goes these do feel like a bump up from the xm4s though it's not a Quantum Leap they have new speaker driver units and three microphones in each bud and they're powered by two new proprietary Sony chipsets with more processing power the V2 integrated processor and the qn2e noise canceling processor Sony's been in a nip and Tuck battle with bows for the best noise canceling and Sony says these buds have the best toys canceling based on its tests it's not a huge upgrade over the noise canceling that the xm4s offer but it is a little more effective and is quite impressive overall like Bose's quiet Comfort earbuds 2 these buds are supposed to do a better job muffling a broader range of frequencies for my anecdotal testing they're right there with the Bose buds for noise canceling but it's hard to declare an outright winner the Bose also has great noise canceling there are also improvements to sound quality but again it's not a big bump up from the xm4s which already sounded excellent that said I thought the xm5s just sound a little cleaner with a little better bass definition everything's been tightened up a bit tonally they're a little warmer sounding than the airpods Pro 2 which also sound excellent for their size but the Sony's arguably have a slight Edge in tonal balance they're just a very pleasant set of earbuds to listen to and some of the best sounding earbuds out there right now as for voice calling Sony says you're getting its best ever call Quality the earbuds have bone conduction sensors that Sony says pick up the vibration of your voice directly from your skull bones helping to isolate your speech from ambient sounds and background noise for Clear calls even in loud environments I was generally impressed with the call Quality and noise reduction in particular but under harsher conditions a few callers did say my voice wobbled a bit here's a test call I recorded that gives you a sense of the call Quality though note that the call is recorded via the Internet so you lose a little bit of Fidelity in my voice all right I'm here on the streets of New York to do a test call with fellow editor John Falcone John had some uh some wind I got a bunch of traffic going by let me know how I sound you sound pretty good overall I would say there's a a bit of uh fuzziness and warbliness when you talk but otherwise especially when you're not talking um don't hear any background noise at all and uh it's generally Pretty good overall battery life is the same as what you get with the xm4s around eight hours on a single charge with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels and up to 12 hours with it off the case holds two extra charges that's a couple of hours better than what you get with the airpods Pro 2 which are around six hours so very good battery life overall as I said my intro these really are impressive earbuds though they're not perfect and I'm sure Sony will issue some firmware updates to fix some bugs and perhaps improve performance a bit but the key takeaway here is that Sony has managed to make its Flagship earbuds significantly smaller while actually improving upon performance with incremental upgrades noise canceling and sound quality and a slightly bigger upgrade to voice calling and for Android users anyway there's spatial audio with head tracking Apple users may find some advantages with the airpods Pro 2 whether it's from a fit or features perspective as I've said before the airpods Pro 2 are hard to beat for Apple users they sound great for their size and also offer excellent noise canceling and they are are being discounted to around 200 or 100 less than these I also like the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds 2 and the new Beats Studio buds plus which do cost significantly less but the wf-1000x mark fives really are the complete package particularly for Android users yeah you could quibble about them not including a wider variety of ear tips and maybe missing a feature or two and costing so much but they do largely live up to their hype so there is that but let me know what you think in the comments section and if you haven't subscribed to this channel already please do I'm David Carr for CNET thanks for watching
Sony WF-1000XM5, I'm so excited because let's face it if you're shopping for truly Wireless in your earphones budget provided you've probably got these in your short list this is the fifth generation of sonyist wf-1000xm5s they've been great for many generations I spent most of my time with the xm3s they were already awesome but I can see a lot has changed since then and even compared to the xm4s there's there's some changes extra small ear tips now come along with the smallest largest and mediums I guess these rolled out of here I'm assuming oh those must be the medium someone put the extra Smalls on we'll mess with those later what else is in this box which appears to be made of recycled material you've got this little wallet here for the literature not really gonna mess with that except this looks like a promotional thing maybe 360 reality audio a little tiny USB C to a charging cable for your case and that's it and then you've got this tiny case which is 15 smaller than last year's case and a lot smaller than the one that I tried I think still um this colorway is black with the copper highlights it also comes in silver and you've got a reset button on the back and a USBC charging port decent but a little bit sharp on the closed sound but I can mess with that little indicator for battery level on the front that's a green right now and here they are the buds themselves also smaller this time 20 lighter as well okay so they're glossy looking with matte black on the touch area and little copper vents there it's that silicone or foam kind of foamy but you can see there's little cracks and and stuff in it like definitely some kind of foam yeah they're all foam all right let's see how I like that there's a left and right indicators on here right as red stick them in they're very light oh I just heard a tone and now I can sense that transparency mode is on these are very light holy I think that I have earplugs at home that are the same weight as these and lightness is is I would say highly correlated to comfort over time I just put them back in the case for a second because I've seen other comments from media saying they're hard to get out of the case that's how I kind of knocked it out without even trying um I didn't notice that but maybe I can see what you're saying because the clearance on the top end for you to get your finger in there is maybe a bit tight but seems okay honestly I probably wouldn't have noticed that all right they're back in I'm gonna check out the app and check out the interactions first you know these are they're really in there it's like a deceiving feeling I guess it it must just have to do with the ear tips themselves if he got a good seal with those they're gonna stay in they've got an ipx4 English production rating for waterproofness so X means they didn't measure the dust protection and four is water and that is uh just splashes this is a very typical even budget earphones will have X4 so nothing great there you could maybe wear these in the shower definitely you could wear them in the rain to the gym but don't go swimming yeah what's going on in here they really want you to sign in what am I gonna get adaptive sound control that learns your actions and optimizes how Ambient sound is taken and that actually could be sweet if it can learn the kind of sounds that my kids make and take that out of there worth giving them my data for 360 reality audio setup I think I'm assuming this is kind of like Apple's spatial audio optimizes 360 reality audio on your headphones for an immersive experience as if you're out of live performance okay uh note here how it says headphones so in the comments if I call these headphones don't yell at me we can accurately reproduce the best sound field for you by analyzing the shape of your weird ears where the left ear is definitely more weird than the right ear and that's me what how is that completed I haven't done any photos of my ears is this app old you just installed this app now and we're not even signed into it how does it know separately though there is head tracking and that's supported on a app by app basis as well including Netflix and YouTube but this is bunk let's just get out of here this is insane I didn't know I was going to be encountering all these new things this is talking about like not even having to touch your phone you put your your headphones into your ears and it somehow knows what kind of scene you're in and we'll just start playing music that matches that scene like you can just start jogging and it'll be like ah you're you're jogging worth maybe checking out I'm not going to try it in this video but I'm not going to be like nah to that either that's pretty cool all right I'm finally in the dashboard and one thing that's interesting right off the bat is the show as much codec you're using up there I'm using AAC I don't know if I can change it from here but I'm assuming they also have ldac which is Sony's proprietary one and then the that other one that is just part of the Bluetooth standard but cool that that's exposed up there I guess interestingly you actually have to tap to enable the battery level of the case itself and they're letting you know that they're not in constant communication with the cases battery level so you only only ever get the level that the case is at when you pulled them out oh here's that activity thing you gotta sign in for and then some kind of just like about these headphones it's a very simple system here and then in the headphone kind of page there's more tabs so let's start playing some music and mess with the controls and all that right after this message from our sponsor thanks to power color for sponsoring today's video The Red Devil RX 7900 series of gpus are optimized for 4K gaming performance are quiet and cool during long gaming sessions and can be customized with power colors devil skin swappable back plates choose between two designs for your 7900 Red Devil there's the mesh pattern generative devil skin or the sleek and smooth intrusive devil skin these bad boys are easy to install I think so a hassle-free magnetic design and they're available worldwide check out power colors devil skin GPU backplates at the link below who's listening to all this metal on here okay so now I can see music is playing right here in this app that's kind of cool I doubt I'd ever hang out in here though but maybe so you can switch tracks like that or using the earphone is it a swipe no okay I went back a track by swiping back tap is playing pause double tap his next track oh man this is not a good it's not good guys look at all these Miss clicks and stuff I gotta just learn where to tap I guess I'll go higher up okay that's consistent all right so there's a dedicated page for changing the interactions and it's really interesting what they've done here basically there's two like sets of controls and by default one set which is called Ambient sound control slash quick access is bound to the left and the other set of controls which is called playback control is bound to the right but you can actually switch it up so you could swap that so playback control is only on the left or you could duplicate it so you have playback control like so the exact same functions per earbud on both sides it would be really weird if you just put Ambient sound control on both uh because then you wouldn't have any playback control at all one thing I didn't realize is that you can tap four times to raise the volume on the right and tap four times to lower the volume in the last so I think you just you tap four times and you enter the volume control kind of Arena and you just keep tapping to to knock it down if I can just try that right now that's getting louder you kind of have to just sit here and and tap a lot but at least it's pretty intuitive it does take a while to get into that mode though these do sound really good and they've got a lot of even passive isolation let me see what happens here I think let's see what they got for ANC noise floor if I turn it on and off do I hear a hiss oh yeah there's the hiss it's not too bad so I'm gonna get my own opinion on the sound now starting with this loud thrash song I'm not a loud music listener really I could see some people thinking these aren't loud enough although it might vary by your device another thing I like to look for is whether it gets harsh sounding especially with electric guitars high-end kind of sounds like that a lot of times when you turn it up it gets just really harsh so but these but with these that doesn't seem to be a problem all right let's go into like a base Year song oh look at that auto pause pauses when you pull it out that's cool oh yeah definitely got some low rumble on the base this song is a good test track because it has like this it almost sounds like a strummed bass uh line that on top of like the kick drum it's just like this really rumbly like oh the song was big when I was first listening to the Apple airpods Max when they came out and they have like really cooked bass and the uh that Rumble was just like so apparent on those headphones more than any other first impressions though they sound pretty good but don't take my word for it we've already had the LTT Labs team run their usual battery of tests on these headphones and they've given us frequency response curves as well as a active noise canceling performance chart so let's take a look at it so the first one we have here is the frequency response starting the left side of the graph the bass response is really close to neutral then heading into you know the 100 to 1000 Hertz range you can see there's a little bit of variation but this is a two degree that's really not going to be discernible to most people even Sam the person who does the audio testing for us said that he probably wouldn't have wouldn't notice this without looking at the chart at the same time so very good very neutral response from these things so if you're the type of person who likes listening to the artist's intent from whatever content you're listening to these are going to do a good job a lot better than last year they still have problems in the upper three kilohertz and higher range is whether you're seeing more of a discrepancy up to a 10 DB discrepancy at 8 000 but this is a great improvement from the xm4s before and again at 8 000 Hertz your ears are not very good at Discerning sounds at that level so you might not really notice this 10d even the greatest difference here which is 10 DB is probably not that noticeable one thing to note though if you're coming from headphones that have a more v-shaped curve that is they're overcooked in the lows and the highs these might sound less exciting to you or less like present to you even if they sound more like neutral or true to The Artisan 10 they could sound boring to you so you have to just get used to that this is the ANC curve so here the white line is not wearing earphones at all the red line is wearing the earphones but they're not turned on so that's the passive isolation you get from just having them stuffed in your ears and then Green is having the active noise canceling turned on you can see up to 500 Hertz that is where the active noise canceling is on and it is really performing really well this is some of the best actor noise canceling that we've tested you can see the green line is well below the red line at that point and then after 500 it's basically not on so when we tested these they sat in the dummy head and we did not pull them out and put them back in between tests all we did was switch the app from ANC on and off so the difference is you see beyond 500 Hertz are really representative of the actual differences and not too many other measurement errors so do the xm5s have good active noise canceling yeah they do the microphone it is a Bluetooth microphone so it's not going to sound fabulous but I figured I would do a test call for you people and you can just hear what it sounds like be me your grandma just called you it's 4am she's an early riser you answer with these on can she even detect who the heck it is is she even gonna know it's her favorite grandson with this audio quality you be the judge so to clarify on the way that they say they improved the microphone on the buds is that they trained an algorithm on over 5 500 million voice samples so that it can recognize what your voice is and take it out from the environment noise but on top of that they also have a bone conduction kind of sensor that I'll be able to tell what's your voice from other voices so I guess we'll see if that works in the real world or not a quick little comparison here we talked about the weight before how they're uh they're newer and smaller and lighter than before and so that we're weighing 50 grounds here for the case and the buzz this is airpods Pro 56. 50 you know floods themselves 11 grams these ones 11 grams so it's actually the case that is lighter by six grams it's pretty amazing that they managed to achieve not just parody but they're smaller than the airpods case because this case is always the smallest when you compare it that's like the thing that they have that beats everybody else but somehow they finally did it and that is with uh 24 hours of battery life including the charge case eight hours continuous on the buds themselves and even though they shrunk these down the drivers inside here are actually bigger than they were before they're 8.4 millimeter drivers now instead of just six millimeter drivers on the XM Force price wise though the Sony's do cost fifty dollars more at 300 bucks airpods Pros are 250 now the comparable Bose quiet Comfort in-ears they're also 250 so you are going to be paying a premium for these but they're brand new all these other things have been out for a bit so conceivably the price will go down on these as well so overall the xm5s are definitely worth a close look they've improved the sound quality they've improved the noise canceling they've improved the size and the weight the these are just getting very close to being the best wireless earphones in the consumer Market definitely don't sleep on these put them in part of your roster if you're in that 250 to 350 dollar U.S budget for your wireless earphones they are worth a look so thanks for watching guys if you like this video hit like hit subscribe and check out some of our other earphone content we've got

Sony WF-1000XM5, hello gorgeous peeps I'm Chris from techspurt and today we're going to be reviewing the fresh juice Sony wf-1000x Mark 5 true wireless earbuds you'll be able to stuff these sexy wee Pebbles into your ear holes from August as long as you have a spare 259 pounds to Chuck at Sony so cheap they certainly ain't but are they actually worth it well I've been testing out the Sony wfx the Sony wf-1000x Mark fives for about a month now still not used to that Bloody name this is my full review and for more on the latest in greatest Tech please do POG subscribe and ding that notifications Bell cheers now first up according to Sony the x mark 5S or 25 more Compact and 20 lighter compared with the previous generation as you can see they do still poke out of your locals a wee bit but nothing horrendous these young got those dangly drippy stem things makes it look like something suspect is leaking out of your ears and they certainly are like they feel really comfortable to wear I think around five to six hours was my longest stretch without taking the buds out of my ears no worries whatsoever no fatiguing that's not helped by the fact you've got these lovely foamy tips which which kind of mold themselves to the insides of your ears doesn't feel like they're pushing on the insides of your head or anything and suddenly it's now given you four different sizes of tip including the fresh new extra small ones just in case you've got a tiny wee head as with most true wireless earbuds these days you've also got a tip test inside of Sony's headphones app just to make sure you're definitely wearing the best possible set for your lugs I just open the medium tips I found that the buds did securely lodged inside of my lugs no matter how ferociously my head was vibrating and just to prove how good that fit is mosh test and both the buds and the case itself as well constructed from recycled Plastics so good on your Sony now when it's time to connect to your smartphone or your audio streaming device of choice while it's Bluetooth 5.3 of course as you would expect from a premium pair of true wireless earbuds that means that the Sony wf-1000x Mark 5S can connect to two devices at once and I've got to say I was ridiculously impressed with the stability of that connection even though I had the streaming set to prioritize an audio quality of a performance I heard next to no stumbles or Judds or anything even when I was in absolutely packed out train stations really busy Central London locations it was so close to Flawless it was unbelievable and Sony's headphones app is as always a bit of a cracker got pretty much all the features you could possibly want packed in here so you can quickly and easily check the battery levels and here is where you can prioritize either sound quality or stability you could also choose your preferred Voice Assistant I just left this on the Google assistant and in here is also where you customize the touch controls for the wf-1000 mark fives I actually just left these on the defaults because I found it worked really well quick tap of that left bud and you can toggle the noise cancellation mode and meanwhile add all the standard media controls assigned to the right bud and Sony also offer a repeat tap function as well which I haven't seen on any other buds that I've tested and yes you do have that auto pause feature as well when you rip a butt out of your lugs quite handy if you need to have a sudden conversation with someone and that transparency mode ain't gonna cut it and personally I found the touch controls are worked well you do get tonal feedback when you're tapping and poking away so you know that you're doing it right it's all very intuitive I didn't find there was any kind of learning curve or anything and I finally didn't accidentally activate those controls at all mostly because I wasn't really fiddling with the buds because they were just comfortable to wear and with that Google Assistant activated I got the usual merryweed chime in my ear every time a new notification popped up on my smartphone but the assistant could also announce exactly who it was who was messaging me if it was in the likes of what app you can even demand that the assistant reads out your messages aloud if you can't be bothered to pull your smartphone out of your pocket or bag or whatever you can even respond to messages right there and then so it's all super simple as for sound quality well do you even really need to ask to be fair the Sony wf-1000x Mark 5S pump out premium sound with minimal Distortion thanks to the dynamic driver X Tech and that high quality DAC you've got 24-bit audio signal processors of course these sorry buds supports high-res audio wireless of course you've got ldac support and if you've got any old low quality compressed tracks where you've got Sony's digital sound enhancement engine extreme to give them a bit of a boost clear them up a bit make them sound less CAC and I would necessarily say that I'm an audio file mostly because my hearing isn't particularly great anymore these days but I really appreciated being able to hear absolutely every little tiny wee element of every single track that I played especially more complex tracks you pick up on Little Bits that you just don't hear with other buds and Diving back into that headphones app I also really like Sony's audio profiling tool which could customize the audio it spots into your head based on your own hearing abilities and just general preferences a certainly nice and easy compared with a lot of these audio profiling tools all you do is play any song of your choice that you've got on your device and then when you start the audio profiler it'll pop up five Wii circles like this just tap each one and it will slightly tweak the sound to maybe enhance the bass a bit boost the highs let's skip on top of them test them out until you find the one that you definitely prefer and then hit next just repeat this a few times and then boom you've got your very own equalizer all set up in your behalf so you can enjoy the best possible sound oh and uh if you're into your immersive 360 degree reality audio experiences while Sony has now added head track and supports to these buds too now Sony is marketing the wf-1000xm5s as the best noise canceling true wireless earbuds and of course these Sony buds are renowned for been absolutely fantastic when it comes to cutting out all the crap that's going on all around you you got three mics on board These suck up all of that ambient noise and then you've got the integrated processor V2 as well as HD noise canceling processor qn2e which tick in all this data and then work their magic these processes then feed that data to Sony's Dynamic driver X which then produces the noise canceling waves there's loads of techie Jog and bollocks there but does it actually work and is it improved here on the mark fives well first of all those form tips are doing a lot of the work themselves as I said before they sort of mold themselves to fit the shape of your inner ear really have to block out a lot of the noise that's going on all around you but then when you knock on that ENC it has an extra impact on top leaving you in complete peace and bliss now don't get me wrong these buds can't work miracles they can't completely dampen out That Hideous screeching of the [ __ ] Northern line for instance but they can make it considerably more bearable which is good enough and so certainly is the best ENT that I've personally tested on any pair a true wireless earbuds if you fancy listed to a quiet podcast where you're sat next to a Motorway that is perfectly possible and also trains at all the usual fare as well they really help to cut down on the The Rumble the vibration so ideal for commuting and for traveling in general haven't had a chance to test them out in plane yet but hopefully that's coming soon and I found that there was next to no wind feedback at all as well so ideal if you live somewhere a bit Gusty or if you want a pair of true wireless earbuds to a rocking your ears while you're doing a bit of jogging or whatever and the Sony wf-1000 etc etc also boss improved call Quality thanks to those noise canceling smarts as you can hear the buds can clearly pick up on your voice helped by the born conduction sensor which actually knows when it's used Beacon and not somebody else nearby and the buds can then separate you from all live background bollocks but of course I'm just chatting away in assignment studio right now let's get some really loud obnoxious traffic sounds on the go and see how it fares with that okay so I'm now simulating being on a very busy High Street with lots of traffic trucks worn by a lot of angry porn honk and all that good stuff and as you can hear these Sony true wireless earbuds can still clearly and clearly pick up on my voice whichever unfortunate saw on busy chat and I can still hear exactly what I'm seeing so let's finish up this lovely Wii review of the Sony wf-1000x Mark 5s with a chat about the battery life and so many reckons you'll get around eight hours of use from these buds from a full charge and that is with the noise canceling switched on and I found in my personal test and that it wasn't far off but I tend to get just over seven hours from each of these buds on one occasion randomly the right bud did drain a lot faster than the left buds that died after more like five and a half six hours but that seemed to be a one-off touchwood thankfully probably just some quirky wee bug because I was of course reviewing these Sony buds pre-release yeah seven hours is a banging result for some true wireless earbuds and certainly great news if you do find yourself going on Long Journeys as for the case well that is proper we as I said before easy to slip into any pocket bag whatever when you're done with your buds or they do need a charge just pop them straight back in there you got the usual magnetic connection which holds them in there reasonably firmly I haven't had any problems with them popping out and flying across the floor or anything and check them in there for just about sort of four or five minutes you'll easily get a full hour of playback however one of the drawbacks of having such a diminutive case is the fact that the battery stuffed inside isn't exactly massive so you will only get around two full recharges of the buds before the case itself needs juicing up as well which thankfully you can either use type c USB otherwise it does charge wirelessly and there you have it my lovelies that is my full final Frank review of the Sony wf-1000 X Mark 5 true wireless earbuds after I've been tested them for around a month and I gotta say obviously I love them the design is slick the sound quality is fantastic and the noise cancellation well frankly Sony isn't [ __ ] about here it really is the best that I've personally tested at least in a pair of true wireless earbuds but the only real drawback for me is the fact that they're pretty bloody expensive 250-ish Queen not exactly affordable unless you're able to wipe your ass with 50 pound notes and if you're really tempted by the Sony's but you can't stretch to that sort of budget well you've got the likes of the Sound Cores which I recently reviewed which cost around 100 pounds just under and they still offer strong audio quality good noise cancellation they're not quite the same full range of features as the Sony's but pretty bloody close anyway that's what this ball Noble reckons what do you guys think I attempted by the Sony's or maybe you're watching this video a couple of months in the future you've actually got your own pair and you're absolutely loving them or not so much definitely check your review down in the comments below please do pork subscribe and ding that notifications Bell for more on the list and greatest Tech and have yourselves a really wonderful rest of the week cheers everyone love you [Music] thank you
Sony WF-1000XM5, how important to you are your wireless earbuds do you really know I thought I did but I mean if you lost them would you miss them a ton would you run out and replace them with the same model or would you maybe upgrade how much are you willing to spend on earbuds and what does any of this have to do with the new Sony wf-1000xm5 stick around and find out [Music] welcome back everyone I'm Caleb Dennison and I have a few stories for you today but they all tie into my review of the Sony wf-1000xm5 wireless noise canceling earbuds so to start from now on I'm just going to call them the xm5 and I'm gonna have to trust that you know I'm referring to these xm5s not these xm5s yeah Sony's model naming convention is another story but I'm afraid we don't have time for that right now before I go on if you're new around here welcome also if you're used to seeing TVs when you see my face well I also do earbuds and headphones and sound bars and slay dragons so sit back relax maybe grab a beverage and hey if you like what you learned today consider clicking some buttons of support that would also include shopping links in the description if you decide to buy anything that you see on this channel thanks a bunch okay the xm5 I'm going to tell a story later that explains why I'm just now reviewing these even though I've had them for a few weeks and they were announced a while ago so stick around for that but for now another story you may have seen me on this Channel singing the Praises of the Apple airpods Pro Gen 2 which I must admit is not a very Caleb thing to do but my take on the airpods pro Gen 2 is that they may not be the absolute best in a number of areas like sound quality battery life noise canceling call Quality but they are really good at all of those things plus they offer some specific appeal to those of us who own Apple devices I don't use a Macbook personally but I do use an iPad iPhone and Apple tv pretty frequently so for me the airpods pro gen into have been my default earbud my daily driver there fine I enjoy using them but I also really enjoy using other earbuds as well I'm lucky to get to try a bunch out and I can really appreciate the fun features of a set of jabras or the incredible sound quality of a set of sennheisers but when it comes to Sony earbuds I wasn't a big fan of the buds that these xm5s replaced that would be the xm4 Mostly because they were too bulky for me I think they were too bulky for a lot of people they sounded great and the noise canceling was excellent but the bulk kept me away from them actually it was the Sony linkbuds S that I fell in love with I didn't see that coming they didn't have noise canceling quite as good as the xm4 and the sound quality also wasn't quite on par with the xm4 but man they were comfortable and low profile I feel like they disappeared into my ears as well as any earbud could and they never fell out I didn't need to adjust them a bunch I just I found myself using them all the time so you can imagine my disappointment when I lost them yep of the almost 100 earbuds that I've tested and used I've never lost any of them until the link buds S I was super bummed I thought about buying another pair of those but ultimately I figured you know what Sony is going to come out with something new soon and I'll give those a go that would be these the xm5 and they are almost exactly what I was hoping for all the sound quality and noise canceling power of the xm4 in a form factor more like the link buds s that I love more compact for sure but not quite as comfortable or low profile as the link buds s so why tell you my little lost earbuds sob story well because wireless earbuds are now incredibly common they are practically a commodity there are a ton of options to choose from and in fact some of them are surprisingly affordable take the anchor Liberty 4 NC for example 100 bucks and they do everything awesome but you know what I'm not gonna buy those because I don't like the stem style earbud it's just not for me the airpods pro Gen 2 that stem is the one thing I don't really care for but I'm able to overlook it some folks love that look on the airpods pro gen 2. I know it's almost become sort of a status symbol but frankly it's just not for me so if you're like me you will pay a bit more to get exactly what you want as long as what you are getting is indeed exactly what you want and xm5 are going to be exactly what a lot of folks want why well in the most simplest of terms this is going to be a huge review Redux okay the xm5 are everything you'd love about the xm4 and nothing you didn't love class leading sound quality class leading noise canceling class leading Voice or call Quality excellent battery life it's all here but in more compact attractive and comfortable package so the new xm5 are an easy 9 out of 10 for me with that said I don't think they're going to be for everyone especially if you have smaller ears because despite being more Compact and more like just a button that you put in your ear they are still just a tad bit bulky I still miss the link buds S size and shape maybe all the tech that are in the xm5 can't go in a package that's small yet I get it but the xm5 are a bit bigger than the link buds s and for me don't stay perfectly seated at all times with no adjustment necessary so those are the only reasons these don't get a perfect 10. I think what really stands out about the xm5 here is the call Quality from the Fidelity of your voice to the background noise canceling these tests did better than the airpods pro gen 2. I took a call with Simon Cohen my buddy that does most of our earbuds and headphone reviews and the xm5 were the clear winner not sure I can duplicate that for you here but I'm going to try using iPhone's voice memo app so here's what the airpods pro Gen 2 sound like inside with no real background noise it's probably a fairly familiar sound though they may be getting a little bit of a boost since I'm using them with an iPhone and these are the Sony xm5 now indoors we found the xm5 had better voice Fidelity on the whole but when I step outside into the noise it's a slightly different story okay so this is a sound you're probably familiar with these are the airpods pro gen 2. there's nothing wrong with them I imagine that you can hear me just fine and a lot of the background noise at this busy intersection is probably being tamped down on quite a bit but watch what happens when I switch to the xm5 okay so I've switched to the Sony xm5 and I don't know exactly what my iPhone's voice recorder is going to capture but hopefully you get a good feel for the difference in the Fidelity between the airpods Pro 2 and the xm5 also hopefully we get a little bit of a different sense for what kind of background noise cancellation is happening right now there is certainly plenty of noise happening around me right now but the ultimate test is about to happen I'm about to take a uh a video conference meeting here on this corner like in 30 seconds so I'll let you know how that goes I'll see you in just a second so as you probably heard while the voice Fidelity takes a little bit of a hit outside with lots of noise to cancel the xm5 do a much better job hiding my surroundings from the collar on the other end of the line I took that meeting out there and nobody had any idea I wasn't sitting right here the whole time I think that's a pretty great endorsement oh also wind noise it's not a worry with the xm5 I had 20 mile per hour gusts coming at me when I spoke to Simon and he couldn't hear a thing out of the ordinary as for noise canceling I used the xm5 on a flight out to the east coast and back a couple of weeks ago and the ANC was outstanding when I played movies or music sick I couldn't hear anything else and if you want to take a nap with these in your ears no problem they are just low profile enough not to bother your ear if you lean it against a pillow or a bulkhead I don't think I would wear them to bed all the time but if you're just beat you can definitely quiet things down and grab yourself a nap the sound quality for music and movies is excellent it's very much in line with Sony's XM series of full-size headphones just more in your head so to speak I still think Sennheiser has an edge in the sound quality department for audiophiles but I would never balk at the xm5 earbuds they sound excellent now I'm gonna intentionally gloss over a ton of features that Sony builds into its best headphones all accessible and manageable through its headphones app yes you can have them adapt the ANC to match what you're doing so if you're sitting still you get full ANC if you're walking around downtown they back off the ANC so that you can hear any danger coming around the corner they also have a feature that when you speak will pause the music and put the buds into transparency mode and it works better than ever you can see me using it right here when I'm buying some plants and that face you're seeing right there is me freaking out over a hundred and eighteen dollars for these two plants yikes anyway my lawnmower and vacuum used to trigger this feature which was frustrating because that's when I wanted the ANC and music the most but now the software seems to be better trained to detect the voice and not just loud sounds coming at them my only complaint is that if you already have your music paused and transparency mode is on the earbuds still do this annoying chime to let you know they're going into speaking mode but you know what there are more annoying things in life the xm5's transparency mode by the way is just fine it is not as good as apples which is the closest thing I've heard to not wearing earbuds or headphones at all but to be fair nobody can compete with Apple's transparency mode the xm5 are as good as any other competitor out there probably a little bit better so guys I think the xm5 are for anyone who does a lot of travel a lot of phone calls especially for business and wants really great sound quality as well someone who wants the best of the best and is willing to pay a premium for something that's going to last a long time and not be outclassed by another product the very next year now if you find some of what I'm saying surprising because you have seen less glowing reviews elsewhere well understand this the first round of reviews you may have watched or read on these earbuds were of prototypes they were not based on the final version of these earbuds Sony kind of made a gaff and sent a bunch of prototypes out to reviewers and didn't mention that they were prototypes so a lot of reviewers didn't even know until they got a little note from Sony along with some replacement buds probably don't have to tell you not Sony's finest hour but now that the final version is out and I've been able to test these earbuds for a while I'm confident in saying they are among the very best you can buy they ask a premium price but they deliver an experience that's Head and Shoulders above most of the competition you definitely get what you pay for and then some I strongly recommend them especially if you're discovering that your earbuds are far more important to you than you previously thought thanks as always for watching everyone what do you think of the xm5 are there some other earbuds you'd like for me to review let me know down in the comments please consider liking and subscribing I'll see you on the next one and until then here's two other videos I think you might like [Music]
Sony WF-1000XM5, so these are the brand new Sony wf-1000 xm5s terrible name so I'm just going to call them the xm5s and they've improved a lot with this new version compared to its old predecessor I think the best way to do this review is to compare it to the old xm4s add a little airpods Pro in there for contacts and same with the Beats fit Pro because I feel like that's the best way to kind of describe how these things function now right off the gate form factor they've absolutely nailed it it's a much smaller design in fact the actual case is about 15 smaller compared to the previous version you can tell automatically when I have them beside each other that it's not as thick and it's not as wide on top of that the earbuds which is probably the biggest change are 25 percent smaller compared to the previous version I don't know if you guys remember but the xm4s are super chunky when these things are in your ear it's literally like a growth sticking out the side of them the new versions just look a lot better not only are they smaller but they are also about 15 percent lighter so when you're wearing these things for long periods of time it's going to feel a lot more comfortable to wear but yeah big difference in terms of overall design now the case has had a few changes as well for example the front light on the old version is a long one and then on the new version It's a tiny little circle which tells you whether or not the headphones are charging or if they need to be charged also there's a little button on the back now which was something that wasn't present before so you can long press this and you can pair it to your phone whereas with the previous version you had to touch the sides of the earbuds in order to pair it with your device now obviously there's some technological updates to the new version they have this new dual core processor there's six microphones so it's going to be doing a better job of scanning the actual environment in order to provide active noise cancellation but they've also included an extra pair of ear tips in the Box you now get an extra small option in case you have really tiny earlobes that will fit those earlobes significantly better now here's a weird thing about these guys they are definitely a little bit more comfortable to wear but I do find that they're a bit more finicky when I was putting them in my ear and this really comes down to active noise cancellation with the older versions because they were so thick and they had this weird shape that kind of would I don't know rest in my earlobe I found that they weren't as finicky with active noise cancellation so even if the actual tip wasn't all the way in I could still get a decent active noise cancellation experience with the new version you have to stick them all the way in like I mean all the way in the seal has to be perfect or you will lose the effect of active noise cancellation whereas something like the airpods pro or even the Beats fits Pro if it's not all the way in I'm still going to get a good response from active noise cancellation and this is the weird thing okay active noise cancellation is supposed to be better on these new xm5s but I found them to be kind of equal to the xm4s I'm not seeing that much of an actual Improvement in fact out of all these buds on the table I still find that the airpods pro have the best active noise cancellation out of all four of these now if you're coming from the xm4 is you're going to be very familiar with how you control these earbuds the left earbud allows you to press it once if you want to cycle through active noise cancellation Ambient sound or turning them off if you tap it twice or three times you can access one of your quick access settings that you set up using your smartphone the Sony app will let you pair it to let's say Spotify for example if you want to load it up then if you tap it four times on the left hand side it will lower the volume once on the right earbud you have access to play and pause you tap it once to pause or pick up a call tap it twice to skip a song tap it three times to go back and then if you long press it you can access your assistant and if you tap it four times you can bring the volume up so identical I'm not the biggest fan of tapping it four times to increase the volume that's kind of very slow if you want want to increase the sound I'd rather just pull out my phone at that point but at least you have the option to do so the drivers have been improved the old xm4s had six millimeter drivers these ones have been bumped up to 8.4 and I think that's where these things Excel the most out of all these headphones on the table now don't get me wrong the old xm4s have great sound like they sound good but I found them to be the flattest out of the bunch not in a bad way but they were flatter than the other two and of course you could always equalize these tier tastes using the Sony app but right out of the box these xm5s had the best sound the airpods pro had probably put them in a very close second but these new 8.4 millimeter drivers definitely make a difference the other big thing that Sony was talking about was the Improvement to the microphones there are six microphones inside of here so not only that can have an advantage to basically helping with the environment in terms of scanning it to provide a better active noise cancellation experience but it's supposed to improve the actual voice quality so you guys let me know how these sound compared to the others in the comment section down below right now you're listening to the Sony wf-1000xm5s I do have the air conditioning blasting in the background which is very loud let me know if you guys can hear it also let me know how the sound quality compares to the other headsets that you hear in this video now you're listening to the airpods pro this is what the microphone sounds like with the airpods pro air conditioned still blasting let me know how the noise cancellation is on that but yeah now you're listening to the airpods pro and last up we have the Sony xm4s these are the older uh wireless headphones from Sony you guys let me know how the microphone quality is compared to the xm5s and more importantly whether or not you can hear the air conditioned blasting in the background now in terms of water resistance these are ipx4 so you can get splashes on them but you know you obviously can't soak these in a pool they will not work after a while but it is able to wirelessly charge just like the previous version they wirelessly charge by standing up where as with the airpods pro you have to lie it on its back so that's the only difference but just like the previous versions you can wirelessly charge the device in terms of actual battery life it's identical to the previous model you're going to get up to eight hours of use before needing to charge but the case will provide you up to 24 hours the only difference is that if you charge these for three minutes you'll get one hour of playback whereas with the previous xm4 you have to charge them for five minutes now I know one of the questions I'm going to get is are these headphones good for working out and personally I don't think they are I went to the gym with them I ran with them and because they don't have the little tips that the Beats fit Pro have I found that they had a tougher time staying in my ear and this was mostly true when I started sweating a lot because I run pretty far not pretty far at least far from me and after a while I'm sweating and I found that I was constantly adjusting these in my ear to stay in place now in all fairness this happened with the xm4s and it also happens with the airpods pro for my specific ear type I gotta have these tips or like the Powerbeats Pro where they kind of wrap around your ear so the big question should you buy the Sony xm5s look I like these things a lot they nailed the sound quality I find them to be the best out of the bunch but the active noise cancellation is not nearly as good as the airpods pro or even the Beats fits Pro for that matter and the Beats fits Pro work with both IOS and Android perfectly but the thing is this is priced at 299 that's more expensive than the Beats fit Pro and that's 50 more expensive than the airpods pro and I don't feel like these things are 50 dollars better my suggestion to you is to wait till these things go on sale before picking them up because right now they're priced a little bit too high and that's too bad because these are actually a very solid pick especially because the sound quality is really really good if you have any more questions let me know in the comment section down below like the video if you haven't already and I'll see you guys in the next one
Sony WF-1000XM5, if you don't have time to watch a full review don't worry because we've got you covered and in this video we're going to tell you everything you need to know about the Sony wf-1000xm5 in five minutes first thing you need to know about these earbuds is that they are a lot more comfortable than the wf-1000xm4 not only are these smaller and lighter than its predecessor but it's only has also redesigned the internal structure of the ear tips and now that the ear tips are more flexible you don't have to jam and twist the earbuds into your ear to get a secure fit or a proper seal oh and if you got extra small ears don't worry because Sony has finally okay I lost them but Sony has finally included extra small ear tips for extra small ears so good for you wait why didn't we why did we pick a gray carpet and why did they send us the gray color along with the new ear tips comes improved isolation and on top of that the xm5 the earbuds now feature the best ANC performance out of any true Wireless earbud we have ever tested that's right according to our extensive objective testing process the xm5 earbuds do have better ANC performance than the xm4s the airpods pro Gen 2 and even the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro and if you want to see our full measurements then stay tuned for our ultimate review of the Sony wf-1000xm5 but if you're impatient then you can keep our results at soundguys.com now the xm5 earbuds also include improved touch controls that's right in the previous generation you had to choose between controlling either listening mode toggle or volume control in one earbud for the xm5 Sony has pulled a Hannah Montana and of giving you the best of both worlds meaning that you can control both listening modes and volume just from one earbud and you don't have to go into the app to customize the controls now the full list of touch control patterns are going to be available on our website or in this freeze frame in three two one speaking of customization like with most if not all Sony audio products the xm5s have great app support via the Sony headphones Connect app now downloading the app is key for getting firmware updates but it is also important for unlocking a lot of the earbuds features like adaptive sound control Ambient sound control DSE Extreme Audio upscaling and you're also going to need the app if you want to use Sony 360 reality audio which is the company's proprietary spatial audio technology next thing you need to know about the xm5s is that they've got great battery life now Sony claims that you can get eight hours on a single charge in up to 24 hours with a charging case but from our testing the xm5s actually exceeded Sony's claims and provided us with 9 hours and 32 minutes of playback that's enough battery life for a transatlantic flight between New York and London and you would still have extra battery for when you land in London the headphones also come with quick charging worth just three minutes of charging will give you about an hour's worth of playback now from our tests the three minute quick charging got us closer to 50 minutes of playback time which is still not bad if you need your earbuds for a quick workout now people complain that the xm4 has had too much bass emphasis and unfortunately the story isn't any better with the xm5s from hard testing the xm5s actually had a higher emphasis in the mid bass region which is why it sounds like cellos kick drums and bass since might sound a little louder than you'd expect and if you're a fan of EDM or hip-hop or you're someone like me who enjoys a little extra bass when pushing B then you're gonna love the xm5 but for those who prefer a little less low end then I recommend going into the headphones Connect app and turning down the clear bass slider in the EQ by a few notches now Sony also claims that the xm5's microphones is the best that's ever included in a pair of true wireless earbuds now this is apparently thanks to the six micro A3 per each side and also through a combination of AI processing and bone conduction technology which should provide better voice detection and therefore better filtering of outside noise while you're on a call unfortunately we were not able to properly test that because we were given a pre-production unit and the microphone on this one one is not good but we will be getting a production unit soon to test so again if you want to see our full mic test be sure to stay tuned for our ultimate review coming soon now if you own the wf-1000xm4 you're probably wondering should you upgrade to the xm5 well if you were someone like me who found the fit of the xm4 very uncomfortable then yes by all means upgrading the xm5 is a good idea but if you're thinking about upgrading based on sound quality or ANC performance I would hold off just because of how much an upgrade would cost you more on that later but you're probably also wondering are these any better than the airpods pro Gen 2 the answer is yes the xm5s do feature better ANC performance better software customization support and it plays nicely with Android devices but if you want the best out of the box sound quality and you want the most comfortable fit and you're an Apple user then yeah I'd actually still recommend the airpods pro Gen 2 over the xm5 and if you want to get your hands on the Sony wf-1000xm5 it will cost you around 300 US dollars to get these buds which is is quite a lot of cheddar for a pair of true Wireless noise canceling earbuds in fact at this price point the xm5s are more expensive than the airpods pro Gen 2 Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro and even the Google pixel buds Pro otherwise if you are looking for one of the best active noise cancellation true wireless earbuds then you won't be disappointed with the Sony wf-1000xm5 and that is time okay we did it that's pretty much it well if you enjoyed the format make sure to let us know in the comments down below or like and if you really did like the format make sure to hit like subscribe and I will see you guys in the next video happy listening
Sony WF-1000XM5, as an audio engineer with over 16 years of experience mixing for concerts bands and events my goal and responsibility is to make the most insane audio review on all of YouTube so this is a definitive and experiential comparison of the Sony wf-1000xm5s the Sony wf-1000xm Force the Apple airpods Pro 2 and the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too and it's measured and captured with over five thousand dollars of high-end professional equipment that covers the entire human hearing range to help you make the best choice for your preferences now since this is an experiential and immersive review you'll want to make sure that you're wearing earbuds or headphones in both ears in order to get the full experience so I'll let you do that before we continue now these high quality recordings will not magically transform your listening device to them but they do provide the comparative differences between all of them for ANC transparency mode gaming performance call Quality and microphone quality in various situations and will listen to a variety of different musical styles I'll even let you hear my custom EQ settings for the Sony xm5s which you can gain access to by becoming a channel member so let's hear some of what it sounds like if you're wearing these earbuds and listening to music and each test in this video will start and end with the original reference track and then cycle through each earbud you'll see which earbud you're listening to by looking in the label up top foreign [Music] [Music] by the way just so you understand the flow of this video we'll listen to a song sample between each section of this video there are also chapters available so you can easily find your way around I promise that you'll come away feeling confident about which option is the best fit for your preferences of course if you want to purchase any of these there'll be links Down Below in the description and it does help support the channel if you use those links now if you're wondering why I'm emphasizing the xm5 so much it's not because I'm biased it's because it's the new thing at the time of filming so chill out for the song listen to the Reverb for the vocals the snare the sharpness of the hi-hat and the stereo spread from the Wawa sounds and let me know in the comments what you notice [Applause] [Music] you guys [Music] Sony has recently moved towards more sustainable materials and shrieking down the size of their products which we first started to see with the Sony link buds s this is a nice change from the massive wf-1000xm3s of the past they even managed to be even smaller than the xm4's case and slightly bigger than the linkbud's S case amongst the four the Apple airpods Pro 2 are the smallest with the Bose QuietComfort earbuds 2 being the largest I do really like the texture and feel of the xm5s but just a heads up that the case is prone to scuffs and marks but so far I've been able to wipe them off you may not see this as much on the black model but the black model will show more fingerprints so I prefer the silver or white color the xm5 also adds a pairing button to the case which the xm4 lacked which is definitely appreciated the airpods Pro 2 case is a bit more feature-rich because it has a speaker inside of it that can provide audible feedback and sounds so if you lose them and are looking for them that can come in handy it also has an air tag built into it so you can use the find my network to locate it one thing that I don't particularly like is how the earbuds themselves are partially glossy strangely the xm5s are insanely slippery and hard to get out of the case actually dropped it oh there you go a slippery little Goose but I got it while the airpods Pro 2 are glossy the earbuds are super easy to take out because you push from the back to take it out it's so easy that can just open it up without even looking grab it and put it in my ear on the xm5s this motion doesn't seem to be the intended motion nor does it work well because there's nothing to grip on now as you can see the xm5s are a little bit bigger than the bulb part of the airpods Pro 2 but notably smaller than the xm4s and the Bose QuietComfort earbuds too now this is not only obvious visually but also in your ear and how they feel now they feel pretty comfortable for me so that's my personal experience but my ears are not the same as yours the xm4s feel massive in your ears in comparison to the rest the Bose feel super secure because of the extra fins the airpods Pro 2 surprisingly feel like they're not in your ears without falling out and the xm5s feel secure while being very comfortable but it's important to know that it's mostly relying on the ear tip to hold it in for working out all of them are ipx4 rated I think the bows are the most secure option out of all of them but I haven't found any issues with any of the others in terms of feeling like they fall out or them actually falling out now having the proper size ear tip is important not only for the sound but to keep it secured in your ear the xm5s joined the trend of having an extra small ear tip and are made out of a really nice foam-like material rather than silicone so it not only provides a more snug fit but also a stronger passive noise cancellation unfortunately the xm5 stick out of my ear enough to make it uncomfortable to lay down on a pillow strangely though the airpods Pro 2 are quite comfortable when laying down even with that stem at least for my ears for the song pay attention to the clarity of the attack of the acoustic guitar strings but how Ford the mid-range is in the body of the guitar and the vocals when the nights get cold sometimes when I look over see you by a fire with your hands out in the open and I wonder if you're singing Autumn's song but if I'm singing all I must be singing on my own [Music] oh look we're in the maxim5 how weird as for battery life here's a helpful chart to look at that will show you that they're pretty much all the same with the airpods pro having the largest overall battery life and the Sony's having the longest per charge battery life as a whole all of them are at least long enough for a long flight with ANC on or to get through most of a workday and they have been fairly accurate in my actual use I honestly have no complaints about any of their battery lives all these charge quickly but the xm5s can get you an hour of playback time with a three minute charge compared to the xm4's 5 minutes and all but the airpods Pro 2 use USBC at the time of filming there have been some rumors that the airpods Pro 2 will have a refresh to swap out the lightning port for USBC so if that's true and you're watching that and it has been released how do you like it let me know in the comments hello you from the future in addition to charging over a cable all of them have wireless charging except for the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too this is a bit of a frustrating Omission given that it is a flagship earbud from Bose and they have the largest case with the airpods Pro 2 it benefits from magsafe and will likely benefit from the qi2 charging standard coming in 2024 and that includes magnets that are essentially magsafe that means it will be compatible with a lot of wireless charging accessories that will be released in 2024 and Beyond hey by the way if you found this video valuable and want to help support the making of more of them the super thanks feature is enabled it's like giving you a tip thanks this track is quite revealing in how the mid-range is handled between each earbud as well as how it handles some of the higher end things like symbols in the snare pay attention to see if you hear one of them being a bit harsher than the other hold it to the night [Music] [Applause] [Music] for the xm5s interactions are mostly the same with the addition of a four tap feature to either turn your volume up or down which is greatly appreciated I think volume control is a make or break for me there are options for adjusting which earbud handles Ambient sound control and which handles playback control in the app unfortunately it doesn't allow you to assign custom actions for each type of tab so you're stuck with predefined presets overall I'm happy with the interactions on the xm5s but I prefer the swipe gestures found on the airpods Pro 2 and the Bose QuietComfort earbuds too which allow for swipe volume controls up and down on each earbud it just feels more intuitive over Taps and it's nicer for those of us that wear one earbud at a time as for connectivity the airpods Pro 2 are obviously amazing for Apple devices with quick pair and the Sony earbuds connect over Android fast pair and support the higher quality ldac codec on Android and Bose requires an app to work properly I will say that the Bose app is the worst part of that earbud because it's so inconsistent doesn't always work and it won't let you connect at times so Bose needs a fixed repairing process and connectivity and use Android fast here the xm5s have 85 percent of the features available just from connecting over Bluetooth and the interactions so the app isn't required for a good experience but the headphone app is essentially the same as before with ANC and transparency controls EQ adaptive sound controls based on what you're doing speak of the chat which will auto switch to transparency mode when it detects your voice and back to ANC when you stop talking a new head gesture feature which you cannot to accept a call or shake your head to reject it interesting there's also Multi-Device pairing which works fantastically well and there's a bunch more as a whole the Sony app is solid but wish I had more custom EQ bands beyond the five given for people like me as well as more granular controls for interactions I also would like more side tone control or the capture voice during a phone call feature that is intended to prevent you from feeling all plugged up into your head isolated from when you're talking on a call right now it doesn't feel like it's doing nearly enough to alleviate this sensation speaking of calls and microphones let's check that out after this next song this song is a mid-ranging warm and Soulful track listen to her vocals the electric guitar lines and the keyboard okay and together [Music] [Applause] [Music] in your mouth [Music] now let's test out how the microphones perform inside where it's quiet and outside in noisier areas anyways we'll also check out the call Quality experience and to help financially support videos like this I'll test out the mics while telling you how you can support me now I don't have a sponsor for this video because a whole bunch of Brands pass on it which I just have a feeling a lot of them will wish they had you can still help support videos like this that take me over 60 hours to make by checking out the service that I personally use called delete me I had a pretty scary experience a year or so ago where I was live streaming and someone started to share personal information about me in the chat and even started to share details of where I live I thought I was about to be swatted which terrified me it was one of the most violating feelings I've ever had and I just proactively called the police to let them know what's happening to try to you know prevent anything from happening they said that they would have to show up regardless if someone was to report something so I was a bit anxious but thankfully nothing happened and after that I made sure that it would never happen again you see I had this previous job at JP Morgan Chase in the fraud prevention department and my job was to find information on people let me tell you there's way too much information out there about you if you've opened up a phone plan about a house voted opening utility plan or numerous other things your information is out there here's the crazy part public information is way too public in the age of the internet I could easily find out someone's current and previous address their phone number family members age and More in as little as five minutes with only two pieces of information about you like your name and what city you live in so what's the solution well first we need some serious reform in regards to public information and second you can easily remove all that information with delete me it provides all the information that you provide and yes it is safe and then it uses that information and looks all over the Internet for those who are selling your information and sharing it and request that it's removed every single three months I tell my family and friends to use it my fellow content creators and I'm telling you that you should use it too I've been using it for the past year and I can't even find my personal information on the internet and I'm me it was my job to find people if you sign up with you'll get 20 percent off a plan and I'll get a little commission to help compensate for my lack of sponsors and here's a tip sign up for the two-year plan to extend that discount even longer that's what I did so help a brother out sign up and protect yourself your friends and your family using the link in the description or the QR code on the screen thanks to the real ones who signed up shared my link and helped support videos like this by the way all these phone calls were HD phone calls now we're next to a waterfallon which provides a lot of noise that the mics will have to filter out to focus on your voice how does it sound on the Bose now Sony told me that they added an AI chip and some sensors into the xm5s to tell when you're talking and this is based on the vibrations that it detects while you're talking and then that AI chip processes all that crazy stuff so in theory that means it should be able to filter out your external noise and capture the sound of your voice better so how do you do it and now we're next to a busy road as if you're walking to work I'm running things to say if I want to let you know that I'm really thankful that you're here I hope you're having a good day and that you're enjoying the video so far and that providing a lot of value here if it is let me know what you think in the comments I'll let you notice about each of the microphones and how they perform no this song has a lot of frequencies going everywhere so listen to how the high end and the mid-range changes between earbuds foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] generally using bluetooth earbuds isn't the best idea for games especially first person shooters or rocket League or you know things like that but they can be perfectly fine for most other games Sony has stated that they have improved their latency on the xm5s which is true but still has a bit of a delay the Bose is the worst in terms of latency and the airpods Pro 2 on an iPhone performs the best for this next song listen to the low end and the high end From The Snare and especially the hi-hats to hear how bright and sharp the high ends [Music] what's going on [Music] transparency mode is an extremely helpful feature that allows you to be aware of and engage with your surroundings without having to take out your earbuds and every one of these have varying levels of quality and can be enabled by a touch of a button an adjustment in the app or automatically enables when you talk like on the xm5s transparency has been a very exciting area of improvement over the last year with the launch of the airpods Pro 2 and the Bose quiet Comfort earbuds too these two have been the best options out there for transparency due to how natural they sound the question is how do they stack up with each other and how does the xm5 compare so we have some very fancy microphones here each one of these mice is a thousand dollars so you'll actually be able to hear how it sounds in terms of the transparency performance and the ANC performance compared to just saying hey it sounds good or sounds bad we'll be able to have some objective samples of how they're actually performing in different environments which is really cool okay let's do a transparency test right next to this water fountain foreign [Music] foreign [Music] okay now we're next to this busy road so let's see how it performs [Music] [Applause] [Music] now what's really interesting about transparency mode on the Bose QuietComfort earbuds 2 and the airpods Pro 2 is that the sound of your environment when you have in your ear kind of sounds a lot like the same as when you take it out there's no audible difference in volume there which is really convenient it adds to that really natural experience for transparency mode this song is from my personal friend Hannah Parrott listen to how Dynamic the track sounds the various layers of horns string sections and malloc percussion instruments [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you for many years Sony has been amongst the best out there for ANC or active noise cancellation going neck and neck with other brands like Bose and Apple so this test will be really fun to check out now for the ANC test we're next to this wire phone let's see how they perform [Music] now not all ANC is the same sometimes it's just a marketing point and it doesn't really do much or it does a lot and it's really effective like the options that we have in this video and some of them have different approaches some may focus more on the mid-range reduction which is where your voice tends to kind of reside or we'll focus more on the high end where you have a lot of ambient noise or things like water running so it really comes down to your personal preference and the approach that you prefer all right now we're out in an open field where there's a bunch of white noise and so we're going to try out the transparency mode and we have my friend Sydney over here that's going to help out with some of the talking samples hey oh listen to how each handles win how much of the voice you can hear in a and C mode and how clear and natural The Voice Sounds in transparency mode what's up Sydney what's going on Brandon aren't we like in Rome or something we are almost like Rome but not as cool Sydney have you ever seen the Bose quite go for earbuds too no this is actually my first time seeing these bad boys do you think uh it's kind of weird with the stubbies oh yeah it's like give me a thumbs up Sydney what do you think about the design of the xm5s I love it uh it's cool it's you know what I'm more fascinated with than the xm5s is just your entire testing setup you're you know it's classic you oh thanks you're a classy guy now the song is covered with a wide range of frequencies so listen to the high end and the mid-range for how it changes between earbuds [Music] ways [Music] now as you've probably noticed I haven't really shared a lot of my thoughts on the sound quality that's to give you more time to hear for yourself the objective samples and make your own conclusions but I know a lot of you want to hear my personal thoughts so here they are the Sony wf-1000xm5s really surprised me at first listen they sound good typically Sony's go for a very dark bass heavy sound that some have described as feeling like you're under a thick blanket this is not the case here the xm5s may be Sony's most balanced sounding wireless earbuds today avoiding the much darker and more congested Bassy sound that was found on the wf-1000xm4s it is still a bit more mellow and less Airy than the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too in the airpods Pro 2 which some may prefer however it doesn't sound so mellow that becomes boring or muffled I assume you've been able to hear these differences in the song samples amongst the lineup the airpods Pro 2 are a bit closer to the standard called the harman curve that provides a Target sound that most people tend to prefer according to harman's research I tend to prefer a Harmon sound with some minor modifications so the airpods Pro 2 have been my preference for a while for wireless bluetooth earbuds but that changes with xm5s plus my custom EQ now the Sony headphones app does have an interesting feature that gives you the ability to create a custom EQ based upon some predetermined sound so you kind of tap around and choose what option you prefer and it continually narrows it down until you get a custom EQ personally I didn't really like the results of those but thankfully there is a five band EQ option that you can mainly arrange to get a more granular choice for you so I prefer that one a little bit more now speaking of custom EQ let me share with you my own after this song this song has a lot of Reverb going on listen to how forward the vocal sound the air and the Reverb from the vocals and how clean the low end sounds and let me know what you notice in the comments [Music] I need [Music] foreign [Music] with my custom EQ I still have to take the blanket off the sound and adjust the high end to give it more clarity and air and I was able to obtain more instrument separation a wider sounding Sound Stage more elevated and present vocals and a tighter more Punchy low end to be honest with my kasamiku this is my favorite sounding Warehouse earbuds out there with good ANC now unfortunately I can't show you the examples I want to do to copyright but can really hear the differences with my custom EQ on songs like Daft Punk's the game of love that has a lot of air and punchiness electric mantises Rose City for the expanded Sound Stage and Silent planets pinopathicon for a more aggressive sounding electric guitar and growling bass to name a few you can gain access to my custom EQ for the xm5s along with other headphones and earbuds by becoming a channel member and hitting that join button your support helps me put together videos like this that take me over 60 hours to make a whole week full of tuning and experimentation for the EQ and the ability to purchase the equipment and products to make content like this I even have special EQ for the wavelet app for those on Android for even more fine-tuned custom EQ that I think sounds even better and it's what I'm personally using while on Android now let's hear a sample of how the custom EQ sounds it may be a bit harder to hear the difference here compared to listening with the rear earbuds in your ears but pay attention to how mellow the vocals and symbols sound on the default EQ and how the custom EQ makes it a bit clearer and more punchy this is nothing to do me I'm about to lose my mind cause when I see you I really think I need you every single summer time seasons in between now the question is which one should you buy well if you are using an iPhone it's really hard to argue with the fact that there are a lot of ecosystem benefits that come with the Apple airpods Pro 2. if you want wires charging don't get the bows as for active noise cancellation it's pretty close between these two but I would say that in my observations it seems like the xm5 is the best one if you need the longest per charge option get either of the Sony's and if you need the longest overall battery life go with the airpods pro 2. as for transparency mode I think it's a toss-up between the Bose Quite Comfort earbuds too and the airpods pro too there are slight variances that may be there because your ear shape but yeah it's not that big of a deal if you want the best microphone that removes all of your surroundings the xm5 may be an awesome but I've noticed that it puts a lot in that environment I talked to Sony about this and they believe that it was an issue with the pre-production table that they gave me and it wouldn't be a few on retail use we'll have to verify that in the later video but for now that may be a deal breaker and I do have to say that the airpods Pro 2 sound really good on a Mac as for comfort in size it's really hard to argue with the airpods Pro 2 they feel like they're hardly in your ear but I will say that the xm5s they're pretty dang comfortable they're a really good upgrade from the xm4s and quite a bit more comfortable than the Bose if you want the best sound get the xm5s with my custom EQ or the airpods pro 2. as a whole the xm5s is a huge upgrade from the xm4 so if you have an xm4 earbud and you're looking to upgrade it's totally a no-brainer if you haven't purchased one yet don't even bother with the X and forces worth the extra price because there are so many advancements here that make it quite amazing from the size the way it feels the active noise cancellation the transparency mode that's so much it's a great upgrade from the xm4s but if you're not using the iPhone the xm5s may be the best option as for pricing surprisingly the airpods Pro 2 are cheaper than the Bose and the xm5s but you can find the xm4s for a cheaper price but I would not really choose this so for any of the other options this next song has a killer base on it pay attention to that the synth and the vocal Reverb and don't forget to use the links Down Below in the description if you want to purchase any of these [Music] here forever [Music] so which one do I prefer this is kind of an interesting question to ask because it really depends on which platform I'm using at the time I tend to use two phones at the same time Android and iOS so if I'm using an iPhone it's really hard to deny that the airpods Pro 2 are just like really great because of all the ecosystem benefits that find my feature the mag safe all that is really nice but you know if I'm using an Android phone I really like the xm5s these are probably going to be my go-to especially with my custom EQ it gets it just that sound that I really prefer and the active noise cancellation is really amazing the transparency mode not exactly the best amongst all of them but I can live with it and they're quite comfortable I love the battery life on it and it still has wireless charging unlike the Bose now thanks so much to Sony for sending out the xm5s for an unbiased review that did not have any sort of review writes or copy approval and they're seeing at the same time as you now how about some outtakes in the app to get oh God oh my God where how many do I have another nice thing about having a shooter is that weird you like really dumb stuff and like nerdy stuff like this if you don't like go around thinking you're some weirdo they're like oh they're just filming a thing so you know if you want to do like socially unacceptable and weird things just have a guy film it okay up the sensors you know tape is a lot better than neat airpods that had to use meat it's got a bunch of tea you know that's the cleanup that's happening oh he's taking it away oh hopefully that's not gonna just die somewhere on the carpet airpods Pro again take two it was like metal music and I was like that's not right I'm a metal metal
1MORE Evo," - This video was sponsored by 1MORE. And they've got us checking
out their Evo earbuds today. They're available in at
least white and black. Ooh. And it looks like they have
compacted up their case quite a bit. They boast 28 hours of playback
time on a single charge, eight hours on the earbuds
themselves, the other 20 in the wireless charging case. They've got QI charging. They can also charge via USBC. They have antimicrobial ear tips, which is a pretty useful feature. I mean, I'm not usually that concerned with getting microbial
infections from my own ears but, if you were to share,
which I would never recommend, I guess that could be a concern. They offer two different
types of transparency mode, one that's just a basic transparency mode and another, that
actively looks for voices. And they've actually got multiple tiers of active noise cancellation as well. So in terms of feature richness, these are looking pretty darn complete. They boast six microphones
for rejecting ambient noise when you're on a call. And that's actually
where I'd like to start because that's a big problem that I have with my current daily
drivers, the AirPods Pros. Because of the highly subjective
nature of audio products, I should lay out, that even though this
is a sponsored video, I still can't say anything
I don't believe so. So if I were to say, these are, in spite of looking
kind of deep and bulky, extremely light and comfortable, then that would be because
that's what I actually think. And I do need to kind of, Mark, you're gonna have to try
and kinda catch me over here 'cause I need to lie down. Really for me, the main mark
of a wireless earphone's comfort, is not necessarily day to day. And these are, I mean, these are just kind of really solid there. There's no way they're
coming out of my ears, just even with the stock
tips, right out of the box, really liking that. Really lightweight. But, can I lie on them? Okay. Wow, okay. On a hard armrest, maybe a
little bit of a pressure point right here but, I looked at
these and I thought, wow, these are gonna be really uncomfortable and they are totally not. Included in the box are five
different size of ear tips. You can see them laid out here
on the table in front of me. As well as a USBC charging cable. And of course, the wireless
charging case itself. Let's get a quick size comparison in here. Apple still sets the
standard when it comes to super compact charging
cases but you can see, that one more has actually
made up a ton of ground. And when you factor in
that they've actually got greater battery capacity, then at least there's
a justification for it. Unlike how it used to be. They will fit comfortably, in what I like to call my earphone pocket. Slide in and out pretty easily. I was worried that this
textured finish might be a little bit too textured but, actually it seems not bad. You kinda get under it and there you go. And if we wanna go any further than this, we kinda need to install the app, which, conveniently, I have already done. Let's see how well their magnets
guide them into, oh, okay, that's not bad. Not a lot of fuss. That's nice. Every once in a while you'll
encounter ones where it's just like kinda finicky
to get them in place. So if I'm just, yeah, I wanna be just kinda careless,
just chuck 'em in there, yeah, not bad actually. Love how painless it
is to pair these days. Oh and they're Bluetooth 5.2, which means that they support
multi-device, pretty sic. Really? 10 millimeter dynamic driver, plus a balanced armature
driver for punchy bass and smooth mids. I don't know if I have seen
a wireless ear phone design that's hybrid, dynamic and
balanced armature drivers. Maybe I have and I just forget 'cause I'm doing this for
a long time but, okay. Put the headphone in a
comfortable position in the ear. Turn the talking mic towards the mouth and leave the earbud uncovered. Oh, so there's your main
microphone right there. And I guess this one and this one, are both for ambient sound
rejection, which makes sense. You're gonna need an
internal mic if you want to have any kind of chance of
active noise cancellation, okay. Listening modes, touch and hold
for one and a half seconds. I do wish that that auditory
feedback for changing modes, would happen once it registers. Oh, wait it does eventually. So are there three different
modes I'm cycling through? Okay, I wish it was a little faster. I wish it was one second. Okay. So let's hear transparent mode. This is full pass through. Hi, how you guys doing? - [Male] I'm doing good, yourself? - I will say, compared to the
XM5s that we just looked at, oh, sorry, the over the
ear, so, WH-1000XM5s, one more is not doing as good
a job of naturally passing through my surroundings to me. But, to their credit,
my voice in my own head, sounds way more natural. And it's far less off-putting I also don't have voice
enhancement on yet. So, can you guys hit
me with a voice again? - [Mark] Hi! - Jono, you wanna talk to me at all? - [Jono] I think you're a swell guy. - You got nothing, oh
my God, don't suck up. - [Jono] I do think you're a swell guy. - I don't detect much
difference between them but both of them are absolutely usable. It's nice to have easy
access to just no active noise cancellation, that can
help you save some battery if you just want to
passively block out noise, they are IEMs and there's
no actual, you know, air channel through them
or anything like that. So they will naturally block a
lot of the surrounding noise. And then, ANC is gonna
take that to another level. By default, they're on strong. And I can tell you that quieted down basically all of the ambient noise here, no strong pressure sensation. But, even their strong
is not the strongest I've encountered, I can
say that much already. (clapping) Now the thing about clapping, is that any ANC is gonna
have trouble with that. But you'll still be able to
take some of the edge off of it. I will say that it is
surprising how far we've come for anything other than an
Apple or a Bose product, for active noise cancellation performance. Like we are gonna need to
do a serious ANC roundup once we've got our dummy
head working and all of that. Guys, check out that LTT
video, it's coming very soon. We're gonna be benchmarking,
like, $40,000 dummy heads, for testing acoustic equipment. Sound ID. Oh, this is that personalization thing. Choose the sound you like. This is a really cool way of doing this. So it plays around with
the EQ a little bit. And then you just, A, B,
choose which one you like. And then it kind of dials
it down and dials it down. We're at the point now where
they are extremely close. Okay. Let's see what my sound signature is. Obviously that could be genre specific but they actually do a pretty good job of providing at least a handful of different genres
for you to choose from. It's now personalized. Okay. Well, what does this mean? Are you gonna show me what my like, EQ is? Oh, well, that's lame. Okay, well there's a bit of
feedback that I would provide. I'd like to see what kind
of EQ I ended up choosing. Sure. How about some Abba? (upbeat music) That is a really cool way for any idiot normy, to go through and dial in a customized EQ. Because the reality of it is, between two similarly priced headphones, a lot of the time you can make
up a lot of the difference between them, by EQing too much base out. Or by EQing down some of
the sparkle and the highs. And so by just having this
simple little set up process, that's really intuitive,
these just sound really good. How much do they cost anyway? 170 bucks. Okay, so they're priced right up there with what you would expect for a pair of feature
rich, wireless in ears. But honestly, like, I see a ton of value in that particular aspect of the software, more than just about anything else. Like they sound great because I tuned them to make sure they would sound great to me. I ended up making it all
the way through the video before remembering to do this test call to check out the mic. So, hey Jono, are you recording the call? - [Jono] Yep, I am recording. - Well, I would ask how
I sound but honestly, it's kind of irrelevant 'cause
we're gonna let the audience decide for themselves how I sound. You sound great though. - [Jono] Thank you. You sound fantastic. - Thank you. I mean, in fairness, there's
not actually a whole lot of like, ambient noise
around me right now though. Do we even really have
anything that makes a ton of noise at the moment? - [Jono] Mark kinda makes a lot of noise. - Mark, okay, that's not
the kinda noise though. It has to be like traffic
noise, like that kind of thing. Okay, here's something. I can rattle this chain. - Which way does it go? Okay, so I'm talking to you while I am raising a bay door. I don't know how much this is
making a difference or not. Okay, cool. So that's kind of what it's
supposed to sound like. And then whatever Jono
has on the other side, is what it's managing to subtract from it. No, they're not IE 600s,
which we checked out recently. Guys, you can check that video out if you're looking for
something else to watch. But they also aren't intended to be, they don't have a wire. It would also be really
nice if it spat out the EQ. And then, you know how it says, hey, you should listen to some music
and, you know, try it out, so it should spit out your EQ, then allow you to play some
music and fine tune things. So that you can find
something that works across the different genres that you like. I definitely didn't leave
enough in the highs for music like this, for example. Still tons of potential. Just like you have the
potential to subscribe. Thanks 1MORE for sponsoring this video. And thanks to you for watching. See you soon."
1MORE Evo, all right guys so today's product i'm technically not supposed to review until next week but i don't really consider my videos reviews because i consider it that i'm just telling you guys about products that i enjoy so that's what we're going to do today and we're going to talk about one more brand new evo true wireless earbuds and what these are technically is one more's attempt at going straight at the big boys when it comes to earbuds i mean they're going for sony they're going for sennheiser they're going for bowers and wilkins in fact they sent a spreadsheet that's comparing these specs from this earbud to all of those different models so we're going to talk about all of those different specs we're going to check out all the stuff that comes inside the box we're going to talk about the price and a bunch of different things and see how well it competes against a lot of those so to start with let's go ahead and talk about the price now these do come in at 169 bucks but they are offering an early bird special again these come out on may 10th and they're also throwing in a 30 qi wireless charging pad so they're taking 30 off the price so you can pick them up for 139 bucks you get a wireless charging pad with that as well and when you start to already compare price wise to the sony's which are 280 the sennheisers which are 300 and the bowers and wilkins which i don't really know but i'm gonna assume is over three hundred dollars there's already a significant gap now if you are looking at buying these they do come in two different colors i have the black version here but it's also available in white and both models are trimmed in gold so what makes this pair stand out well these are using hybrid drivers so it has a 10 millimeter dynamic driver that they are pairing up with a balanced armature driver so they're letting the dynamic driver handle all of your low end while having the balanced armature driver handle more of your mids and your treble so it's trying to keep everything separated but allowing you to get the most out of each one now as far as some of the technology these do have bluetooth 5.2 this pair is high-res audio certified because it is ldac compatible now this is something that the sony's have ldac is a higher-end bluetooth codec so if you have a device that is ldac compatible you definitely will be able to get the most out of these now this does work with one more's app and i do feel like one more app is kind of limited there's a lot of things that it doesn't let you do but one more does work with sound id which is basically a feature where it takes you through a listening test where you tell it that you prefer sound a over b or vice versa and it tries to give you an eq setting based off sounds that you like and there is a night and day difference between this sound and the sound that they have out of the box so really everybody's sound is going to be a little bit different now i do wish that the app just let you eq some things on your own but they're kind of pushing this sound id feature so i think that's kind of why they strip away some of the eq settings now also within the app you can go in and switch around some controls but there's very very limited capabilities of doing this and we'll talk about that a little bit later and you also have the ability to update your earbuds and then also turn these smart sensors on and off or change what the smart sensors do so if you want it to pause when you take it out but not resume when you put them back in you can do that or you can have it resume when you put them back in or you can just shut them off altogether so it does give you some controls and it does give you these soothing sounds if you want to use the earbuds to kind of relax or meditate or fall asleep but this is other features we've seen in other one more earbuds but the huge thing here is the ability to switch between noise cancelling on the off mode and then your transparency mode but in noise canceling you have different levels you can switch between you have an adapt mode where it'll just kind of adapt to whatever your surroundings are you have a wind noise mode so if you just want to block out some wind if you have a fan kind of blowing at you or if you're riding a bike and then it has a mild and strong and i can tell you that the strong mode gets eerily quiet i mean this is definitely where this compares to the sony and the bose that has some of the best noise canceling out there and i honestly think that the strong mode kind of even gives you that like vacuum suction type feel i mean it really does isolate you from a lot of the sounds around you now also with its active noise canceling it is using one more's quiet max technology and what this is is it's allowing the noise canceling to be used without having to overtake your audio if you're used to using noise canceling products usually when you switch the noise canceling on it starts to make your audio sound kind of bloated and although it does boost the bass just slightly on this pair for the most part there's not a huge audio difference between the noise canceling on and the noise canceling off so that is another huge plus now for you guys that do like to use more than one device at a time one more evos do have the dual device connection which basically means that you can connect to your phone while also using your tablet or your laptop uh that way you can watch a movie but if somebody calls in on your phone it's easy to just switch over and take that call without having to go into settings and shut things off and then switch things over so again this is another thing that i know a lot of you guys are interested in now as far as using this pair outdoors it does come in rated at ipx4 which means it's pretty much fine against splashes and sweat and rain and things like that but this is not one of those pairs that you can dip or drop into water now as far as what all they've included inside the box they do give you five sets of silicone ear tips and it is important that you get the right fit especially with this pair being noise cancelling and they've also included a usbc cable but a huge plus like i said earlier this pair is qi wireless charging compatible so you can just come in drop this pair on any wireless charger and it will start charging and speaking of the charging the battery life on these is not the best compared to a lot of these other ones that we mentioned earlier if you do decide to use these with the noise canceling off you can actually get about eight hours on the earbuds with around 28 hours using the case but if you do decide to use these with the noise canceling on that brings the battery life all the way down to five and a half hours on the earbuds and about 20 hours using the case now although i think that this battery life is going to be fine for most people if you compare them to the sony's i think the sony's definitely get maybe almost double what these give you so that is something you might want to keep in mind but the fast charge feature that's on this pair is very impressive if you just happen to pick your earbuds up and they are dead a 15 minute charge will give you four hours of use and again i think that is very impressive i love when earbuds give you a long battery life that you can get just by plugging your device in for about 10-15 minutes so that is definitely a huge plus for this pair now moving over to looking at the case and the earbuds themselves the case definitely has a premium feel to it i would say it almost has like a metal or aluminum type feel but it does have some good weight to it on the back you can see the usbc input for charging and then around on the front you have that single indicator light and this is what allows you just to kind of gauge how much battery life is left on the case but when you open up the lid you can see that the earbuds kind of have a glossy look right there where your touch controls are located and the frustrating thing about the touch controls on here is they only allow you to kind of switch around a couple of things you only get two different controls that you can switch between and that's the double tap and triple tap this pair does have a smart sensor so basically what i did was i let it where it will pause and play when i take the earbuds out and put them back in i change my double tap to track control and i change my triple tap to volume control that way i felt like i had control over everything but i still would have liked to have had play and paul's just on the earbuds themselves now for you guys that like to use your earbuds for phone calls one more has six microphones total there's three on each pair and these are very impressive mics i feel like no matter what environment you're in it does a really good job of focusing on your voice and blocking out a lot of your surroundings but you guys can be a judge by listening to a test here so here is the mic test using the one more evos and again this is another area that i was very impressed with i feel like it picks up my voice very clear it does have a slight digital sound but it's a lot less noticeable than it is in other earbuds so this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call and so now here's the mic test with the crowd noise being played which you can hear here and so this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call in public so now let's talk about the sound because the sound out of the box i felt like was rough i mean it sounded very dull it sounded lifeless and i've noticed that one more has basically done this with all of their earbuds that work with the sound id feature because once you go through the sound id test and it basically tries to give you an eq setting based off what it thinks you like there is a huge improvement over the sound out of the box to what it's giving you and i think that maybe again to just sell you on what sound id is doing because once i did that it basically just pushed up everything i mean this was a very boomy pair the bass had tons of impact but it also still stayed very fast which is important to me because i do listen to genres like metal the mids definitely brought the vocalist right up front so if i was listening to something chaotic i didn't feel like the vocalist just got lost with everything else and the treble definitely had a very bright sound to it now i wouldn't say that it gets harsh i would say that with some s's you can kind of get that sibling sound and to me it just gives it a really nice bright detailed sound where i still can get that very thick punchy bass so it just brings out the most in pretty much everything that you're listening to but another thing that i thought was impressive with also getting this very dynamic sound this is a very airy and spacious earbud i mean it just gives you tons of room with the noise cancelling on it does close it in quite a bit it makes you feel a lot more isolated from everything else but with the noise cancelling off you really do have this very open feel and the ability to be able to tell where instruments and sounds and all these different things are coming from this pair does a really good job with so really my overall opinion is this and again this is not a review i feel like it does lack because you can't change the eq settings yourself like you can with the sony's and some other earbuds i really wish that they just gave you all of the controls on the earbuds so you didn't have to switch things around but the fact that it does work with an app means that maybe they can fix this in an update and it also means that maybe later they can add eq options as well but as it is out of the box the app really just doesn't give you a whole lot that you can do but honestly there's not really a lot you're going to want to do i do know that you're going to want to go in and switch around the noise canceling settings because you're not going to want strong noise cancelling all the time or you may just want to block out wind or maybe you just want it to block out a little bit and i do like the fact that you can switch between these different settings if you're looking for a premium pair of noise cancelling earbuds but you don't want to pay you know 280 almost 300 dollars this is one of those pairs you might want to give a look so guys that wraps up my video on the one more evos thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay tuned for more
1MORE Evo, hey everyone today we're going to be checking out the one more Evo noise canceling earbuds they come in at 170 us 230 Australian and at this price are trying to compete with the likes of Apple Sennheiser Sony Sound core all the top noise canceling earbuds so today I'll be comparing the EVO to all those earbuds because in some ways they're really good other ways not so much so let's start with how the earbuds look it's a pretty simple look as you can see nice slick bronze Accent on the outside there glossy finish smooth matte plastic on the inside overall look it's nothing special but it gets the job done what's more important and then the looks is the fit and that's where these really do shine so as you can see in the ear canal not too bad at all it's pretty small earbud the comfort is okay it's not on the level of a pair like the one more Comfort bars or the airpods pro but I can wear these for about three hours before I get any discomfort and when it comes to how secure the fit is in my weight training session I had no issues at all with the buds falling out just a couple of readjustments were required and when like clenching my jaw through those hard sets doing some bench press making some weird training faces the buds kind of move around slightly but it's not too bad one little downside is that I couldn't find if these had an ipx rating I looked all over their website on the box I couldn't find anything so I'm assuming there is no water resistant rating if it turns out there is I'll Chuck a comment down below now let's talk about battery life the advertised amounts you're getting is five and a half hours with the earbuds 20 hours in total with noise canceling on or you're gonna get eight hours from the earbuds 28 hours in total with noise canceling off and in my test at 70 volume I haven't run the test yet I'm going to Chuck up the numbers somewhere up here to see what I got at 70 volume tested on an iPhone 10s with noise canceling on so taking all those numbers into account for the size of the case it's not too bad it could be slightly more compact compared to the airports Pro case here for reference is noticeably thinner so still overall pretty compact considering the amount of battery life you are getting you're also getting some fast charge actions so Chuck the earbuds in the case for 15 minutes you can get four hours of playback which is some of the highest that I've seen in a while and these are also compatible with your favorite wireless charger now the build quality of the case is really solid just a smooth matte finish all around you can see there's this case has been scratched up quite a bit that's because I've left it in my gym bag for about two months since I've got these maybe three months I'm not too sure so look it's gonna get scratched up but that's the point of a case I've left it in a bag with keys and a whole bunch of other earbuds so the actual build here is great and you've also got an LED indicator to let you know when you need to charge your case up now let's talk about controls sadly as usual for one more you don't get a single tap on either earbuds so this does mean you're pretty limited here's all the controls you get right out of the box but keep in mind you can customize these in the app but still with that lack of the single tap on either earbud you're pretty limited so you can add volume control if you you like but you have to sacrifice skipping tracks playing pools any detection is here so when you've got both earbuds in you take one out your music will pause and what I like seeing here say you've got noise canceling on you've got both earbuds in take one out the earbud that's still in your ear noise canceling will turn off so you don't have noise canceling on in one ear which sounds very weird in a noisy environment and of course Chuck your earbud back in to resume the music and you can also turn this on or off in the app now let's talk about connectivity you got the old high-res audio badge there which means of course you're getting your lzac codec so if you're an Android User using your high quality streaming service like apple music or tidal anything like that you're going to get about a 10 Improvement in your overall sound quality that's what I normally notice comparing ldac to either AAC or aptx but the most exciting feature here is the very rare multi-point connection so that means you can connect these earbuds to two devices at the same time and in my testing having them connected to my iPhone as well as my MacBook Pro it's very seamless it's going to pause your media on one device and play it on the next and all seamlessly switch I had no issues at all with it and it's great to see more earbuds with multi-point connection it's a rare feature nicely done one more and as you normally see with pretty much any true RC but nowadays you can leave one earbud in the case while the other is still in your ear and that works with either earbud a little issue though is that it doesn't work in mono mode so basically if you're using just one earbud you don't get your left and your right audio channels if you're using the left earbud you're only going to get the left audio channel so that's what I mean by it not working in mono mode very weird to see but most earbuds even the cheapest earbuds out there work in mono mode so don't know why it's not here but it's not here now in terms of latency there is no low latency gaming mode here but I'm just going to Chuck up my latency results in my gaming test on both IOS and Android basically if you can get around 200 milliseconds that's as low as it gets put some nice low latency if you're into Shooters and stuff like that as long as you're below 400 milliseconds or even around that it's more casual games you'll be fine but now I'll leave you with the indoor and outdoor microphone samples alright so here is a microphone test with the one more Evo and I'm just in a nice quiet room here at the moment all right so here I am in the outside world on a nice busy Motorway record my iPhone so you can hear how noisy it is out here right now and now this is what the microphone sounds like on the one little Evo so hopefully all the cars and all the noise here is getting locked up quite well all right now let's talk about the noise canceling performance as you can see you're getting an advertised 42 decibel reduction which unlimiters don't look at I just run them through my noise canceling test and how I test all my noise canceling earbuds is on my soundbar I play simulation crowd noise train noise plane noise so I can get nice high frequency and low frequency sounds and the one more Evo are coming in in that number three spot which was previously held by the Sennheiser momentum 3 so some really solid noise canceling performance nicely done one more you're also getting some customization in the app so you have a lot of different settings there with your noise canceling strength you have a wind noise reduction mode as well as an Adaptive noise canceling mode which is kind of there to adjust the noise canceling strength depending on the outside environment so this can save some battery life I was also hoping that that adaptive noise canceling would automatically turn the wind noise reduction on but sadly it doesn't now when it comes to EQ shift that's how your sound quality changes with noise canceling on compared to noise canceling off it's very minimal here the treble increases by about five percent becomes a bit harsher loses a tiny bit of detail but five percent difference is not massive at all and the bass and everything else basically stays the same now with the transparency mode it's not too bad I'm going to rate it at 7.5 out of 10 compared to a pair like the airpods pro they still have the best transparency mode a solid 10 out of 10 and the biggest difference when comparing the airpods pro to the one more Evo is when you have the airpods pro transparency mode on you don't really know it's actually on where with the one more Evo you get a bit of that static White Noise hissing sound in the background so you can kind of tell the transparency mode is on but overall 7.5 out of 10 not too bad and you also have two transparency options in the app General awareness and voice but I honestly didn't notice a huge difference between the two now let's talk about what's obviously most important sound quality and overall I'm a little disappointed with the sound here one more is definitely known for their more natural tuning and one more Advertiser sound with Crystal Clear highs accurate mids and warm bass and that's kind of what you get getting but doesn't really work at least for my ears so the high end here definitely has some nice Sparkle it's a sparkly treble response which is well separated from the other frequencies it sounds really nice but at the cost of getting harsh quite often even when you're not venturing at too high of a volume even around 60 some songs can get a little bit over the top with the treble now the biggest disappointment here for me is the base they've advertised it as balanced and it kind of is but it still sounds pretty flat to my liking I find this kind of bass response only really works with instrumentation and that kind of stuff if you're into hip-hop EDM hard dance music even if you EQ these in the app you can't really push out enough bass and even with genres like SCI trans I noticed the bass got a little bit wonky at times with certain songs but I am a bit of a bass head and I will compare this to other buds in a sec but if you just want to listen to instrumentation this is going to be good for you still now even with this lackluster base the mid-range is really nothing special I was expecting a little more Clarity and detail with the mids they are accurate I guess a little bit recessed so it's kind of a more a more smooth mid-range so overall the sound here it's the treble is kind of the star of the show it is nice trouble but that's about it couple Pros though is the Sound Stage and instrument separation is very solid which is kind of expected with this kind of tuning now luckily there is some EQ customization and this is what I use to kind of boost the mids and bring the trouble down ever so slightly and I find this makes them sound a little bit better if you wanted to make these a more bass heavy sounding earbud you can pump that bass all the way up it's just not going to sound that good so I found not really bothering by increasing the bass it just gets a little bit over the top and I'd say the most lacking part is with sub bass you don't really get too deep of a bash response so basically I'd rate it like it's 5 out of 10 on my sub scale which is probably the lowest I've ever rated now I will pop up my generating checklist so you can see all the different genre ratings there kind of as I explain the sound you're getting higher scores with more instrument focused music uh anything EDM it's again not terrible I'm being a bit hard here but like I said I feel like I'm being a bit harsh but that's kind of because I obviously compared these to a lot of earbuds that have a similar kind of balanced more natural tuning airpods Pro definitely known for their balanced natural tuning which a lot of people like very mid focused I have to say that airpods Pro easily sound better than the one more Evo here you're also getting slightly more of that deep sub bass on the airpods pro these aren't a bud that are known for a heavy bash response but it's got a better experience with more genres on the airpods pro and the treble also doesn't get harsh ever very nice travel on the airpods pro another earbud with a balanced training the Galaxy buds Pro quite a mid Focus tuning but again just comparing the sound here you've got a fuller bass response on the buds Pro a more forward mid-range treble also an issue here slightly harsh at higher volumes in some songs but overall better listening experience on the buds Pro now compared to a cheaper pair the edifier Neo buds Pro slightly cheaper than the one more Evo here when it comes to Pure Clarity and detail instrument separation all that good stuff the one more Evo do get the win but the Neo buds come very close and they are pushing out a lot more bass more bass compared to the airpods pro and the buds Pro so if you do like a bit of extra bass and don't mind losing a bit of detail the price these are up these are going to be the better option now compared to the sound core Liberty 3 Pro think of these like the Neo buds a bass heavy tuning but a little bit of extra detail in the instrument separation and Clarity department so kind of a better sounding Neo buds Pro so that kind of explains that now we're kind of going into more expensive earbuds but the Sony WF xm4s these can just EQ a lot better than the one more Evo so you can actually get the Sony's sounding very close to that natural kind of tuning the one more Evo have then you have more flexibility to make these quite a bass heavy tuning overall just sound better and that's also going to be a similar situation with the Sennheiser momentum 3. quite a bass heavy tuning out of the box when it comes to the Natural tuning and instrument separation the one more Evo do get the win but again just to Fuller sound you get more customization on the EQ with the sunnis and these are still one of my favorite buds with a bass heavy tuning retaining as much clarity as possible so to wrap it up here the only two major issues at least for me is the sound and the lackluster touch control customization apart from that noise cancel performance is great fit is great everything else is spot on I just wish the tuning was a little bit better but again you might like it but I'm being honest here I don't really like it but I'm not going to forget the lzac support as well as multi-point connection so overall solid stuff as long as you like your natural tuning but if you're like me you like a bit more of a fuller sound I will leave my Sennheiser momentum 3 review up here so check that out in the meantime stay picky I'll see you in the next video bye now

i said you do not have to spend over 200 bucks for high-res audio in 2022. i just always get my juices flowing let's go i've searched they didn't pay for for a love that i thought i couldn't find i and they out for a love that's mine oh mine i absolutely found that phone [Music] and he knows that i'm playing the fool let's go the ginger came into my life and you changed that now i know what i wanna where is that um i hope this is my part right here since i found you [Music] let's go let me calm down let me calm down all right let's try the uh smart playing balls all right okay whoo bro again and i was kind of hyped right there these are the truth this is another one of these earbuds that i would easily easily state my youtube reputation and tell you that if you buy these you are not going to be disappointed okay the sound quality on these earbuds are ridiculous now i'm going to put them back in real quick because there's one thing that i want to test all right i got the music started playing by itself we got to take it over to nipsy hustle blue laces 2. okay here we go oh baby i'm trying to hold it in now i'm holding my excitement okay let's go [Laughter] this song does it whoa bro bro monkey let me know that all right i take these out again now look i'm gonna be honest with y'all when i test earbuds i know i tend to get hyped because i love music this is one of my passions in life is music and when i hear music that's played the right way when the quality of the music it tends to touch my soul i am not exaggerating what i'm telling y'all right now these earbuds are the truth now when i originally seen the price i had 169 bucks when you think when you think about one more you tend to think of budget earbuds someone's like i don't know can they really compete with the other big boy brands at that price range these deliver okay again i would state my youtube reputation on this if you buy these earbuds you're going to love the sound quality on these these are one more best earbuds to date easily all right let's keep it moving and do a little bit more testing all right so let's do the reconnection test how long did it take to reconnect to your phone after you take them out and put them in the charging case let's get them pop these out okay we'll drop them in the case wait for them to fully disconnect okay here we go take them out one mississippi wow before i was about to say two mississippi it already connected instant connection all right so now let's try the dual device connection feature now i turned off smart playback so you can hear it for yourself i'm gonna hit play in the music okay this is from the android phone let's hit pause now play music from the iphone and there it is all right so you can rock two devices at the same time now let's do the one earbud test can you play music from one earbud while the other one is charging up in the case let's hit play in the music okay now i'm gonna take out the left earbud let's drop it in the case close it up let's hit play on the music okay the music is playing out of the right side let's put the left side back in okay reconnect it instantly take the right side out drop it in the case let's see playing the music okay the music is playing so this is pretty dope you can play music from either earbud while the other one is charging up in the case basically doubling the battery life alright so now let's check the touch controls and on the side note these are fully customizable but here's how i got my setup so triple tap on the right earbud for playing pause okay the music is playing double tap on the right earbud to skip to the next song and double tap on the left ear bud to go to the previous track just like that now again if you want to customize it go to the app and go into settings and you can switch these up all right so now let's check the call quality i'm gonna call amaya up one more evo dual devices connected at the same time let's get max volume hi girlie what's up why you whispering what you doing over there okay okay okay all right what's up um you trying to work all right good you're good check this out all right i got some new earbuds i need you to tell me how i sound sound good which one do you think sound better these are the last ones i tested i don't know if you remember okay that was a dumb question right all right check this out let me let

some okay cool and what time you get in on friday man you sure you can't make it i know i'm too hype all right so i just gotta wait till saturday i know i i know i'm saying i'm not hyped for the food i'm hyped to see you i don't really care about the food okay i do care about the food but i'm happy to see you too though come on bro by waiting all summer for this all right so go back to sleep all right me and you got the same sleep schedule man this is i'm supposed to be sleeping right now too i know i know you know gotta make the donuts here all right i'll talk to you a little bit bye okay core quality on these now this is actually my second phone call that i made on these earlier i ordered some food fat fatness alert these sound excellent okay no issues with the call quality i heard a font she heard me fine i would rank these as a1 all right so now let's check for latency and what i mean by that is when you're watching a video is there any delay from the person's lips to what you hear okay now i got netflix skewed up i was watching a little war of the worlds no lip sync delay at all so this will be perfect for watching your videos all right so now let's talk about transparency mode and active noise cancellation now as far as transparency mode no issues at all i got it turned on right now i can hear my voice crystal clear i can hear my snaps i can hear my nails on the table and i can't white shoes sounded like a v12 now as far as active noise cancellation this is one of the features that blew me away about these earbuds the amc on these is top tier now y'all know i got three tiers trash tear okay chair and top tier these are without a doubt top tier active noise cancelling earbuds now earlier i had them on upstairs i was doing a little bit of work i was watching the court case on tv at the same time and as i was playing with these i had on amc it sounded like my tv was completely off i could hear no sound from the tv at all then i turned on transparency mode got back to the case a little bit turned on anc drowned everything out walked around the corner to the store i was singing mad loud trust me when i tell you the anc on these is top tier okay so let's kind of wrap this up overall on a scale of 1-10 i'm giving the one more evo buds a major major major go and for 169 bucks as bob barker would say the price is right for high-res audio again in 2022 you do not have to spend over 200 bucks to get this kind of get this uh amazing sound quality trust me again i would state my youtube reputation on these you're gonna love these okay these are worth every penny i don't know what the early bird discount is maybe 30 bucks off whatever it is if you like these i would advise you to jump on these immediately because the price is going to go up okay yesterday's price is not today's price anyway one more evo buds packed with features top tier amc the sound quality is going to blow you away extra bass extra highs extra mids extra everything okay i

1MORE Evo, all right so the time is officially here uh we are checking out the one more evo true wireless earbuds and these are the latest flagship earbuds from one more and they're bringing a ton of value for the price uh they're coming in at 169 bucks but from now until june 8th you can actually take advantage of their early bird pricing which is going to save you an additional 30 dollars so you can pick these up for only 140 which is an excellent price if you ask me so after you watch this video make sure you check out the link down in the description so that you can take advantage of that deal so we're going to get into the video but let me just tell you this right off the bat these are competing uh with pretty much anything out there the bose the sony uh probably the sennheisers even though i don't have those yet i'm supposed to be getting those in a few days so i'll make sure to do some comparisons but i'm gonna go out on a limb and say that they're competing with those as well so enough of that let's just go ahead and jump right into it starting off with the case so one thing i love about the case is the finish and just the feel of it i mean almost has like a brushed metal type of feel i'm not sure if it is or not it might just be plastic but um it definitely feels premium in the hands obviously you have your one more branding on the top you also have a single led indicator in the middle on the back is where you have your type c charging port and the case does support wireless charging which is always nice to have on the inside you do have a pairing button there in the middle and overall the build quality of the case is definitely solid moving over to the earbuds you do have black as well as white as color options obviously we have the black version here so you have the one more branding there in the center on the touch surface and then it's surrounded by kind of a rose gold accent which definitely gives it a premium look in my opinion as far as the touch controls uh typical one more fashion you have a double tap a triple tap as well as a long press the long press is dedicated to control the active noise cancellation as well as the transparency mode and then the double tap and triple tap can be customized within the one more app and then you also do have in-ear detection with these so these are running bluetooth 5.2 as far as audio codecs you have sbc aac as well as ldac so if you have a compatible device you can tap into that high resolution codec these also support independent use so you can use either the left or the right earbud while the other remains inside of the case as far as battery life with active noise cancellation turned off you're looking at roughly eight hours on a single charge with a total of 28 hours including the case with active noise cancellation turned on you're looking closer to five and a half hours on a single charge with a total of 20 hours including the case and then these also have an ipx4 water resistant rating so they're safe for sweat and light splashes of water but definitely not a pair that you want to completely submerge so when it comes to the fit these actually surprise me because usually when it comes to flagship earbuds they're very large because they're trying to pack a lot of technology in there but these are actually pretty reasonable in terms of size so i'm able to get a pretty decent fit uh so for me casual use is perfectly fine uh if you have medium to larger size ears i definitely think you can get away with using these for more intense movements like hitting the gym as far as comfort these are also very comfortable if you didn't notice these are using those oval shaped ear tips which helps tremendously in terms of the comfort so wearing these for extended periods of time should be no problem so before we jump into the sound quality let's talk a little bit about the active noise cancellation as well as the transparency mode so when it comes to noise cancellation you do have a few different modes um so you have strong you have mild uh you have wind noise reduction and you have adaptive so strong and mild those are pretty self-explanatory the wind noise reduction that's going to be helpful for the times that you're outdoors and it's very windy and you get that annoying sound of the wind blowing past the microphones of the earbuds you can activate that setting and it's almost going to eliminate that sound completely so it's definitely helpful and then as far as the adaptive uh that's basically where the earbuds will detect how much noise is taking place around you and then adjust the active noise cancellation accordingly so overall the active noise cancellation is definitely giving you some flagship performance now the question that everybody wants to know is it enough to dethrone bose or sony and i would say not quite but don't get me wrong we're talking like one one a type performance so it's extremely close to the bose and the sony which is saying quite a bit so if you were to purchase these and test out the active noise cancellation there's not enough difference there that you would regret purchasing these compared to something like the bose or the sony and then once you factor in the price difference you're definitely going to be satisfied with your purchase and it's pretty much the exact same thing with the ambient mode flagship level performance you do have two different modes for that as well so you have the pass-through mode as well as the voice enhancement mode and comparing these again to like the bose and the sony there's not really much difference there that you can really detect so now let's go ahead and talk about the sound quality which is where things start to get interesting so make sure you stay tuned for my full-on comparison videos because i will go a little bit deeper as far as how these stack up against the competition but i will say that the dual driver setup sounds incredible um you're getting some very nice separation between the bass and the treble you're getting a very powerful sound and overall some very good extension and just overall range they also take the eq adjustments very well so within the one more app you do have access to the sound id feature which is basically like a hearing test that you can go through and based on that the app will come up with a custom eq profile just for you so i definitely recommend going through the steps for that because it does improve the sound tremendously but if you want a little hack for these earbuds what i did is through on some eq on top of the sound id so depending on what music streaming service you use if you have access to a third-party equalizer if you do some adjustments within that eq it makes it sound even better and these can definitely handle it like i said the overall extension and just dynamic range that they're capable of is super impressive so overall the sound quality on these is absolutely amazing so when it comes to phone calls these are using a total of six microphones so let's go ahead and do a microphone test to give you guys an idea of the call quality alright so this is a microphone test of the one more evo true wireless earbuds right now we have quiet conditions testing testing one two three testing testing one two three now let's see how they sound once we add some background noise all right so now we got some crowd noise being played on a speaker so this should give you a rough idea as to how you would sound if you take cards in a noisy environment testing testing one two three testing testing one two three so overall if you're looking for a pair of earbuds to give you flagship level performance here in 2022 these should definitely be on your list of consideration the one more evo true wireless earbuds so again i will put that link down in the description and don't forget about that 30 off early bird special up until june 8th uh definitely make sure you take advantage of that if you're interested so that's gonna be it for this video do me a favor if you found it to be helpful go ahead and give it a thumbs up as well as subscribe to the channel you can also follow me on social media at ceo in the making to stay up to date on all my latest content and aside from that as always i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] you
1MORE Evo," - [Host] The 1More Evo have arrived and I'm here to answer all
your questions about them. We have a lot to talk about, so let's not waste any time. So first up, let's start with
that Bluetooth connection. So the 1More Evo are
featuring Bluetooth 5.2 with SBC, AAC, and LDAC
as their connection codex. This makes them perfectly compatible with both your iOS and Android devices. But in order to use high res LDAC, you do have to be on an Android device. Now, when it comes to Bluetooth range, it can vary between 21
feet or 6.4 meters on LDAC to about 34 feet or 10.3
meters when using AAC. Now, obviously this is always gonna vary depending on how many walls
or obstructions you put in between the earbuds and the
device they're connected to. Now, in addition to this, the 1More Evo also
features single usage mode, and that's where you can use
each earbud independently while the other one is
charging in its case. However, it does pause
when you make that switch. All you have to do is push
play and it'll continue, but unfortunately it's
just not as seamless as some other earbuds on the market. In addition to that,
you also lose access to both active noise cancellation
and transparency mode when in single usage mode. Now I know that won't apply to everyone, but for those that it does
apply to, keep that in mind. Now that's gonna bring us over to one of my favorite
features of the 1More Evo, and that is their multipoint connectivity for up to two devices. So for testing, I actually
had these paired up with both my iPhone 12 Pro
and my Xiaomi 11 Light and it was a perfect connection. This is gonna be super
handy for people that wanna use the 1More Evo with their
cell phone and their laptop, maybe for business or work
or anything of that nature. Now, unfortunately I did find a quirk with the multipoint when it
comes to the sound ID EQ, but more on that when I
get into the sound quality later on in this video. Now, when it comes to lag or latency, there is minimal latency
to be experienced with the 1More Evo when watching videos on YouTube, Hulu, Netflix,
or anything of that nature, especially when you're using
them with the AAC or SBC codex. Now, this will become more noticeable when you switch over to LDAC. So I would just reserve
using LDAC for when you're listening to music and
you really want to enjoy it. Now, when it comes to mobile gaming, the 1More Evo is good for casual games like asphalt 9, 1945, or
something like Boom Beach. However, I would not
recommend the 1More Evo for competitive mobile
games like Call of Duty since there is no low
latency or gaming mode, and that latency is noticeable. So that's gonna bring us
over to the next section, and that's the battery life. So, 1More was claiming
five and a half hours with noise cancellation turned on or eight hours with noise
cancellation turned off with an additional two to
four charges in the case. Now this was done using the
AAC codec and 50% volume. And this is what we call
a best case scenario. I do things a bit differently
in my own testing, and I use both AAC and LDAC as well as raising the volume to 75%. I feel like that's a bit more
realistic to the way that regular people are gonna
be using these earbuds. Now, in my own actual testing, there is a lot of measurements here, so I'm gonna go ahead and
put them up on the screen. Feel free to pause and
check them out for yourself. As you can see here, using both LDAC and ANC at the same time is truly the worst case scenario and significantly hurts that battery life. That said, the numbers are
just about what I expected based on my experience with
other true wireless earbuds with these features. Now, when it comes to recharging
the earbuds themselves, the 1More Evo do feature
a fast charging mode where you can drop the
earbuds back into their case for 15 minutes and this will give you an additional four hours
worth of playback time. And then charging of the case
itself comes via USB type C, and they do feature wireless
charging here as well. Now the case itself is small and compact with a cool metal feel in the hands. It's very similar to
the charging case from 1More's previous flagship earbuds, except for being a bit more compact now. Now, the case is similar size to both the Sony XM-4 and
Technics AZ-60 case. Yet the 1More feels more premium due to the Sony and Technics
using a more plastic build, where the 1Mores have
that metal feel to them. But enough about the case, let's get into the earbuds themselves. So this brings us to one of
the more important questions and that's the comfort. The 1More Evo feature a compact
and highly ergonomic design. The shape is very similar to 1More's own color buds line of earbuds, which were some of the
most comfortable ones that I've personally ever worn. I haven't experienced any pain or fatigue while wearing these for
long listening sessions. The included ear tips are a step up from what we normally see with most
true wireless in the market. And they work well enough,
but if you want to improve seal and comfort and grip on top of that, I strongly recommend you grab a set of these Spin Fit CP-1025s. I'll leave a link for them
in the description below. If you're interested in that,
they fit the stems perfectly and still allow the charge
case to fully close. Now, speaking of grip,
with the right size tips, the 1More Evo offers solid
grip for most activities, and they can be used
for workouts or sports because they do carry an IPX 4 rating. Even so, I would still refrain from fully submerging these underwater, so no swimming or showering
or anything of that nature. Seeing as how the 1More Evo
are so small and comfortable, naturally, people might want to know if these are good for sleep. In fact, they are actually really good for both back and side sleepers, but the touch controls are sensitive, so if you're one of those people who sleep with their hands under
their face like this, you might accidentally
trigger the long press command if you're not careful. Another question that pops
up from time to time is how do these earbuds
handle body-borne noises like footsteps, heartbeat, or breathing? The 1More Evo do a decent
job in normal mode, but if you activate
the noise cancellation, it actually reduces those
body-borne noises even further. It's actually kind of
spooky good if you ask me. Now, 1More has done an
excellent job with this, but more on the ANC a
bit later in this video. And that's gonna bring us over to the aforementioned touch controls. The 1More Evo are featuring
responsive touch controls. You get access to a double tap, a triple tap, and a long press. Sadly, there is no single
tap with the 1More Evo. These commands are somewhat customizable in the 1More music app. I say somewhat customizable because only the double tap and
triple tap can be changed, and the settings are
both left and right sides at the same time, there is no individual
adjustment based on each side. And there's also no way to
deactivate the touch controls if that's so desired. Thankfully, all these issues
could possibly be addressed by 1More if they wish, but only time will tell if
they will respond to that. But that brings me to a question here. What do you think? Should 1More give customers more control over the touch commands? Whether yes or no, let me know
down in the comment section. Most likely they're gonna
be reading your answers, so feel free to sound off. Now that's gonna bring us
over to the 1More music app. This app is available for
both iOS and Android devices. When you open it up, it's gonna
show you the battery life of both the earbuds and the case. Below this, you're gonna
get your listening modes for active noise cancellation
and transparency modes, and you do get four different active noise cancellation modes, and two different transparency
modes with this app. Below this, you also
get the smart playback, which is basically your
ear detection settings. There is a little bit of
wiggle room with those settings if you want to mess with them. Below this, you have your custom setting, which is the touch controls, where you can make those adjustments that I had mentioned before. Below that you have your
sound ID hearing test for a personalized EQ. Below that you also have your
over the air firmware updates, if there's any available. Below this, you have your quick guide. Lastly, you also have your soothing sounds for sleep and relaxation. Now a quick word of warning here, you do have to be using both earbuds in order to use this app properly. Trying to use EQ, the
controls, or listening modes is blocked while using
them in single usage mode. Kind of dumb if you ask me, but that's just the way they roll. So now let's move over to some of the actual
performance of the 1More Evo. Let's start with the
active noise cancellation. 1More was claiming a
minus 42 decibel reduction in their strong setting, and it gives you some
strong ANC performance, let me tell you. There are also four different levels here that you can choose from. You have strong, you have mild, you have WNR, which is
wind noise reduction, and you have an adaptive mode. This 42 decibel claim, it's legit. ANC performance is excellent, and can be top tier when combined
with memory foam eartips. I tested them against both
of my top ANC earbuds, the Sony WF-1000 XM-4 and the
Bose quiet comfort earbuds. The 1More Evo are just a
hair below both of them for ANC strength, when used
with memory foam eartips. If you're interested in trying out a set of the memory foam eartips, I'll leave a link to
those down below as well. With silicone tips, you do lose some of that passive isolation
that you get with the foam, and it makes the 1More
Evo noise cancellation fall more in line with other
ANC earbuds under 200 bucks. Now, moving over to the mild setting, I didn't notice a big difference here between mild and strong, but the difference is there. Less pressure feeling, if anything. Next to this, you have the WNR, which stands for wind noise reduction. It works well outdoors when I'm on walks, but I just wish it was a
setting that could be used with transparency instead of
active noise cancellation. And that way it could block out wind while I'm maintaining my
situational awareness. I think that would be dope. And then last but not
least, the adaptive mode, and this is the best of the
bunch in my personal opinion since it automatically adjusts itself based on ambient noise levels. The changes are noticeable
between mild and strong and it works surprisingly well, and it actually responds pretty quickly. Once again, 1More is here proving that they really do know what they're doing when it comes to active
noise cancellation. But as I said throughout this section, if you wanna get the most out of the ANC for the 1More Evo, you gotta try some of
those memory foam eartips. Now let's move over to
the transparency mode. The 1More Evo transparency
mode works well enough, and there are two modes. You get a full pass through and
you get a voice enhancement. The full mode, it's not up to par with like your Apple AirPods
Pro or even the 1Plus buds, which are highly impressive when it comes to a transparency mode. The voice enhancement, it does indeed give added
energy to human voices, but it's not a night and day difference. I would've loved to see a volume slider for the transparency mode, so I could adjust the strength
to suit my current situation. Now, this is something
that could be addressed via firmware update if
1More wants to do so, but overall, the transparency mode leaves a little bit to be desired here. Now that's gonna bring us
over to the sound volume. So in my measurements, the 1More Evo measured
113.7 decibels peak volume. So for me, listening comes
in around 60 to 80% at max. There's more than enough headroom here. If you have any quiet dialogue in a movie or maybe an audio book, it's totally gonna have you covered, even for some of those people who might be a little harder hearing, or
maybe just a volume junkie, there's gonna be plenty
of volume for you here. So now let's move over
to the sound quality. Let's get into the meat and potatoes here. The 1More Evo features a
hybrid dual driver setup to bring you the best sound
experience that they offer. Combining that with the sound ID feature that creates a personalized
EQ for your ears, and you have a powerful,
powerful listening experience. But let me break it down. So first let's start with that bass. Here we have some top tier bass response. There's deep sub bass rumble that you can feel as much as you can hear. The 1More Evo bring that thump without it getting muddy either. It hits quick and only
rumbles when needed. The test track that I used for bass was ""I'm Throwed"" by Paul Wall
featuring Germaine Dupree. Shout out to all my H-town peeps. This track is a certified banger that belongs on any basshead's playlist. Shout out to the basshead crew. Pause this video, add this
song to your playlist, then come back and finish this video, because the comparison
section is coming soon. Now let's move over to the mid-range, and the mids have a natural
warmth that feels alive. The live instruments have
impressive depth here that I was really surprised by. Vocals sound lively and clear, but definitely shine
more with male vocals. You also get a medium to wide sound stage with live recordings. It's actually quite impressive. The test track that I used here was ""Soulsville"" by Isaac Hayes. Wait for two minute and 13 seconds, when the vocals kind of
drop back, the sax pops in only to open back up to
Isaac's smooth vocal. This is that old school
soul that I grew up with and love with all my heart. So please give it a listen, do it as a favor to your boy El Jefe. Now that's gonna bring
us over to the treble. The 1More Evo have some
bright treble here. It's crisp and clean, and it has a surprising
airiness in the sound. There's some pretty good
detail here as well, not to mention some excellent imaging here and instrument separation. Obviously the sound
quality here in the treble. It's gonna depend on
your own personalized EQ, but mine seems to push the treble forward, which could be too strong for those who happen to be treble sensitive. So that's something you
want to keep in mind. But overall, I'm very
happy with the treble. The test track that I used here was ""The Chain"" by Fleetwood Mac. There's no timestamp here. Just sit back, relax, and
listen to the subtleties in the instrumentation
on this well-known track. Now let's talk about the EQ. The 1More Evo rely on the
sonar work sound ID system to create a personalized
EQ based on a hearing test, which is similar to what Soundcore Nora
and 1Plus are offering. I actually remember testing this, an early version of this at
CES 2020 back in the day, and it's improved greatly since then. I ran the sound ID test multiple times with each of the test songs
that are included in the app and I got dramatically different results. Some of them were hilariously bad and some of them were much, much better. The best one for me personally was when I used the test song
that goes, ""I am here,"" and it says it's by Lily
Wire and Debbie Lee Star. The last one in the list. This one gave me the controlled bass and rich vocal clarity that I was after. Lastly, earlier in this video I mentioned a quirk with the EQ when
I was using the 1More Evo with two devices in multipoint mode. You have to be sure to
run the sound ID test using the same test song
on all of your devices, and that's gonna ensure a similar EQ when you move from one phone to another. Otherwise you're gonna have
a bunch of different sound coming from different devices, which for me was personally annoying. So now, if I have to give one more any constructive criticism
on the 1More Evo, first up, it's gonna be the lack of a low latency gaming mode. It would've been awesome to see that here with these earbuds, but sadly it seems to
have been overlooked. Secondly, the lack of single tap and also being able to toggle all of the touch controls on and off, and the lack of the ability to do independent controls on either side. That's something that I wish
that they would address. If you give us just a bit
more control over our control so we can really personalize
into our own personal taste. That would be a huge win for
their whole customer base. Thirdly, the lack of being
able to use your sound ID, the custom controls, or
listening modes in the app while in single usage mode. That just seems like an oversight somehow, like maybe somebody didn't realize that that is what was happening, but if we could unlock
that in single usage mode, it would be super helpful. I'm hoping that these
issues are something that 1More can address via firmware update. I don't know, I don't know
the technicalities behind it, but it would be dope to
see 1More really step up and improve a product that's
already very, very good. Now, let me answer a quick question that came up in the
community tab of my channel, and somebody was asking
me if the 1More Evo are better than the OG 1More TWS ANC, which were their original flagship. And my answer to that
is abso-fricking-lutely, the smaller size, improved sound quality, better ANC, better transparency mode, better call quality, improvements
in the battery and volume. I mean, it's an easy win. Not to mention the multipoint as well. So yeah, definitely an
easy, easy win here. Secondly, are the 1More Evo worth buying despite their flaws? And the answer to that once again is yes, I highly recommend them, but at the end of the day, the 1More Evo have to
fit your specific needs. There are so many options available on the market at this price point that there's bound to be an option that can truly suit your needs, whether it be the 1More
Evo or something else. Now, let's move over to the comparison portion of this review, and for this comparison, we're gonna be putting
the 1More Evo up against the Soundcore Liberty 3
Pro, the Technics AZ-60, the Edifier Neobuds Pro,
and the Sony WF-1000 XM-4. I have full reviews on each of the earbuds in this comparison, and I'll leave links to all of
them in the video description if you're interested. So now let's start the rankings. First, the active noise cancellation. In first place, we've got Sony. In second place, we've got 1More. In third place, we've got Technics. Fourth place, we've got Soundcore. And in fifth place, we've got Edifier. This is where 1More really came through. The active noise cancellation
strength is seriously good and can easily compete at flagship level. While still beaten by the
likes of Sony and Bose, they still hold their own at a substantially lower price point. Now, let's do the
transparency mode ranking. In first place, we've got Sony. In second place, we've got Edifier. In third place, we've got 1More. Fourth place, we've got Soundcore. And in fifth place, we've got Technics. Sony easily has the most natural
sounding transparency mode out of this bunch. 1More isn't bad here. Just middle of the pack
performance at best. So now, let's move over
to the volume ranking. In first place, we've got
Edifier with 114.9 DB. Second place, we got 1More with 113.7 DB. Third place, we got Soundcore with 111 DB. Fourth place, we got
Technics with 109.3 DB. And in fifth place, we
got Sony with 104 DB. Now, please allow me to clarify something for my longtime viewers. Some of these numbers have
changed from previous videos and that's for a good reason. I'm using a newer, more accurate rig to measure the volume of these earbuds, and I'll be retesting many
earbuds over the next few weeks to make sure all my records are updated. I just wanted to keep you all in the loop. So now, let's move on to sound quality. So for sound quality, in first place, we've got
the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro. In second place, the 1More Evo. Third place, we got the Techniques AZ-6. Fourth place, we got
the Edifier Neobuds Pro. And fifth place, we've
got the Sony WF-1000 XM-4. So Soundcore still takes the
win here for sound quality, while 1More can definitely compete. They lack the versatility
that Soundcore provides with their multiple presets,
their hearer ID setting, and their graphic equalizer. Now you combine that with the additional bass and treble
extension of the Soundcores, and the winner is clear. But let's not cast doubt on the prowess of the
1More Evo sound quality. They are truly excellent,
but a win is a win. I know I only included a few
earbuds in this comparison. If you're curious how the
1More Evo stack up against a set of earbuds that I did
not mention in this video, please feel free to ask me down in the comment section below, and I will be answering your questions. Now that's gonna bring us over
to the microphone samples. I'm gonna test all of them
back to back, and this way you can hear which one is
gonna work best for you. All right, so here we
have the microphone test for the 1More Evo. Testing, testing 1, 2, 3. Obviously I'm indoors
in a semi-quiet room. Testing, testing 1, 2, 3. All right, so here we have

down in the comment section. Now, 1More was kind enough to send these earbuds over for this review. There was no monetary
compensation involved, and 1More was not
afforded any copy approval or early access to this video
prior to it being published. And I'm telling you this
because I believe in honesty and transparency with you as the viewer. As always, please be sure
to watch multiple reviews before making that
final purchase decision. Now, if you're interested

Jefe, and I'm out this bitch."
1MORE Evo, [Music] hey guys today we're going to look at the one more evo these are noise cancelling earbuds that are high-res certified meaning that just like the sony wf000xm4 it supports high-res streaming over ldac codec and their large 10 millimeter drivers are able to reproduce double the frequency range of regular earbuds but do they actually sound as good if not better than the mark force despite the mark force having smaller drivers and a bigger price well it's not that simple but we're gonna listen to some sample recordings look at some charts so that you can have a clearer picture about which one you should go for there's lots to cover in this video so i've split this video into chapters so if you want to you can simply navigate to the parts you're interested in now in terms of fit and comfort these aren't tight enough for intensive workouts would have been tighter with foam tips like the sony's but for everyday usage these are pretty stable they've got up to 5.5 hours of battery in the earbuds in up to 20 hours with its case which also supports wireless charging it does have multi-point pairing being able to connect up to two devices at the same time now some other earbuds do have that too but what makes the evos so different is that you can still stream in high resolution mode from both devices provided that they both support ldac the sonys don't have multi-point pairing at all period so if you're a power user these are a better alternative the evos also have app support the app feels fully decked this is where you do the noise cancelling presets activate multi-point and it's got sound quality settings that do a fantastic job of tweaking the audio whether it's with 12 different presets a very responsive graphic eq and something called sound id which really is a shortcut to getting the buzz to sound great by taking this listening quiz i've recorded the difference between how the evos sound like with its default tuning and after sound id this is a binaural recording so i recommend putting on some earbuds that way you'll get to hear all the details in the recording have a listen [Music] [Music] i cannot say what's wrong all right it's not hard to fool me [Music] what i don't like about the app is how sluggish it feels it takes a while for each action to register and how limited it is when it comes to customizing the touch controls because you can only customize the double tap and triple tap gestures in terms of sound quality after comparing these earbuds side by side with both on flat eq streaming over ldac the only differences i could pick up easily is that the evos are brighter in the mids and a bit crisper in the highs while the xm4s sound heavier and more laid back in the mid-range this means the vocals on the xm4 have more body but you're gonna get more sizzle from the evils especially with female vocalists also a bit more airiness in the sound stage [Music] who's looking back at me i don't know what happened guess we weren't meant to be i know we had problems i thought we could fix we got tired there's nothing left to do but to say goodbye and try to move on i'll get over you only wish that i knew how to go on [Music] when it's not like i'm gonna [Music] in terms of base extension impact clean track separation i have to say that these perform about as well so it really is all about whether you prefer a bit more sizzle a bit more sibilance even or if you want thicker heavier vocals that sound more authoritative otherwise you can always tweak their sound quality through their respective apps to suit your tastes by the way if you're wondering which of these is louder they've got about the same volume level right now we're going to compare their call quality and i'm going to do this under both quiet and extreme conditions using some really loud cafe style background noise and some wind noise coming from this fan over here i am now making the phone call in a quiet place using the one more evo background noise [Music] call in a noisy place using one more evo i am now making a phone call in a quiet place using the sony wf thousand wf-20xm4 background noise i'm not making a phone call in a noisy place using the sony wf-14 i think the evo's mic pickup is better in quiet conditions my voice sounded sharper cleaner and in noisy conditions it did better at cancelling background noise than the sony's now we're gonna see how the evo's active noise cancelling compares against the sony's with the very same background noise as before [Music] in terms of noise cancelling they seem to be quite comparable at cancelling the lower frequencies that's the rumble of a subway train the droning of a plane's engine but the sonys are gonna do a much better job at muffling the mid range which is the range where human voices are the most prominent so background chatter in a cafe are gonna be blocked better by the sonys not surprised they do have foam tips after all which are more effective at muffling that kind of noise but the one more evils are quite effective at cancelling background harming and droning in general just like the sony's in terms of transparency there is no doubt that the sony's sound a lot cleaner and more transparent because when i'm using these in transparent mode i was having a little trouble hearing people's voices when i'm speaking to them it seems like the evos weren't amplifying that frequency range as well as the xm4 aside from that if it's just about being more aware of your surroundings you won't have any trouble with the evils they do have very decent pass through to conclude based on what i'm saying compared to the evils the sony's biggest advantage is being more polished as a product smaller case longer battery noise cancelling more powerful clearer transparency but if you're basing your purchase decision on value i find the evos very compelling because it's so close to the sony's in all of those areas including sound quality its call quality is better and it's got multi-point pairing being able to switch seamlessly between two devices taking phone calls on one listening to music on another adds a lot of value for power users in fact come to think of it this product kind of reminds me of the soundcore liberty 3 pro really leaning in on that value proposition but off the top of my head i will wreck the liberty 3 pro just above the one more evil nani simply because i prefer the 3 pros tuning did i even need to tweak it out of the box the sound cores sound exactly the way i want it and it's cheaper than the evos that's more value right there if you want to know more about the level three pro watch this video over here but if it's a more laid back sound signature you want that's closer to the sony's the one more evos are

Buy LG TONE TF8, hi everyone and welcome to the channel lg have been quite busy lately as they did not only announce a new flagship set of wireless earbuds the tone 3t90 which is crammed with unique and useful features but they are launching another model as well which is more geared towards physically active users as it's more robustly built it has an ip67 waterproof rating it comes with ear wings for a secure fit during exercise and it shares most of the unique and handy features with the flagship model so in this video i'm going to test the lg tone free tf8 sport earbuds [Music] as for the design the tf8 offers all the typical sport earbud features first there are these large silicone earwings or fins which we get three sets of these fins can provide you with an extremely secure fit even during the most intense workouts the design of the fins allows the air to flow freely which can help with the comfort of your ears maybe it doesn't sound like much but if you ever pushed yourself close to your limits in training you know that every little thing that helps you keep cool can make a difference so that's clever thinking from lg and after a couple of runs and workouts i can safely say that the comfort and the fit of the tf8 are both first class another clever move was to make the earbuds dust and waterproof the ip67 rating can guarantee that even dropping your earbuds in dirt or drenching them in sweat can stop the bots from pumping out your favorite tunes and if they get sweaty or dirty you can simply rinse them under tap water but keep in mind that even though you can submerge the earbuds into water they won't work for swimming as the bluetooth signals will more than likely be cut off as soon as your head goes underwater but you can use them for water sports such as kayaking with a peace of mind the buds are made completely from plastic which results in a low enough weight of around 6 grams each build quality is premium and i know that it doesn't mean much as it's just a matter of personal taste but i find the tf8s look refreshing and that applies to the battery case too it has this textured coating all around which gives it a secure grip in your hands the color combination of metallic gray and lime green lends the case a dynamic and fresh look and there are a few more things that make the case somewhat unique well two things to be exact one is the uv nano technology and the other one is plug and wireless if you are interested in how exactly the uv nano technology works watch my t90 review as i explain it there in detail but in short the built-in uv light can reduce bacteria by up to 99.9 percent both on the speaker mesh and on the medical grade ear gels all you need to do is put the earbuds in the case close the lid and wait for at least 10 minutes and the uv nanotech will do the rest and since we talk about sportier buds which will more than likely be exposed to all sorts of dirt and bacteria in a workout scenario it's handy to have the ability to not only wash and clean the buds but to also properly sanitize them after each workout as this combination might prove to be essential in the long run as far as the health of your ears go with that said i just want you to make sure that the earbuds are completely dry every time before you put them away in the charging case as the case itself is not waterproof and on to the other unique feature of the case we get plugin wireless which can basically turn the case into a bluetooth transmitter how it actually works i will talk about in detail in just a minute so we got all these extras built into the case but there is one feature that didn't find its way to the sport bots from the t90 and that's the qi wireless charging support for a price of around 200 or 180 pounds one would expect a feature like that but all we get is a usb type-c port on the back of the case however the 10 hours of single charge play time with two full charges in the case sound kind of promising or at least these are the official numbers without anc with anc on it's 6 hours for the bots themselves and 18 hours in total and my own battery life tests can kind of confirm the manufacturer's data as on ios using the aac codec at 50 volume and with anc turned off i was able to use the earbuds for 9 hours and 42 minutes with the active noise cancelling feature turned on the single charge battery life dropped to 6 hours and 23 minutes these are good results as they are comparable to the best premium sport earbuds that are available on the market today a five minutes quick charge can give us an hour of views which can be used as a last resort before a workout when we realize our earbuds are dead just before starting a warm up before running by the way you do warm up every time before your workouts don't you well consider this a warm up so now we can move on to connection which is our main set for today's workout you know what i mean so first we get the latest 5.3 version of bluetooth with support for the sbc and the aac audio codecs pairing is easy with both android and ios devices i had no connection issues whatsoever during my own tests lag is non-existent with videos and you get a game mode switch in the app which can turn the sport earbuds into an esport gaming headset and even though we don't get all the fancy connection related features of the flagship t90 such as aptx adaptive or snapdragon sound i'm glad to see that lg kept two of them with the tf8 one is the multi-point and multi-pairing support which means that you cannot only connect to two devices simultaneously with automatic switching but you can also switch manually between the last five connected devices easily using the lg smartphone app and the other feature is the plugin wireless which turns the battery case into a bluetooth transmitter using either the 3.5 jack audio or the usb a to usbc digital cable you can connect basically any device to the case through its usbc port and then you just flick the switch on the side of the case and your earbuds are connected wirelessly to your source it can be particularly handy in a gym where there is a lot of equipment with a headphone jack so you can use the treadmill or the cross trainer with your bluetooth headset without having to deal with long cables tangling between your head and the machine so there is bluetooth 5.3 multi-point multi-pairing plug-in wireless and the bot can also be used in mono mode quite an impressive list of connection options if you ask me and now let me give you a quick audio sample from the dual mic setup on the tf-8q so you can hear how the bots perform during a phone call in a quiet room my voice sounds natural and it's easy to understand and that doesn't change significantly even when i turn on some loud ambient noise on the speakers in front of me the background noise is kept at bay and my voice is still relatively easy to understand apart from my accent maybe but it has nothing to do with the earbuds themselves and now i'm outside on a windy day standing next to a busy road so you can get an idea of what to expect from the spf apu in terms of voice transmission quality in such condition next up are the touch controls i know some of the hardcore fitness enthusiasts prefer having physical buttons on their earbuds as they tend to work better across all scenarios with sweaty fingers and whatever but i gotta say that the touch controls on the tf8 work extremely well i had no issues during everyday use or during my workouts either all sorts of functions are available such as playback track volume ambient mode and voice assistant controls and we can also remap all these functions in the app more details on that in my t90 review as the two things are basically the same i would only bring up one slight issue and that's that the touchpads are so sensitive and they are quite large in size too so the single tap action can be easily activated unintentionally during a workout but you cannot only deactivate the single tap action on each but independently but you can also lock the touch pads all together if that's what you want the same goes for the smart sensors and auto play pose you can disable it in the app so the bots won't pause media playback when you take them out of your ears and since we talk about the app already let's see what other features and settings are available in there first you will need to know that if intelligent sorting is enabled then the software will prioritize features that you use more frequently and display those on the top you can move around each feature manually yourself if that's something you would like to play around with so in my case now you can find the meridian audio presets or hsp modes on top with the two custom sound profiles below next are the three anc modes and the tone free lab which has the game mode switch and the uv nano switch inside further down you can find the menu for multi-point and multi pairing where you can do all sorts of connection wizardry such as switching between your previously connected devices including the battery case itself then there are some switches for the auto play pose the touchpad lock and the intelligent sorting and then you can find the touch control remapping menu the software update and the find my earbuds options the app has a wide range of settings and features and it's quite easy to use so the tone free app is another highlight of the airgtf8 buds the active noise cancellation on the other hand is a tiny bit underwhelming all we got is three modes a and c on a and c off and ambient modes to be fair there are two different ambient modes one that lets you hear all of your surroundings and another one which focuses on higher frequencies so you can hear human voices better and that feature is quite intense so you can carry out a conversation easily without having to remove the earbuds from your ears windows can get quite strong and distracting in either of the ambient modes and since sporty earbuds like the tf8 are meant to be used outdoors a lot that's quite an oversight on lg's part in my opinion there is no dedicated wind noise reduction mode so the second best option i found during some of my runs was turning the asc off completely so i could get rid of that whistling noise of course in this case you will lose some of the situational awareness which is at least questionable from a safety point of view but that's a trade-off you might need to make on windy days with the tf8 the noise cancelling performance itself is good and it's on par with the best premium sporty earbuds out there such as the beats feed pro the jaybird vista 2 or the jabra elite 7 active strangely enough the tf8 can handle higher pitch noises better than most but it struggles a little bit more than the average with those lower tone hums and rumbles but the overall noise cancelling experience with music on is very similar to other buds i just mentioned from its class and the six millimeter dynamic drivers can deliver the sound you would expect from a set of sport earbuds it has a robust bass with a good kick in the low end it's a powerful and rich sound with full of energy in the bottom octaves but that extra energy does not get carried over to the mid range as we get slightly recessed walkers and acoustic instruments that sound a touch less lively than what i would prefer there is nothing wrong with clarity but the sound is not quite as open or forward as an absolutely balanced presentation would require it to be and the highs while being present we don't get enough micro detail there and the highest frequencies feel like a bit tamed or rolled off a step too soon that's not necessarily a bad thing though as this sort of a tuning is perfectly suitable for workouts plenty of energy we can get from the base without the fatigue the shrilling highs could potentially cause and this is a winning combination towards the end of an intense workout where all you need is that energy without the extra fatigue if you know what i mean the sound stage is not the widest i've heard with only an average separation between the instruments and the imaging could be just a tad more precise too but i only got these results using the natural eq preset which is one of the five dsp or hsp modes meridian created specifically for lg with the immersive mode you can somewhat widen or expand the sound stage the treble boost can give you more extension in the higher octaves and the bass boost can make the bass response even stronger not that i personally ever needed it but you might prefer a bit more of a punch for your favorite workout playlist the 3d sound stage is the only one i wouldn't use as it sounds terrible in my opinion but the other four presets can give you a wide range of options as far as fine-tuning your earbuds and on top of all that you also get two custom eq profiles in the app where you can manually tweak the sound to your liking using the multiband equalizer and these options should be more than enough for almost everyone to make the tf8 sound the way they personally like the most maximum volume is plenty loud but there are louder earbuds on the market for sure and to conclude this review suffice it to say that i just found a new contender for my best sport earbuds of the year comparison because the lg tone free tf8 can deliver a great overall performance and it can offer a plethora of features among which there are a few unique ones too plug and wireless you we nano the ear wings and the ip67 rating are perfect examples of features that os port earbuds should come with in my opinion multipoint and anc are useful extras too however i wish that the engineers had put more effort into dealing with wind noise both on the hardware and on the software front but then there is the long enough battery life the secure and comfortable fit and the greatly customizable sound so it's certainly a complete package that is worth having a look at in case you are on the hunt for a new set of sport earbuds the price is 200 at the launch which is thirty dollars less than that of the edgy tone free t90 and in my personal opinion it makes the sport earbuds a better buy you might miss out on some extra features such as wireless charging optics adaptive or dolby atmos support but i'm willing to give up any of those for a more secure workout approved fit but that's just from somebody who uses sport earbuds mostly for exercise and maybe that's why i'm always somewhat biased towards sport earbuds however for more casual users the t90 is still a superior alternative but regardless of my personal taste it's obvious that lg upped their true wireless game with their latest release of two exceptionally feature rich earbuds and this was my review of the lg tone free tf-8 but before i sign off i have to tell you that i got free samples from edgy for this test but no money exchanged hands and nobody had any influence whatsoever on what i was saying to you about their product so if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already i talked a lot about the other newly announced lg buds so if you are interested in more details then go and watch my t90 review as well link is up there and also in the description thanks for watching see you next time you
Buy LG TONE TF8, y'all ready for this lg sponsored this video because they're trying to get in your head with the new tone free wireless earbuds there's two types guys the tone free fiat also known as the tf8 and the tone free non-fit also known as the t90qs don't call them that check out this cool knife that andy has he should sharpen this one so the t90q regular tone free is the more premium ones so let's open them first really digging this cardboard packaging it looks very compostable here we go and then what's under here oh a bunch of stuff this is your charging cable it's usb c to a and then here's a not regular thing it's a usbc to 3.5 millimeter like audio jack and this is interesting because it's a feature of the case on both of these earphones where let's say you're in a plane it doesn't have bluetooth or has really crappy bluetooth what you do is you plug the case into that source like your airplane armrest and then it'll feed in analog to here and then the case will act as the bluetooth transmitter to the earbuds that you're wearing so that is super cool and super useful when you're in a bind your phone dies or airplane mode or whatever you can watch movies not have to use some crappy other airline provided headphones that's awesome comes with some extra ear tips these are special ear gel tips that we'll talk more about in a minute and on the inside of this actually smaller than it looks in the picture case it's like these the size of like a what are those called macrons those expensive cookies weird there's like a little switch on it that looks like a audio jack i think that's probably to do with this guy there's your port and then there's a little uv nano light what i said about these these are i think called ear gel tips and they get cleaned by a light inside here so over the first 10 minutes of charging this light will shine and will clean the ear tip just the ear tip part which is pretty cool a little bonus i'd say wouldn't buy it for that but bonus 99.99 percent of bacteria killed by this light you can see the sounds by meridian these are pretty slick they're really glossy and smooth they're very light 5.5 grams on each earbud sporting a lot of battery life nine hours of playtime on the buds and their words not mine an extra 20 hours of juice in the cradle lg claims that these are super comfortable for all day listening and the lightness is a part of that now how do i pair them i guess i'm supposed to have these in here here they are connect set them up let's do it oh there's a user manual one touch is going to answer a call or player and pause touch twice to end a call and do volume control that's interesting uh i guess this will be a double tap on one for up a double tap on the other for down touch three times to play the three times for the next song you're breaking convention there usually that means back long press is for ambient sound noise cancelling on models that support it what's page two of this manual connect the cable i know how to charge you guys oh here's what these lights mean green light when you have more than 80 battery yellow light when you have 22 80 percent and red light when you have less than 20 you just want to stay in that yellow zone that's how you're going to preserve your battery life so if you're using the cable thing plugged in then your touch controls kind of change it'll be one touch for play and pause and touch twice for volume control and i get and that's about it yeah that makes sense you can't control the source as much as you could okay so there's some eq settings here immersive natural treble boost bass boost 3d sound stage natural mode delivers authentic and balanced sound that toast i can't read that fast it's gone now this is like the big feature of these dolby atmos head tracking on wireless earbuds let's do it earbuds track the direction of your head giving listeners the immersive feeling of i couldn't finish reading that guys i'm not a speed reader it's the feeling of being in a concert hall or a theater so the idea is that the audio is kind of fixed in place spatially so if i'm sitting in a home theater and i have surround speakers and i hear a little mosquito buzzing by over here i turn to look it's still going to stay there it's not going to track my ear that's what would happen with normal earphones so with these i can go what's that and look at nothing but it'll sound like i'm getting closer to it holy these are blasting right now these definitely go loud i'm only at halfway i don't even want to go this loud whoa this is super special he's like take that breath and it's like bouncing around like a different corners of my brain over the top that's pretty cool and he says i listen to music too loud tap tap it goes down a step tap tap goes down a step that's cool okay i'm looking forward the voice is kind of like right here my forehead now it's over here it's still there it's like there's a tiny weekend just standing on an invisible stage over there you know like in the songs the studio where he goes like this is a studio to different ears you can do that yourself every song can beat the studio you go i guess there's a cool feature with the noise cancellation where it will detect the sound around you the noise level of the sound around you and it'll ramp up or ramp down how aggressive the active noise counseling is you're walking down the street and suddenly you're in a construction zone what do you do don't fall down the hall it will increase the sound of the anc to compensate for that so that's cool there's two microphones on the outside and then there's two microphones on the inside for a total of four noise canceling mics on these bad boys of course there is a transparency mode so you can see in the app here it says noise canceling which is on right now always canceling off gives you a little kind of sound and ambient sound actually two different ambient sound modes have come up now this listening mode says you can hear ambient sound while listening to music or this conversation mode you can hear the voice more clearly i don't want to talk to people i want to listen to music yeah that works pretty well uh switching conversation mode uh yes jake bell you're doing a great job you're too far away dang that's too bad i wonder how you would sound if i turn this off hello i'm talking again you sound kind of the same another really cool feature that i've never used before is whisper mode so you can take one earbud out and basically just use it as a microphone looking really cool on the skytrain there's a guy over there he's only wearing one sock and so you're listening through one and you're and you're just speaking directly into another one so your mouth is that much closer to the microphone pretty cool and here is an audio recording of what the microphones sound like all four of them i can whisper a little bit i can get really gravelly or you know maybe i'm not used to that got em and that is them they have these cool graphene that's right the g word graphene drivers super stiff so that you know they're saying that makes it more accurate and less distortion very cool ipx4 rating which is pretty typical on wireless earbuds means that um you can sweat in these puppies they're gonna be fine some splashes they're okay however if you think for 229 you deserve more than ipx4 then you know what spend 200 and get the tone free fits with ipx7 when you put it in the wrong ones let's check out the tone freeze they're for fitness fitness this whole macro into my mouth hold on this is a different looking case it's bigger it's got a lot of same features it's got the little switch guy and the plug kind of different finish on it this is just really smooth and matte this is almost like woven but it looks super tight cool though very very fidgety oh look at that nice little lime inside and here they are they got the uv thing as well no dolby atmos on these things but you'll see that they do have this like special little little under the sea it's called swivel grip technology folks there's a lot of friction because that it's like this silicone fin and it's in contact with your ear across this entire length so it's really very secure sticky there they're in there damn it what if i had my hands tied behind my back i can't take them out they're just i'm under arrest and my ears are blocked look at that it says around the box ip67 i said x7 before that was wrong six seven so they do have maximum dust protection six is the highest rating of dust protection so yeah these things are hardcore they also have noise cancellation they also have the meridian audio how about battery life on these also 20 hours of juice in the cradle but a little more on the buds 10 hours on the buds and as i tap it it's going to take you're not connected to anything though but the surface that your finger lands on is pad just wants to land on that it's just like shaped like a finger boom all right that's it for these guys 200 for the tone free fits 229 dollars for the non-fits check them out at lg's website you can see that link below and thanks to lg for sponsoring this video if you didn't like those cables in white we got them in black too like and subscribe isn't this a great channel
Buy LG TONE TF8," these are algae's first sports earbuds they are 
called the tone free fits or the tf8qs they do   have a and c now with that anc on you get up to 
six hours of run time on a single charge and then   18 including the case now if you turn off the anc 
then you get a very long 10 hours of run time on a   single charge and 30. now they are ip67 waterproof 
so you don't have to worry about getting them wet   you can even clean them and wash them down with 
water if you happen to get a bit of sweat on them   or something or dirt it's not going to be an issue 
they are tuned by meridian we do have with these   a plug-in feature that you can actually run them 
with older tech so imagine you've got a psp but   it doesn't have bluetooth but you want to use them 
or you can use the cable that's supplied plug them   in and you're able to use them so a handy little 
feature there they also do have their uv nano plus   so now it has improved so it's actually just 
killing the bacteria that are on the tips the   whole silicon tips and also the mesh inside now 
i did want to make it very clear full disclaimer   that this is a video sponsored by lg so it is 
just an unboxing and hands-on included in the box   obviously we have the time free fits they've got a 
type c to usb cable type a type c 2 3.5 millimeter   some swivel grips so they are air hooks you use 
those we'll try different ones out to get the best   fit for your ears and then we do have some medical 
grade silicone tips so two smalls two large and   a simple owner's manual these earbuds according to 
my scales they weigh six grams each and your total   travel weight with the case is 56 grams the case 
is really nice high quality it's got this texture   to it as you can see feels good in hand and what 
i do like about it is it doesn't seem to scratch   that easily or pick up fingerprints so there is 
a magnet that does hold the lid in place and it's   got a nice feeling to it when you open it up and 
when it closes it won't just flop open and if i do   give it a bit of a shake there is no rattling that 
is happening at all so we do have two status leds   here the one at the front will tell you the case 
battery life there is the one there that states   uv nano so that is to do with the uv lights that 
are inside those lights are not these blue leds   that you currently see it is the one right in 
there so what it does is it does kill all of   the bacteria when it's charging and it activates 
it takes 10 minutes all the bacteria that is just   on the tip and then the mesh inside then along 
the back we have our type-c port those magnets   do keep the earbuds in there really secure and 
it does feel nice when you place them in and it's   very easy to tell them apart they are labeled 
left and right on the back so pogo port pin   connector right there for of course charging them 
so the build quality of the earbuds is very good   the plastic i do like there are no sharp edges 
so this is interchangeable what they call their   swivel grip which is an air hook there so the 
idea is that that fits in really snug into your   ear and it's not going to go anywhere when you're 
running when you're jumping up and down and it   does have the little slots in there the gaps for 
ventilation a little bit so it's to help keep your   ear a little bit cooler so these silicone tips as 
mentioned they are medical grade ones and we do   have a little mesh that's in there to cover over 
that so it doesn't end up getting wax inside or   anything like that so there's a sensor right here 
that is used for the auto play and pause when you   pull them out or put them back in so it can start 
there got microphones capacitive touch controls on   the back another microphone there that you can see 
one at the top and overall the plastics used are   good it seems to be like a painted plastic there 
and so far using them it hasn't marked or anything   and our application for them so it is called algae 
tone free the app and you see straight away our   battery life of the fits that turn three fits and 
then the case has 47 percent there they do have a   guide okay that's how to insert them you just need 
to swivel them up a little bit to make sure that   they have a solid fit and there's other things 
like the capacitive touch controls too by the way   so it's good that it's got all this information 
built into it and it even gives you their guide   on the charging case status led to let you know 
at first glance what you have remaining with its   battery life you've got equalizer settings for 
some reason out of the box they put it onto base   boost i guess for the general public so people 
will like the way they sound that the oh these   are bassy but you do have here some custom presets 
as well that you can go along and just tweak that   firmware updates there has been one already good 
to see and we've got our settings here for the anc   and the ambient modes you can do it via the 
app or you can do it via the touch controls   multi-point and multi-pairing so you can turn 
this on you can have up to five different devices   using the app that you can connect these up to 
which is really good another nice little handy   feature to have the autoplay pause and there's 
quite a few other settings in there as you can   see so it's quite a fully featured app onto our 
audio now with them so we do have the aac codec   support which most phones will be using with 
this so iphones ios and then android phones most   of them do support aac if whatever you're using 
doesn't support it then you fall back to the sbc   codec which is not quite as high quality so if you 
can do try to use aac so that tune as i mentioned   before is by default set to the bass boost mode 
now they only have six millimeter drivers within   them but the tune is from meridian and that's 
british company they've got many many years   in tuning audio experience uh and well i think 
it's a very good tune that they have gone through   for here with these so the balanced more natural 
mode preset i do prefer because they haven't gone   a little bit well they haven't obviously bolstered 
up those lows and it does sound yes as it states   it is more balanced which is quite a good tune 
but there's a lot of different presets in there   and i think all different genres of music which 
of course i've been listening to with these they   do sound good considering that these are fit 
active sports style earbuds the algae tone free   fits of course the tf i think most people will be 
happy with the way they do sound those lows the   mids vocals highs aren't very detailed that's one 
area where i would say they lack a little bit how   about streaming content and the latency is there 
a noticeable big delay well with using this phone   here which is powered by the qualcomm snapdragon 
8 gen 1. i don't really see that much of a delay   a split second sometimes with streaming content 
so stranger things things right here with netflix   it's fine i think it's acceptable for watching 
content like this however when you game though you   will notice a bit more of a delay with the latency 
which is normal i've also been out now for a bit   of a jog to test out how these fear the algae tone 
free fits so they haven't popped out on me once   they do feel secure they fit in there really nice 
so you can jump up and down like now they're not   going to pop out on me i don't feel like i need 
to keep pressing them in and just a bit of a run they are not going anywhere and because they 
do have an ipx67 waterproof and dust resistant   i don't actually need to worry about them 
getting sweat on them not an issue at all   here is now an audio sample with the lg tone 3 
fits the tf8 cues so they do have some active   noise cancellation going on and the voice quality 
should be reasonably clear as you can hear i don't   think it's that bad so if you are running along 
and you have to answer a call with them of course   you are able to do so so it should be removing 
some of the background noise you can hear from   my tower pc and the air conditioning fan unit that 
i have up on the wall like most of these bluetooth   earbuds now when you open the case they have 
already pretty much paired up with your phone so   inserting them in just give them a little bit 
of twist when you put them in the air hooks   for me the mediums have worked the medium silicon 
tips with my ears of course everyone's different   so make sure you get a good seal anc the anc on 
these works really well i cannot hear background   noises like noisy cicadas outside singing away 
noisy fan towel pc completely blocked out now   one thing to note with the ip67 water resistance 
that it does have that of course you don't need to   worry about getting them wet you can even wash 
them down with water after they're all sweaty   now if they do detect they've got a bit of water 
in them they turn on a very high pitched frequency   just to help get that water out of them completely 
to really just empty them out from where that   driver is if you do get a little bit in there so 
it's six millimeter driver tuned by meridian so   i really i like the tune of these i think 
for sports earbuds they are good so they've   got a lot of features we've got the anc 
you've got of course the ambient noise mode   we have the uv killing the uv nano there 
to kill the bugs on the tips and the inside   mesh that's great and the wired mode very 
handy with the case so you can use it with   older tech so they really do have a lot on offer 
excellent build quality and if you're not using   the anc all the time maybe you're running and 
you don't want to block out background noises   then you get up to 10 hours on a single charge 
so fantastic battery life with these so thank   you so much for watching this video hands 
on of algae's new tone free fits the tf8q"
Buy LG TONE TF8, all right guys so this video is sponsored by LG as this is the second pair of earbuds that we're going to talk about today and the pair that we're gonna check out is the new LG Tone free fit and more specifically the model is the tf8q now this pair comes in at 199 but the difference between this pair and the original tone freeze is this one is aimed more at being active this is a sport style earbud as it comes with ear fins that help keep these in your ears but it also comes in with an IP67 rating so uh not only is it dust proof it is also waterproof and that just kind of gives you peace of mind if you're going to be using these Outdoors which obviously this pair is aimed at so you don't have to worry if it starts to rain you don't have to worry if you sweat heavily and you still don't have to worry if you just happen to bump them out and they fall into the water so you generally don't get a waterproof rating with a pair that has active noise canceling let alone a pair that has very effective active noise canceling because I feel like the noise canceling on this pair is very comparable to other ones in this price range and it also has a very impressive ambient mode so again if you're going to be using these Outdoors you can hear your surroundings where it sounds pretty natural and it doesn't have that digital sound and it also has a chat mode which allows these earbuds to kind of focus in on somebody's voice somebody that you're talking to where it makes it easy to carry on a conversation without actually taking these earbuds out and some other features that these have is it does have the Google Fast pair and the Microsoft Swift pair so as soon as you pop open the lid to the earbuds if you have an Android phone you'll see the connection pop up right there on the screen and the same thing if you're using a Windows PC you'll see the connection pop up on the bottom right side of the screen and this just makes it easy to connect and get going and speaking of the connection this pair also has multi-point pairing so you can connect to more than one device at a time and I love this feature because if I'm watching a movie on a tablet or doing something on my PC and listening to something if a phone call comes in it will just allow me to easily switch over and take that phone call without having to go into settings and just manually disconnect from each device now this pair does have Bluetooth 5.3 and it doesn't have any high-end Bluetooth Kodak playback but it does have AAC and SBC and luckily throughout my testing I didn't have any kind of compression issues and I also didn't have any lag when it came to movies or videos now there is a slight lag with gaming but the huge plus with this pair is it does work with LG's app which not only allows you to keep these earbuds updated but it also has a gaming mode that you can switch these into and that just kind of helps cut down on any kind of lag and that just made things so much better even with using these with gaming but also within the app it has a find my earbuds feature so if you happen to misplace your earbuds it will help you locate them it also has some different EQ settings some pre-built ones that you can switch between you can also customize the EQ settings if you want now there's also a 3D sound mode which is trying to help open up the audio a little bit more and then also within the app it gives you the ability to switch between those different sound modes that I listed earlier you have your noise canceling on you can just turn it off you have the ambient mode and then you also have that chat mode if you're going to be where you need to hear somebody talking and another feature that this pair has just like LG's other Flagship earbuds is it has the plug and wireless mode so basically the charging case that this pair comes with it allows you to plug in the USBC cable and then on the other end you have a three and a half millimeter headphone jack where you can plug it into an airplane's headphone jack you can plug it into exercise equipment or a gaming device and it allows you to wirelessly transmit audio just simply by using the case and that's a huge Advantage because if you're in those situations normally a pair of true wireless earbuds will not allow you to be able to use them but just by having that feature and being able to switch it on on the case just makes it that much more convenient now as far as what they've included Inside the Box you do get three sets of the ear gels they've also included three sets of the ear fins which again make it really convenient to keep these in your ears they've included the three and a half millimeter to USBC cables so that again you can plug these into devices that have a normal headphone jack and then as far as the charging cable it comes with a USBC cable and one thing that I found is very puzzling as to why it's not a feature on these earbuds this pair doesn't have Qi wireless charging and that's very confusing especially for repair that's in this price range but speaking of the charging battery life is very impressive but it's also a huge gap between using these with the noise canceling off and the noise canceling on because if you just use these with the noise canceling turned off you can get about 10 hours of battery life on the earbuds with about 30 hours total using the case but if you just use these with the noise canceling left on that brings the battery life down to about six hours on the earbuds and about 18 hours using the case so that is a huge gap but that also shows you that the noise canceling is very effective on this pair but if you do happen to pick the earbuds up and they are dead there is a fast charge feature although a very minimal one where a five minute charge will get you an hour's worth of use now moving over to looking at the case I do like the textured grip that it has on the outside it just allows you to have a better grip on the case and on the back you can see the USBC input for charging and then around on the side it has that switch that I was talking about earlier that allows you to put these into that three and a half millimeter under wired mode and then around on the front you have a single indicator light and this is what allows you to gauge how much battery life is left on the case now moving over to looking at the earbuds unlike LG's other Flagship models this pair does not have the stem style design it just has the simple earbud design and again because of that ear hook it makes it a very comfortable pair but also a pair that you don't have to worry is going to fall out of your ears the controls on this pair does use touch controls and because it works with LG's app you can go in and switch around some of the controls so that you can have control over everything that you need your play pause skipping your tracks forward going backwards and also your volume control but if you're going to have those controls do keep in mind you may have to sacrifice the ability to have your noise canceling and ambient mode switch so you might have to go into the app to actually do that when you need it but another feature is this pair does have have these smart sensors so if you do take your earbuds out of your ears it will just automatically pause and then once you put them back in it will just go back to what you were listening to now for you guys that do like to use your earbuds for phone calls just like the other LG models I feel like these do a very good job of picking up my voice and I also think even in noisy environments these do an excellent job of blocking out my surroundings but you guys can be a judge by listening to a test here so here is the mic test using the LG Tone free fit and again just like with the other LG models I think it picks up my voice very cleanly it does have a slight warm tone to it but this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call and so now here's the mic test for the crowd noise being played which you can hear here so this is what it would sound like if you were to take a call in the public so now let's talk about the sound and one thing that I found very interesting because you normally don't see this is LG has it where the bass boost EQ setting is turned on out of the box and again I think that's because this pair is geared more towards being a sport or athletic style earbud because usually you want something that's going to have a very Dynamic Sound which means a Punchy bass a bright treble and just something that's a little more in your face if you're going to be working out but even though the bass boost mode is on out of the box this is not a overly bloated type of bass it has plenty of punch to it but it's fairly quick it's not sitting around and it's not rolling over the mids and the highs because the mids came through clearly no matter what genre I was listening to and the treble has a very nice clean overall sound now this is not a bright or harsh treble I would basically say that they took the EQ curve and boosted the base halfway but they also kind of pulled the treble halfway to kind of balance that out and they only slightly boosted the mids just so that it didn't get buried especially if you're listening to something chaotic I mean I even think this pair sounded great with metal and some more chaotic genres it just didn't get congested or muddy and that leads to the fact that one thing that's very impressive about this pair is the Sound Stage and the sound Imaging now usually a dynamic sounding pair of earbuds tend to sound a little bit more closed in but this pair has a lot of space to it it is a very open sounding earbud and I think they did an excellent job of being able to tell where different sounds are coming from so my overall opinion is yes at 200 it's putting itself up there against a lot of the mid to Upper tier true wireless earbuds it is very puzzling the fact that this pair does not have Qi wireless charging which which I don't really understand the fast charge even though it does have one I feel like it's on the lower scale we've seen better on a lot of other models out there but I think the huge selling point is you're getting a sport pair of earbud that has very impressive active noise canceling it is completely waterproof which you normally don't see with a noise canceling pair of earbuds and a lot of the other things like the gaming mode if you're going to use these for media and that wired mode being able to plug into devices on top of just using these as a normal pair of true wireless earbuds is bringing some other features that those other earbuds in this price range don't have so I think from an athletic standpoint this is going to be considered one of the higher tier models that you can get and I think that they're bringing enough to the table and have a very impressive audio quality to Warrant that price tag but guys that wraps up my video on the brand new LG Tone free it again the model on these is the tf8qs thank you so much for checking out this video thank you so much for checking out all the other videos and as always make sure to stay tuned for more
Buy LG TONE TF8, the market of true wireless earbuds has grown exponentially in the last couple of years but not all these earbuds are created equal and if you want something that can meet the demands of your sweat inducing heart rate elevating muscle pumping workouts then I have a couple of recommendations for you so today we are going to have a look at five of the best sport earbuds you can buy hi everyone my name is Andy and you are watching Andy's tank tone [Music] and as you are supposed to do before every workout we start with a warm-up by introducing our contenders strictly in alphabetical order first we have the Beats fit Pro for not only Iphone and fitness enthusiasts but also for everyone who simply likes when things just work in contrast to that we also got the Jabra Elite 7 active for feature junkies and customization experts third there is the JBL reflect flow Pro for those who want something robust yet sophisticated next up is the LG Tone free tf8 with some truly unique and also very handy features and last but definitely not least we got the Sennheiser true Wireless sport earbuds for those who want high quality Bots for their workouts for maybe a touch less money and after a proper warm-up let's see our first exercise which is comparing the feet and the comfort of the Bots this is one of the most important attributes of any sport earbuds as in the absence of a proper and secular fit you cannot really move and exercise freely without having to worry about the buds in your ears and only when that first criteria is met can we start thinking about all the other stuff such as durability sound quality or features so I'm happy to say that all earbuds in this test can provide me with a snug fit and they are all comfortable to wear for the duration of a longer run session as you can see the only ones here without any art support or wings are the job robots but there is no need to worry as the elite 7 active comes with an ergonomic design and the special coating that can give me at least a super tight fit the job robots also sit quite deep in my ear canals maybe the deepest of them all so so that's something to keep in mind as it can be uncomfortable for some people the sennheisers can also go quite deep but they have these replaceable Wings similarly to the JBL and the algae which makes them secure and comfortable to wear you can find Wings on the beach too however these are not removable as it's kind of a one size fits-all solution test the good old Apple way of doing things I guess but the built-in fins are soft and flexible so I believe that most people should be able to find a good fit with the beats the jbr reflect flow Pro are the only ones that cause me some headache as even though there is a selection of multiple ear tips and wings in the Box I could not find the perfect fit for my ears not that it's loose or anything like that because the buds sit securely in my ears and I could do all sorts of exercises without ever dropping them but somehow the seal and the passive isolation feel less than ideal using bigger tips makes the seal better but then I lose the Comfort the smaller tips can give me but that's just my ears and your mileage might vary again all earbuds come with multiple sets of silicone ear tips the most interesting ones are the sennheisers in that regard as we get two different types of tips one that provides us with a better seal and one that lets in a more noise but these buds are also the only ones that come without active noise cancellation and we get no transparency mode either so the extra ear tip selection is only there to somewhat soften the blow another factor that plays an essential role in the fit and comfort of the earbuds is their weight neither of these buds are particularly small nor they are lightweight but that goes hand in hand with the more robust build quality I believe the Jabra and the beats are both under 6 grams while the JBL understand Anheuser are the heaviest and biggest of the bunch with the LG being right in the middle as a general idea if you have bigger ears you might want something bigger while smaller earbuds might suit people a bit smaller ears but the fit varies from person to person and even your own two ears can differ from one another with that said if I had to pick one that would either be the Beats or the algae which I find the most comfortable in my ears but again your experience might vary moving on to our second exercise let's talk about the durability and Ingress Protection sport earbuds are designed to withstand the adversities of a heart training session whether it's doing heavy lifting and sweating crazy indoors or getting caught in a shower while running outside so protection against the elements can prove to be crucial and that's where the IP rating comes into play the higher the number the better the protection the ip68 rating is pretty much the best you can get so the JBL reflect flow Pro is the absolute winner here these earbuds are really built like a tank well a tiny little plastic one at least the LG tf8 is not that far off with its own IP67 certificate with the Jabra coming in third thanks to its ip57 badge the ip54 rating of the Sennheiser Bots still proves to be sufficient enough when it comes to protection against sweat and splashes but the Beats fit Pro barely makes the cut here with its rather average ipx4 rating it means that the Beats fit Pro are the only ones in this test without any protection against dust that might not sound like a big deal to some of you but it can make a difference in the long run and the Beats being the most expensive of them all you might want to consider all your options right and about prices in general you might want to have a look at the links in the description for actual prices as these things can greatly vary depending on where and when you watch this video so you can get the most up-to-date prices by clicking through those affiliate links and who knows you might end up having the channel in the process by making a purchase another thing I have to mention is that even though some of these Bots are rated as a fully waterproof it doesn't mean that any of the bots on the table today can be used for swimming it's a limitation of Bluetooth tools rather than anything else and it applies to all earbuds basically but you have to keep that in mind nonetheless and since you will more than likely be sweating all over your earbuds at some point please make sure that you clean them after each use and only put them back in their carry case when they are fully dried because first with wet charging pins you can easily fry the batteries in both the Bots and in the case and second neither of these battery cases are actually waterproof to any degree however the LG case comes with a special feature called UV Nano which can kill 99.9 percent of bacteria on the speaker mesh and on the medical grade silicone tips in just 5 minutes it doesn't mean that you don't have to clean and dry your butt before putting them away but if you are prone to ear infections or if you are the tiniest bit obsessed with hygiene then the LG tf8 might offer you the best chance to sleep well at night and while talking about the cases the Jabra and the JBL are the only ones that can be charged wirelessly but all of them have a USB type-c charging port even the Beats which given its tight connection with apple is kind of a nicer price the USB port is hidden behind a little plastic door on the Sennheiser case which can stop dirt from building up inside the port over time all the other ports are exposed and unprotected so you better find a nice and clean spot in your gym bag for them and in case you want to hook your case onto your gym bag the jbr case comes with a built-in lanyard while Sennheiser also has a loop with a replaceable lanyard in the Box onto our next exercise let's discuss active noise canceling and ambient modes the former can be handy in a noisy gym while the latter can prove to be essential from a safety standpoint while you are exercising outside with other people or traffic around you but first let me remind you that the Sennheiser sport earbuds do not have any kind of ANC nor do they offer you any here through or ambient modes but neither have the Bose sportierbots and it did not stop me from featuring them in my best sportier but videos the last two times however in case of the sun is at least we get the different year tips but to be honest it can only make the tiniest bit of a difference in terms of our situational awareness so that's a bit underwhelming but all the other four Bots have a decent ANC with some sort of a transparency mode in my years I felt like the Jabra can block out the most noise across all scenarios second are the beats and the algae together with the JBL far behind in last place but the actual ASC performance of the beats and even of the LG is stronger than that of the Jabra but I got such an effective passive isolation from the deep seating snug fitting Elite 7 active that their overall noise dampening capabilities turned out to be better in my ears if that makes any sense but turning on active noise cancellation makes the biggest difference on the Beats followed by LG and Jabra is only third when it comes to wind noise with ANC enabled the best is Jabra followed by beats and JBL but the LG Bots are clearly the worst from that perspective transparency mode sounds the most intense on the Jabra at its highest setting but these are the only mods where you can actually play around with it using a slider in the app the Beats sounds a tad more natural but but it's also more muted in comparison edgy is again just a touch Behind These two but it has two separate modes one that lets true all sorts of frequencies called listening mode and another one that focuses on voices helping you having a conversation and while on the topic of having a conversation the reflect flow Pro besides its basic ambient aware mode also comes with a talk through mode which not only lets in ambient noise but also pulls down your music so you can have a quick chat with someone in the Jabra app you can set up the Bots to mute music when here true is activated which has a similar effect and in terms of Windows in transparency mode the job robots are the best making them the most capable and comfortable option for outdoor runners in windy areas where I live for example followed by beats JBL and LG in that order and in the following exercise we can give our ears some rest while we bring our fingers to work as we discuss the controls next we can split the five Bots into two groups here in the first group there is the Jabra and the Beats because they both come with actual physical buttons while the other three belongs in the group of buds with touch sensitive controls usually all these controls work pretty well under normal conditions but let's see if you are wearing a hat a headband or gloves for example touch controls might give you some trouble here and there and the same applies to greasy sweaty or muddy fingers so in any of these cases you might be better off with either the Jabra or the Beats I personally prefer the elite 7 active over the Beats feed Pro simply because I can fully customize the functionality of the controls in the Jabra app while beats only offers you some limited options also you can have access to play pause volume tracks ambient mode and voice assistant controls all at the same time on the Jabra but depending on your preferences you have to give up either volume controls or ambient mode controls on the Beats as you cannot have both working together the algae and the Sennheiser buds are up there with the Jabra in terms of customization and functionality and their touch controls work extremely well too during everyday use on the JBL you can choose from playback ambient mode volume and voice assistant controls but only two of these four can be active at the same time which cripples the functionality of these controls all Bots come with smart sensors except for the Sennheiser so you won't get automatic play and pause on the sport through wireless earbuds in summary if you want actual tactile buttons which work across all scenarios and under all conditions I would suggest you pick the Jabra but if you prefer controls my recommendation would be the LG tf8 next up is sound quality to keep things simple I did most of my testing with both ANC and EQ turned off with the only exception of the LG where I used the natural DSP setting and it was simply necessary because the Bots sound way too flat and uninspiring out of the box those Meridian presets were created for a reason and I also used the aware mode on the Sennheiser Bots as the focus mode affects the sound in the most undesirable Way by sucking out the energy from the base and turning everything down a notch and with that out of the way there is another elephant in the room I would like to address quickly and that maximum volume so if this is the only thing that matters to you then I would say that the Jabra would be your best bet closely followed by the beats with the edgy and the Sennheiser just a step behind while the JBL is clearly the last but again these are my years only so your mileage and preferences might vary and now on to the actual sound of the Bots being sportbuds bass might be something you don't want to skimp on and each of these Bots can deliver a Punchy and Powerful base across the board the Jabra stands out with its extreme low end extension and heft with the LG being second with its powerful and Rich bottom octave both the Sennheiser and the Beats can crank out thumping bass but things feel a bit more under control and also more balanced with the rest of the frequency range in mind jbr comes in last but it's hard for me to judge whether is the less than perfect seal that leaks the low end energy or they are not that strong in that department to begin with onto the mid-range the better control over the base notes pays dividends here as all three buds meaning the Sennheiser the beats and especially the JBL can leap forward and push the two heavy base heaters to the bottom of the list when it comes to recreating Walkers and acoustic instruments the Jabra and the LG are simply too recessed in the mids for my taste and so is the Sennheiser but maybe to a lesser extent why the reflect flow Pro and the Beats fit Pro can deliver a rich and Lively sound across all these frequencies if you want sparkly highs the Jabra is definitely on the top of your list but too much of a Sizzle in their sound can sometimes be fatiguing jbr comes in second with its energetic and detailed but not overcooked top end the Beats fit Pro is just a hair behind with an equally detailed treble but maybe it's a bit more smooth around the edges and the same applies to the Sennheiser the top end frequencies are rolled off a Touch Too Soon on the LG buds but again that's the natural DSP setting and other modes can give you the liveliness you might desire in that region in terms of the size of a virtual Sound Stage the LG is a bit lacking but it's not alone as both the Sennheiser and the Jabra sound a bit closed in and Center focused coming in next the JBL might have a bit of an advantage but the clear winners are the Beats as far as an accurate and spacious image is concerned in case you are not happy with the sound of any of the Bots out of the box they all come with some sort of an EQ with both presets and custom sound profiles except for the Beats Sennheiser have their sound check feature which makes you run through some tests to tailor the sound to your taste Jabra have my sound which essentially does the same but the whole process feels a bit more detailed with more accurate results edgy have 5 DSP presets which were tuned by Meridian but other than the natural setting they all feel a little bit over the top and way too processed the rift Light Flow Pro only comes with a few presets in the app but the 10 band manual equalizer is probably the best of them all and again other than the built-in audio presets on iOS the Beats feed Pro offers you zero customization as far as their sound if I had to pick I would find it hard to choose between the algae and the Beats but honestly all earbuds can be quite enjoyable during a hard workout and at the end of the day that's what matters the most and to shift the focus on endurance training a little our next exercise is a battery life you can see all the relevant data on the screen right now so feel free to pause the video if you want to have a closer look I would only highlight the fact that wireless charging is only available on the Jabra and on the JBL and also maybe I wasn't able to find any official information on it so I have to assume that the JBL is the only one without a quick charge feature of any sort but even if that's true given the fact that the reflect flow Pro can last longer than the others on a singular charge it will hardly be an issue in everyday use next up is kind of a mix of some other mostly connection related features that might be of interest to you so let's see what each of the Bots can offer in terms of these so-called extras now the only feature that all of the Bots have in common is that each and every one of them can be used in single or mono mode which means that one earbud is in either your left or in your right ear while the other is being charged in the case all of the Bots support both the AAC and the SBC audio codecs but you can only find app text on the sennheisers we talked about the special case of the tf8 before but what I have not mentioned yet is the plug-in Wireless feature which can turn the LG case into a wireless audio transmitter when plugged into any device with either the USB type-c cable or the 3.5 mil Jack audio cable both of which can be found in the box and that feature can come in handy on a treadmill or any equipment with a headphone jack in a gym staying with LG there is also multi-point which allows us to connect to two devices at the same time with automatic switching between the two and on top of that multi-pairing allows us to manually switch between the last five connected devices using the LG Tone free app both multi-point and multi-pairing work between all sorts of devices across all platforms the only other earbuds that can do multi-point with auto switching are the Jabra Elite 7 active while the Sennheiser smartphone app can offer you the manual switching option for the sport through wireless earbuds multi-point use or as Apple calls it automatic switching Works only with other Apple devices on the beatsfit pro audio sharing is also an apple exclusive feature which allows you to share your music with someone else who has a pair of compatible airpods or beats earbuds and as long as you live inside the Apple bubble you can also enjoy spatial audio and Adobe Atmos with head-tracking on the Beats fit Pro but none of these features such as audio sharing multi-point or spatial audio are available on Android both the LG and the jbr come with a low latency mode it's called game mode in the tone free app and video mode in the JBL headphones app JBL also supports the Google Fast pair feature which gives us a somewhat deeper integration with Android and that includes find my device as well which can help you locate your earbuds based on a GPS data but it only works on Android the Beats can do find my device too but only on iOS the Jabra app can offer you GPS based find my bot on both platforms and there is LG which can play a loud beep to help you locate your Bots as long as they are within range it works on both iOS and Android but there is no GPS assisted option and as far as the rest of the smartphone features go I would say that the Jabra sound Plus app can give you by far the most comprehensive list of options and settings followed by the LG the JBL and the Sennheiser and even though beats have an actual app for Android too it loses big points due to the lacking custom options and while making phone calls during exercise is pretty much at the bottom of my list of priorities here are some audio samples so you can decide which one you prefer in different conditions since you are talking about people here but I thought it would only make sense to test the microphone on the earbuds in their natural habitat so we are in a gym with some not too loud music coming from the speakers so this is the beat fit Pro and this is the microphone quality you can expect from these bugs in such environments next up are the Jabra Elite 7 active so this is the phone call Quality you can expect from these bots in a gym with some music coming from the speakers and this is an audio sample from microphones on the JBL wristlet flow Pro I'm still sitting in a gym and there is still some music blasting from the speakers moving on this is an audio center from the microphones on the LG Tone free PSA earbuds we are still in the same environment in a gym with some music and other environmental noises and plus this is what you can expect when you happen to make a phone call in a gym while using the Sennheiser sport to wireless earbuds there is still some music coming from the speakers and there are quite a few people training in the gym so there is summer background is noise for sure and even though I really hate taking phone calls when I'm out on a run here are a few audio samples for you starting with the beats with Pro with some heavy traffic and a slight breeze thrown into the mix next up are the Jabra edit 7 active I'm still running outside same conditions slice Breeze and some like traffic and now we listen in on the microphones on the jpr reflex flow Pro so this is what you can extract from these ones brand new happened to make a phone call while running outside with some traffic and some slight wind and this is the sound quality you get from the microphone on the LG phone 3df8 if you are fit enough to make a phone call while running outside and for our final test here is an audio assembled from the microphones on the Sennheiser sport to wireless earbuds again same conditions traffic as you can see and you can probably hear the slide is read as well through the microphones and even though I would like to leave the judging to you in terms of microphone quality there is a feature on three of the Bots that can easily tip the scales in their favor it's called sight tone on the Jabra and on the Sennheiser while it's called voice aware on the JBL and it allows you to hear your own voice on the Bots during a phone call on top of that the Jabra sound Plus app allows you to customize the behavior of the elite 7 active during a phone call to the north degree including button controls automatic answering or even eq'ing the voice of the person at the other end of the line the LG and the Beats come without side tone but at least you can change the ambient modes while on the phone on both mods which can be quite handy as well and now I feel like we can do a bit of a cool down and bring our heart rates down to normal before we get back to our daily routines so in summary I've got five exceptionally well-built earbuds all of which can be your next training partner but each of these training Partners have different personalities so each of them can be a good match to different people the Sennheiser 2 Wireless sport earbuds are like someone who go to the gym every day of the week but they only do the bare minimum it takes to stay fit and strong in the long run no less no more they don't spend their money on flashy and expensive clothing either and if you can share this minimalistic approach you can easily become good at gym buddies too not too many features but with all the basics done correctly at a lower price point could make the sun is an attractive option for many of you the JBL reflect flow Pro is that above the friend of of yours who knows what it takes to get through a tough and intense workout without any excuses and they also know all the little things that can make you a better athlete so it's worth listening to what they have to say plenty features and the different settings are on offer here with a good app a balanced sound and an exceptional build quality and all that for less than what most of the others cost the beatfit pro are probably the most exclusive type but even though they mostly prefer hanging out with their iOS bodies they can also work relatively well together with the Android guys out there whether you need a quiet companion with the best ANC or someone who talks through your workouts while making you comfortable and confident in your abilities you can count on the Beats of course if you want them to fully open up to you and get really close friends outside of the gym too you better be an iPhone user yourself with a deeper than average pocket the Jabra Elite 7 active is a bit of a control freak or the engineer type with all of its features options and little settings to play around with but when you enter the gym or head out on the track for some run intervals this guy turns into something of a low profile Beast who pushes you through your workouts without you ever realizing they are actually there the button controls the next level of customization does not fit the outstanding app and the great noise canceling along with the least annoying wind noise can make the job robots a good option for indoor and outdoor use both for sports and during Everyday Use and you get all the benefits on both Android and iOS this makes them one of the winners of this test the other one is the LG Tone free tf8 it's the underdog the lean quiet guy from The Office who you wouldn't expect to see in the gym but after a few training sessions together you really lies you might not want to train without that dude ever again they might be a bit obsessed with hygiene but if you think about it we can only benefit from a little bit of an extra care I guess loads of unique and useful features including multi-point and multi-pairing plenty customization an excellent app and exceptional comfort that first come to mind when I think about the tf-8 and if I want to be completely honest I could easily give them the overall win but the job robots perform better outside especially in windy conditions and that matters to me quite a lot so they have to share the trophy here and this was my recommended workout for you or my best sportier but comparison whichever approach you might prefer but regardless of what I call it please give the video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already some more sport headphones and earbuds comparisons are coming with ear hooks and bone conduction and open ear stuff so stay tuned but this is it for today thank you for watching see you next time [Applause]
Buy LG TONE TF8, last year i reviewed lg's tone free fp 8 and 9 which i think are some of the most underrated earbuds on the market they have a great all-round feature set and they're easily some of the most comfortable earbuds i've ever tested so i was pretty optimistic about what this year's successor might offer they're calling it the t90 or t90q so the naming system is still all over the place but they combine the best of the fba and nines into one pair of earbuds plus they add in this year's new features as well but perhaps more interesting than that is lg's entirely new sports model the tf8 these also feature lg's signature uv nanotech but offer a new wingtip design for a secure fit and boast a much higher water resistance rating so we're gonna get into all of the changes and improvements from last year's models the differences between these two and how they compare to the rest of the market so we'll start with the unboxings and straight away it's good to see lots of sustainable materials used for the packaging there's literally no point in wasting money harmfully making the box look all fancy because who cares what it looks like it's what's inside that counts and it's good to see more companies in the industry adopting this approach inside the box you first get the earbuds themselves we also have some different sized silicon ear tips as well as wing tips for the tf8 we then have two different cables one usb a2c for charging and the other is a usb c's aux cable for the plug and wireless feature which we'll cover later and finally we have the user manuals so the charging cases are the first difference between the two models there's the obvious shape and size difference but the t90 has a smooth finish whilst the f8 has a textured finish and both feel high quality the 90s have essentially the same case design as last year's models whereas the new f8 case is slightly larger to accommodate the wingtip design of the earbuds they're otherwise quite similar though with the battery and uv leds at the front the switch to activate plug and wireless at the side and the usbc charging port to the rear i like these cases because they're relatively small and compact especially the t90s the lids feel sturdy and the earbuds snap nicely back into the case with a secure click so the build quality is very good one key difference is that only the t90s support wireless charging sadly the sports version doesn't which is a shame the earbud design is the single biggest factor separating these two models because it affects the appearance comfort and the applications they can be used for the t90 has that airpods pro stem design very similar to last year whilst the larger f8 has a rounder galaxy bud style which most importantly has a wingtip to secure them in place for sports the t90s are essentially just slightly larger versions of last year's fp9s and come with a new all-gloss finish but they maintain that super comfortable form factor from before which are recently praised in the true wireless earbuds awards sure enough when you put these in your ears you can immediately feel the difference the t90s are smaller lighter and just gently rest in your ears i think last year's model just edged these for comfort but these are still some of the most comfortable earbuds on the market and can be worn for hours on end the f8s are not exactly bulky either but you do feel the larger size and extra weight thanks to the wingtips though these are much more secure and easily the better choice for sports they also have an ip67 protection rating so that's for dust and even submersion underwater whereas the t90 only has an ipx4 rating which means no dust protection and only sweat and splash resistance there's always a comfort trade-off with wingtip since there's more of the earbud that pushes against your skin but what you get in return is at least for me an unshakable fit that's ideal for exercising it's not just a wingtip though it's the shape of the earbud 2 that i find provides a really secure fit i quite like that these wingtips are vented as well to allow for more airflow during workouts a combination of the large ear tips and medium wing tips gave me the best balance of comfort and grip and these were absolutely fine to wear for a couple of hours certainly for longer listening sessions though the t90s are the better option the f8 tighter seal in the air also leads to greater passive noise isolation from your surroundings although with the larger rear tips the t90s do a pretty decent job with this as well incidentally the ear tips themselves are slightly different between models they're the usual round shape for the sports model but the 90s are oval-shaped they also have ridges inside which makes them super easy to swap in and out the eartips gently click into place a handy design i really wish all earbuds used it's a little more tricky with the f8s although swapping wingtips is nice and easy there's a marker on the earbud to help get them lined up perfectly each time the t90s touch controls are essentially identical to last year there's a small raised dot so you can feel where to tap on the earbud the controls are very responsive and give a gentle click when tapped the larger surface of the f8 mean the touch controls are a bit easier to use here and i also like that both of these have wearing detection for auto pausing and playing your music lg's excellent companion app provides good customization for the controls too allowing you to individually assign controls to each size you can also toggle the wearing detection feature and lock the touchpad controls which is especially useful when exercising to avoid any accidental touches you'll also see a nicely illustrated user guide including for how to correctly wear the earbuds for the t90 there's also an eartip fit test to help ensure you're getting the optimal listening experience though it's unclear why this isn't available for the sports model the lab features returned from last year as well and both new models can tell j's game mode game mode actually works really well and there's a noticeable reduction in latency when you turn it on but interestingly this is much more effective on ios compared to android so on my iphone i had no issues with watching videos and game mode allowed me to enjoy even fast-paced games like cod mobile on android it was a different story and there's still a visible delay even with game mode on i actually found myself keeping game mode turned on to improve the lip sync issues with youtube videos so that's likely a codec problem for android phones whisper mode also makes a return but again only for the t90s this limits the mic to the right earbud only and allows you to whisper into it for clearer calls in loud environments or simply to have a more private conversation a brand new lab feature available on both models though is an always on option for uv nano in case you aren't aware uv nano is lg's signature earbuds feature which uses uv light to kill up to 99.9 of bacteria on the earbud speaker mesh and now the ear tip as well in just five minutes the feature works seamlessly behind the scenes when you place the case on charge but the new always-on option means you can now activate it every time you close the lid not just when charging combining this feature with hypoallergenic eartips it's clear that lg is placing a focus on hygiene which companies don't often do so if you're someone who is prone to ear infections or just concerned about earbud hygiene then you especially might be interested in the earbuds usp now the final main app feature before we move on to the sound quality is for controlling the listening mode the transparency mode is once again excellent though largely unchanged from last year it very clearly amplifies your surroundings and there are two different modes to choose from conversation mode is supposed to amplify voices specifically which it doesn't really do everything is just generally more amplified but it's nice to have two different modes to choose from as for the noise cancelling this is also essentially unchanged so if you're looking for a big anc upgrade over last year you're not going to find that here the t90 is supposed to have enhanced adaptive anc that works even when the earbuds don't fit precisely in your ears but i couldn't hear any big improvement compared to the tf8 or last year's models the only thing that stood out to me is that it's no longer a hissing sound with anc so that's actually a small improvement otherwise the noise cancelling is decent though not amazing there are lots of other robots that perform better here in particular with regards to wind reduction but if you can get a good fit with these on a tight seal then they should block out a lot of sound passively i personally find the sports model are much better with this due to their shape i also like that there's a clear and distinctive tone that's played when you change modes on the earbuds it doesn't really interrupt your music but can still be clearly heard and you can now choose which modes to cycle between in the app in general the lg app experience is excellent it offers a nice and clean user interface is feature packed and even has small quality of life perks like battery tracking and automatically sorting the app features based on their usage speaking of battery life you're looking at up to 9 hours for the t90 and up to 10 hours for the tf8 dropping down to 5 and 6 hours respectively if you're using anc both offer around 30 hours in total which is not bad but the anc does seem to drain the battery quite a lot compared to the competitors the t90s battery life has actually dropped slightly from last year which is surprising given their slight size increase both of these provide an hour of playback from a five minute fast charge and again it's only the t90 that supports wireless charging now for connectivity this is where we get some of the earbuds best features in terms of codecs it's just sbc and aac for the tf8 but the t90s also get aptx adaptive with snapdragon sound this is the new codec that's supposed to deliver higher quality sound improved calls and lower latency as long as you pair the earbuds to a snapdragon sound phone i've talked about this in great detail in my neobit's s review one of the first pairs of earbuds to feature snapdragon sound and the upshot was that at the moment there are simply too few phones that support it for it to be worthwhile if you have a newer xiaomi or oppo phone then great you might be able to benefit from this but most of us won't be able to use it so i wouldn't say it's a big upgrade at all we do however get the latest bluetooth 5.3 which your phone probably doesn't even have yet and the super useful google fast pair this gives you very quick and easy setup on your android phone and the earbuds will actually sync to all of your devices signed into the same google account kind of like airpods with icloud accounts it also gives you location tracking with maps and battery tracking built directly into android so iphone users do miss out on a couple of cool features they don't miss out on the two best features though one of which returns from the fp9s which is plug and wireless so using that usb c to aux cable you can plug the case into even older devices and then stream its audio directly to the earbuds this is great for devices like aeroplane tvs and my old ipod shuffle which doesn't have bluetooth itself but i can bypass this by routing the audio through the case instead the feature is incredibly simple to use you just plug in flick the switch on the case and the audio switches over automatically when you're done you can flick the switch back and carry on listening to the music on your phone but my favorite feature is brand new this year and was at the number one spot on my wish list from last year which is of course multi-point and actually i think this is the best version of multi-points i've used yet there's first of all no need to press pause on the first device before pressing play on the other whichever phone or device i press play on is the device the earbuds switch over to receive audio from better still if i'm listening to music on one but get a call on the other the music automatically pauses so you can hear the call coming in before answering as soon as you press to hang up the audio automatically switches back and the music resumes you don't need to touch your phone once this has worked for me with tablets phones computers both pc and mac it makes the earbuds really convenient to use if i were to pick one minor criticism is that the earbuds aren't very good at reconnecting to both devices automatically when i take them out of the case they typically just reconnect to one device normally the first one i pair with and i have to prompt the second connection fortunately it's very easy to do this on the lg app all of your recently paired devices will appear in this spider web-like layout and from here you can select and manage devices to connect to it's a really well-thought-out system it's for me the best upgrade of the fp8 and nines and is so far putting most of the other multi-point earbuds to shame oh and this works on both the new t90 and tf8 just in case that wasn't clear now with phone calls there is a slight improvement with the new g90 cues they now have four pairs of mics and a new voice pickup units and what i noticed most is the improvement in isolation i'm in a reasonably noisy environment but the earbuds are doing a pretty decent job of isolating my voice from the traffic noise behind me switching over to the older fp9 hopefully you can hear how the background noise isn't quite as well isolated i tell it my voice is perhaps not as loud with the t90q but since the isolation is better they're usually the best option for calls in louder environments and finally switching to the tf8q these weren't quite as good as either the 90q or the fp9s which i suspect is due to them not having that longer stem design where the mic is closer to your mouth they still do a decent job with calls but notice muffling of my voice and the isolation from the background noise wasn't quite as good either and finally let's talk about audio quality where there are really just some subtle tweaks from last year the t90s have new 11 millimeter graphene drivers which are not only larger than last year's and deliver more powerful bass but they also reduce vibrations to provide cleaner and more accurate sounds you can certainly hear that in the bass response which is deeper but more controlled and that's the biggest change from the fp9s but strangely i'd actually say that the mid-range and vocals in particular are a bit more crisp and clear with the older model the sound quality differences are very subtle and i think you'll get the best listening experience pairing the new earbuds to a snapdragon sound phone for that high-res quality but again only a small number of phones offer this the fp9 sound really good though not spectacular like the market leaders and i can pretty much say the same again for the t90 once again the treble boost eq sounds the best for music 3d sound stage is a cool immersive mode for movies and games and listening with anc mode still gives a slight boost to the volume and bass as for the tf8 these sound even closer to last year's model and i'd say the t90 offers slightly more bass and volume in comparison there's a little bit more detail in the highs as well so it's almost like the 90s have a v-shaped eq whereas the sports model are perhaps a bit more balanced it's likely due to the differences in the driver but the sound quality differences are still quite subtle the bass thumbs pretty hard despite having smaller drivers and they give a pleasant possibly slightly warm sound signature that i'm sure most people will have nothing to complain about if you already own one of last year's models then there's no need to upgrade based on the sound quality alone but if you're looking for that same good quality but in a sports earbud that's exactly what the tf8 offers now one new and exclusive feature to the t90 is dolby atmos and head tracking this is claimed to be a world's first for dolby atmos wireless earbuds and it's pretty obvious that this is intended as an airpods pro spatial audio competitor you can now create a virtual surround sound like effect where the audio appears to be directed towards you from all around your head and with head tracking enabled the earbuds will change the directionality of the audio according to your position the feature works pretty well although occasionally the shifting of the audio between the left and right earbuds as you turn your head can be quite sudden and obvious especially on ios whereas i find it was a bit more subtle with android it's definitely a cool and immersive experience to try out but just like with spatial audio and airpods i personally think for music the experience is better with this turned off so for me it's not a deal breaker feature but it is something that's new this year and exclusive to the t90 model the t90s are launching at 199.99 so they keep the same price point as last year's fb9s whilst the sporty tfh will be 179.99 i said last year the lg's fp9s are a fantastic yet often overlooked all rounder so with the t90 closing the gap on flagship models with additions like multipoint and improvements to the mic and sound quality they're now a serious contender for being the best all-round earbuds on the market their signature uv nano feature helps to distinguish them from the rest of the competition they're some of the most comfortable earbuds out there but they can now compete across the board with the other specs and features too when you look at the overall changes and improvements from last year's models i'm not sure there's anything that would force me into upgrading straight away but combining plug and wireless and wireless charging into the same pair of earbuds was a very sensible move and adding in that excellent multi-point feature has ticked a major empty box from last year so the t90 are a much more compelling overall package that actually undercut a lot of the market leaders for price the one that stands out the most is apple's 250 airpods pro and there's no doubt that lg are trying to compete directly with those the feature sets are eerily similar from new additions like dolby atmos head tracking to reading out your phone's notifications to the very shape and size of the earbud itself the t90s are by far the closest competitor to airpods pro and by surpassing them in so many areas it's easy to consider them the real airpods killer in spite of apple's exclusive h1 benefits for iphone users it's hard to argue against lg being the better option overall the t90s sound better and more customizable and feature rich and are certainly a better value option for android users that's a no-brainer but even if you're an apple user you should seriously consider the cheaper but better t90s instead as for the tf8 there's a small list of exclusive t90 features that the sports model miss out on but none of this is a deal breaker in my opinion and they still have pretty much all of the best features anyway as a sports earbud they actually perform really well they have a very secure fit great water and dust resistance but they sound basically just as good as the flagship t90 there's really not very much to complain about and these are definitely one of the best sports earbuds available right now lg may not have the most effective noise cancelling the longest battery life or the best sounding earbuds which may be why they often get overlooked but considering the overall package these earbuds are tough to beat people often get drawn towards big names like sony bose and samsung for earbuds so i wonder if this year will be the year that lg finally gets the recognition it deserves because there's no doubt that their earbuds are well worth considering let me know in the comments if you'd buy a pair of lg earbuds and if you think there's a better all-round pair of earbuds right now then i'd be interested to hear your thoughts on that too give this video a like if you found it helpful and subscribe with notifications turned on so you stay up to date with everything on the channel thank you
