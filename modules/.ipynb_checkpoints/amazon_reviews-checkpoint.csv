2,First review was @ 11months. Now13 months & battery life is < 1hr,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/RTBTKIM2DIGRR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,22 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on November 27, 2022",2022-11-27,Canada,,"Edited again March 25th:A month after my last update Feb 13th, the Sonys are officially useless. Sharp drop-off from 2hrs use per full charge to about 15 mins per full charge.  Official ""new - to - dead"" lifespan: 14 months. Jabra Elite 85t's with slightly heavier daily use & 1 month older than Sonys: 3+ hrs of use on full charge, 3.5hrs if you ignore he 'low battery' warnings. Sony batteries are indeed inferior to Jabras. Jabras still occasionally have QC issues, but longevity of Jabras indicates a clearly superior battery.EDITED Feb 13, 2023:After fully draining the batteries & doing a full, overnight charge - I only get about an hour of music or conference calling (@ room temp, ANC always on) before getting the low battery warning - and 5 mins or so before they shut down. A very steep & early drop-off and an earlier ""end of life"" for earbuds that cost this much.I hope this helps people realize what sort of ""Birth to Death"" life you get from these under ""heavy"" use - 100% - %20 once every weekday & about 2hrs of use on weekends: 1 yr, 2 months & 10 days.I'm not ignorant of the fact Sony are facing very little battery real estate & the ANC/sound is top notch for the genre - but heavy use or not, I don't believe I got my money's worth here. I have a set of Jabra 85 Elites that face the same use, conditions & they're about 1 month older - I still get 4hrs out of them. I'm sure the Jabras will suffer the same fate as the Sonys eventually, but keep in mind, the Jabras have much better buttons & controls, are a better fit for non-sport use & are easier to take out of the case. They were also $100 (CDN) less than the Sonys. If I had to choose between the two brands again, I'd choose Jabra. Jabras have better bass & the only reason I can think of that made the ANC & sound better from the Sonys were the fact they air-locked in my ears. Not the kind of air lock that you can't jog with & block the ear canal, just a tight fight that felt better when jogging. Sonys felt bigger but lighter. Jabras are, IMO, the better product. Unless Sony improves the batteries' birth-til-death lifecycle, I wouldn't pay the same retail price they're selling for now.PREVIOUS REVIEW:Ear pieces included are comfortable & lock in place very well. Much better for jogging than my Jabra 85 Elites. These earbuds get heavy use - I iterate half a 12hr workday with Jabra, half with these Sonys.ANC & overall sound is better than any other ear buds I've ever used. The software is about 60% useful, 40% nonsense to get you to sign up to music services.Well known issue: Jabras offer the most commonly requested configs: Song pause/skip/repeat, volume up, volume down, ANC on, ANC off.  Sony, on the other hand, not as good. Buttons are touch only, not press. You need to use your phone/device to control volume, unless you give up song pause/skip/repeat.Sonys are annoying to remove from the case, the magnet's too strong & you can't grip them anywhere with dry fingers.Battery life: 11 months ago - 6-7hrs a day of calls, music, ANC on 100% of the time. Same usage this week, the battery life is about 3 to 3.5hrs before the low battery warning.Ear pieces: Originals are in tatters. They fit well in the beginning, but the plastic likes to flake apart. I keep my ears very clean, but wax will build up. Cleaning will ruin the ear pieces eventually, if sweat doesn't do it first. Pieces flake off in your ears, too, kind of gross. Good luck finding replacements of any actual quality (even similar quality). Sony might sell them, but their website is intolerable. Whatever you think these ear pieces are worth, quadruple it...In retrospect, my better ear buds are Jabra. That said, while bass is still better in the Jabras, the Sony sound quality is superior. The ANC (partly because they'll air-lock in your ear canal) is better in the Sonys.Battery life is barely 50% what they were 11 months ago. That's the biggest 'con' I can think of, but all other issues are just preference & aftermarket support. 3hrs is still convenient, but only because I have other ear buds to swap out. Wireless charging & USB-C are a huge plus. Neither the Jabra 85t Elites nor the Sony WF-1000XM4's are worth more than the other. If you find a discount on either model, take the cheaper ones.

You can miss it when you listening to music, too much going on there, but listen to anything with spoken voice such as a podcast, or an audiobook, or even a simple phone call, and you will hear it loud and clear. Updating, resetting, changing tips, changing audio source, even changing the audio stream, make no difference. None.The earphones I got had this metal echo on the left earpiece only. It drove me nuts eventually and I asked for a replacement from Sony. Sony's process was painless but took a while. When the new earphones finally arrived SURPRISE! Same problem, same earpiece, no solution. This appears to be an issue others have experienced as well: every product has its bad batches, but two pairs in a row, from different batches and different channels? Well, draw your conclusions.I spent some money on accessories for these earphones, which now I cannot get back, but at the very least I can get rid of the earphones themselves. This is not what I expect from a pair of very expensive quality earphones, especially ones that advertise outstanding sound quality. I can do much better sound-quality-wise from my old $100 pair, which I was trying to retire.It is truly said that this model is so defective, they have a lot of nifty little features and can articulate sound very beautifully.

It's faint, but super annoying.The noise cancelling seems decent, maybe equal to the pixel buds pro, and worse than its headphone counterpart.The ambient sound, from the 2 minutes I've tested this earbud doesn't seem too bad; it's better than the pixel buds pro's transparency mode, but in all fairness, the pixel buds transparency mode kinda sounds like you're underwater.The sound quality, from the two songs I've listened to on it, it seems like it has a lot of bass, which is what most people like. It sounds great, and I loved the part that it has no sibilance. It makes music very enjoyable and it a great product...if it weren't for the fact that the left earbuds emit a high pitched sound when nothing is played.Overall, I don't recommend unless you've damaged your hearing enough so that you can't hear above 15khz.Edit: Tried these earbuds again and noticed they don't sound good at all above 60% volume.

I was sceptical at first about getting the earphones, but I was amazed at how good the quality of the earphones was. Here are some of the pros and cons that I have soon discovered:Pros:- Opening from the package, I knew that the package was made with sustainable material and was not that pricey. I love this because I personally think that you do not need an expensive box which is gonna be used once. When you take the earphones out, you wouldn't even bother to do anything anymore with the box.- Inside the box, you will receive the different sizes of ear tips, cable and manual. You would be very surprised at how well they designed the box. Truly top-notch for Sony to be doing this.- One of the most memorable things when I was using this is that you would be surprised at how good the memory foam ear tips are. I went to the gym, took a run and moved a lot, but I have never needed to fix the earphones inside my ear. Amazing right? I have never found something that could fit very well.- The noise cancellation and ambient sound are good features added for the earphone. The noise cancellation is quite good for the very noisy places.- It has adaptive noise cancellation as well. It would cancel the noise as needed.- Sony made such a good app for the earphones though. It definitely spent a lot of R&D on the UI of the app. It was easy to use and very interactive- The touch sensor on the earphones are very adaptive as well. It is very comfortable to play forward, backward and play or stop the music.- Battery life is not bad.- Case has a two clutches for opening. Interesting design!Cons:- The ambient sound feature is not as good as AirPods Pro transparency mode. This is something Sony should definitely take a look at.- The touch sensor is not customisable. This is something Sony should fix so that we can choose the best that works for us.- The design of the earphones is something that Sony has to fix. It does not look super nice compared to many of its competitors. It is sticking out and does not look super good.- The case is pretty big compares to its other competitors. Sony should make the case smaller and easier to bring.Therefore, is this something worth buying and upgrading from your previous earphones? I think the Sony WF-1000XM4 is a good upgrade from your previous earphones. The price point is not that pricey, and all of the features from the earphones are super good. You would not find any earphones that are more comfortable and as fit like this.Cheers!

LDAC's higher quality bandwidth doesn't matter to me as I use Spotify (320kbps) but the lower latency with LDAC is noticeable compared to SBC or AAC.- Quality is good, they don't feel cheap/flimsy.- Noice cancelling is incredible - I was blown away coming from the Galaxy Buds Live. Transparency/ambient mode is good too.- Foam eartips are comfortable, however they do take a few days to get used to. These earbuds hurt in the first 2-3 days of using them until the foam adjusted to my ears.- These earbuds are maintained and updated, they received a software update at the end of February that enabled multi-device connection, meaning I can have them connected to my phone and laptop at the same time.Bad things:- Software is possibly the weirdest thing I have used in my entire life. It's not completely awful, but it's definitely not great, and some stuff is just straight confusing. Why is there a badges system for $400 earbuds?- There is a forced dominant earbud, whichever earbud has playback controls assigned has to be out of the case to use the other earbud. Basically, you can't use either earbud on their own, you need to have the one with playback controls on at all times.- You can't customize the controls themselves. There's only preset profiles (playback, noise cancelling toggle, volume, none) with preset controls. By this I mean you can't set the single/double/triple/hold tap to complete a custom action, you need to select one of Sony's set profiles. This is exceptionally annoying because I don't want the playback control hold tap to be the Google Assistant, I would much rather that be ANC/ambient and free up the right earbud for other controls.- Foam eartips flake really quickly. I clean my earbuds gently once a week with some Whoosh and a microfiber cloth, but prior to that I take off the eartips. So it can't be the cleaning that's wrecking the eartips, it's just basic use, and 2 months of use for some serious flaking is terrible.- Touch controls can get finnicky sometimes.- Earbuds are a little ugly and very bulky, but the leaked photos of the WF-1000XM5 look like they're solving this problem without destroying the unique design.- Case is pretty big by 2023 standards.Overall, they sound great, ANC is great, and they're relatively comfortable, but they REALLY need to improve on the software, tap controls, and the fact that one earbud has to stay enabled for both to work at all times.I can recommend these if you can get past the annoyances I talked about. I generally use one earbud so I can hear most of the world around me, but I might be an outlier, so if you use both earbuds anyway you should be good.I also recommend buying these from Amazon Warehouse Deals as I got mine for nearly half price and they still work/look/sound new.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],2,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3232,825,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 289.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds

4,Good after EQ and eartip change. Good features. Comfortable.,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R2J0YE9TZNM99V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,34 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on December 25, 2021",2021-12-25,Canada,,"This is the best TWS I've heard, but everyone who is using these with stock tips and no EQ and claim sound is good should not be trusted.With stock eartips and no EQ, the sound was disappointing compared to my Liberty 2 Pro. After EQ, sub bass is still not comparable to the Liberty 2 Pro, but everything is tighter and cleaner. Piano and high synth notes sound crisp and clear after EQ and tip change.For ear tips, it must be silicone for sound quality. I used one that came with my Liberty 2 Pro and it turned the XM4 into a new TWS in terms of sound.I only gave 3 stars for sound quality because it is unbalanced out of the box and sub bass is still a bit lacking after EQ, although it is adequate.Regarding EQ, 6.3k and 16k will need to be increased by a lot (or maxed) because stock setting was far too off. The other frequencies are up to preference and I increased 400, 1K, and 2.5K moderately. I ended up with +7 Clear Bass (even if I am not a bass head, bass is still important).After tweaking EQ, there was space and air in between quiet notes that fade and then come back. The EQ responds to your adjustments. It offers less bands, but it responds well to EQ and the bandwidth of the adjusted frequencies is moderate to broad, which is good. If it had parametric EQ, it would be best, but the other competition does not have that either.The volume when adjusted with the XM4's touch control seems to allow for a smaller increment, bypassing android's limitation (does not work on some apps). I don't know if Liberty 3 Pro has this feature, but this is a strong selling point for the XM4 and I hope future Sony products will keep or improve this feature. Most of the old apps that can do this no longer work, so it was surprising to see XM4 can do this out of the box.Fit and comfort were good with both tips, but much better and approximately ten times faster to put on with silicone tips. Compared to the Liberty 2 Pro, the comfort and fit was superior. Liberty 2 Pro relies on a wing tip that applies pressure and pushes the ear tip into your ear canal. However, the XM4 just fits snugly once inserted properly. Note that if you do not know how to fit it, then fit will seem bad.Seal must be tested with the Sony app, which is reliable. I kept running the test until it was clear that it sealed every time I put it on. The ear tip size is specific as a slight change in ear tip size will make the seal easier to lose. Liberty 2 Pro (not LIberty 3 Pro) came with way too many ear tip options, so I was able to find the correct one to use for the XM4.LDAC for XM4 (adjusted to prioritization for sound quality in developer settings and Sony app settings) used on Samsung S10E is far superior to Liberty 2 Pro. But on my laptop, likely on AAC, the sound is much better than LDAC on Samsung S10E. This tells me the player source is more important than the codec, but I have no idea what part of Windows is causing this. Either Windows is good, or Samsung is bad. However, the sound on windows without LDAC is better than the sound from Samsung S10E with LDAC.If your computer or device is newer, you will have bluetooth 5.2, which will be superior to AAC and basically replace aptx-adaptive. given that my laptop already produced better sound with AAC or SBS, it is probably not a big deal. There is a website that lets you listen to bluetooth 5.2 sound quality to compare.Despite all this, even though one can salvage the higher frequencies by cranking them up, I did not like that I could only increase back to acceptable levels within deviation for the price I am paying, so I decided to return the product and buy a more expensive wired IEM instead, as I already have a bluetooth amp/dac.

4,Decent wireless earbuds but not quite living up to the glowing reviews,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R1H1QWOBH5HPMP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,14 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on February 1, 2023",2023-02-01,Canada,,"I bought these earbuds since they were the almost unanimous choice for all reviews I've read. My previous/other pair of wireless earbuds are Jabra 75t, which are working perfectly fine. I just wanted a pair of upgrades.Based on that fact, most of my review can be taken as compared against the Jabra.The unboxing was a pleasant experience. Everything seems recycled and/or recyclable. Even the plastic casing of the earbuds and of the case felt biodegradable.At first, I struggled with finding a good fit. The memory foam tips seems less suitable to finding and maintaining the seal, comparing to the silicone tips most other earphones and earbuds I've used.Also, memory foam tips are just harder to clean than silicone tips in general.The size of the earbuds are also bigger than most, so they are more noticeable by passer-bys when you wear them. This could be a drawback or a bonus, depending on the situation.Once I was able find the fit, the noise cancellation was excellent.When I switch to ambient sound mode, I found the ambient sound more amplified, and I am able to hear more of the outside world.The earbuds battery, when either mode is on, don't last as long as my Jabra, which is slightly disappointing given the size of the earbuds.But the case's battery has a higher capacity. So long as you can (or willing to) take them off for charging for a short while, these earbuds could last a long time.The app... tries to do a lot, which I don't really enjoy. For example, the adaptive sound control automatically switch between noise canceling and ambient sound modes for you, but it tries to be so smart that it requires location, which I find intrusive for an app controlling a pair of earbuds. It also logs quite a lot of usage data, also concerning to me.And who decided an app for a pair of wireless earbuds need achievements?!All in all, while the sound quality is an upgrade, the fit and comfort are still below my Jabra, especially when I'm exercising. In general, I am using these Sony more, but I always keep the Jabra on hand and still use them at least 1/3 of the time.",True,Colour Name: Silver,[],5,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3232,825,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 289.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
4,"Amazing on AAC, can't say for LDAC",https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R3LD4A8AIW5291/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,9 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on September 12, 2021",2021-09-12,Canada,,"This is probably the first Amazon review Ive submitted; I don't usually leave product feedback but these were just so nearly perfect I had to leave a few words. I don't have an Android device, and am waiting for an LDAC transmitter still to be delivered so I cannot attest anything on that front. This review will solely be on the device's AAC performance.First of all - I don't know what these other reviewers are hearing, but the NC on these are superior to the WH-1000xm4s; I've done side-by-side tests near a fairly loud HVAC unit, near the street, and with a crying baby and these make what was measured by my ipad pro as 45dB sound like a soft hum, in contrast to the cans that leak a little rumble. With sharp, higher noises as well these were superior; you're still going to hear someone talking directly next to you but from around 5m away my wife has to yell to get my attention. This is probably because of the better passive isolation the in-ear offers over the can form factor. Haven't used them on a flight yet but I expect them to block most everything out. The NC has a bunch of functions, like a ""focus on voice"" that lets voices passthrough. The ""speak to chat"" feature is annoying, however, and is best left off especially with the quick transparency mode in the default configuration.One thing to be said for comfort, these earphones take a little breaking in, even after you find the right size buds for your ear. They are the comfiest buds I have ever worn, but only after day 3 or so. Before then I was considering returning them, even though the sound quality on these were better than any buds I have ever owned.The sound quality is just excellent, especially if you use DSEE with AAC. It's not magic, but it seems to smooth out the rough edges without diminishing detail. It does drain battery a little faster however. The AAC audio performance on these are far superior to Airpod Pros, which is to be expected as these sell for twice the price. What's odd is that I think these sound better on AAC than my WHs! Granted, the WHs over wired or on LDAC is on a whole another level but that seems like comparing apples to oranges. Like I said, I haven't been able to test LDAC on these yet but as far as AAC goes (which is what Apple users will be stuck with for the foreseeable future) these sound better to me than the WHs. The controls are somewhat customizable from a select list of presets and you can do almost everything you can on the WHs. Both buds are sensitive to touch and they are somewhat easily triggered, especially when laying down.The one improvement Sony can do is make LDAC more usable. As of right now it's only Android devices or licensed vendors that can transmit in this format. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops like VMing linux or buying a DAC transmitter just to use an audio codec on a device I paid for!Anyways, the AAC is more than sufficient for everyday listening (LDAC is pretty unstable, anyways, depending on the signals in your area) and it sounds amazing. Neutral, crisp, detailed.One more thing: no perceptible audio lag, whether on SBC or AAC when watching video, unlike with the Bose models. On Bose if you have to use SBC or AAC on a non Apple device, videos are nearly unwatchable. These work perfectly with both my PC running Win10 and my LGC1 OLED WebOs for watching video on the SBC codec. My Bose produces all always seem to have a perceptible lag.Get these if you're in the market for buds; I usually have a little buyer's remorse after getting premium equipment, but not with these. The NC, comfort, and audio quality all exceed what I expected from CDN400 earphones.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],6,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,3232,825,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 289.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
4,Great but...,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R1XJXQPN841UUB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,38 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on January 22, 2023",2023-01-22,Canada,,"I bought these based on reviews from several prominent mags and websites. I needed a new pair of buds and intended to get the Sennheiser Momentum 3s, but the sales for them at the time had ended, and the Sonys were still on for $250 CA. To set the stage, I’ve been an audio enthusiast for almost 40 years now. I’ve had systems from Linn, Martin Logan, Sonic Frontiers, Bryston, Mission, Cyrus, Ariston, Roksan, Musical Fidelity, bla bla, etc. I’ve had headphones Grado, B&W, Sennheiser (HD 650s) and others. Hence to say that this isn’t my first audio rodeo. So… These buds sound OK (LDAC codec in use). Sometimes they sound great. Sometimes I struggle to find something good about them. My source is usually Tidal Masters or FLAC hi-res. Bass sometimes sounds taut but it rarely goes deep. Mid range shines. Upper frequencies are often dull. You need to get the EQ going to fix the issues that they shouldn’t have to begin with. This is always an audiophile bad sign. Having said that, my main issue, though, is that they simply don’t go loud enough. This is a common complaint online. If you want to listen at conversational levels, you’ll be fine. If you want to crank Metallica, you will not. So, I bought a pair of Momentum 3s on sale recently from another retailer. The Sennheiser’s both sound much better and go much louder (aptX). The Momentums, fed a proper source, are great headphones. I’m not going to go through all of the audiophile tropes but trust me when I say the Sennheisers sound like real audiophile headphones for a remarkable price. I’ve got cables that are more expensive than these buds. The Sonys have some very cool aspects though. I’d say the noise cancelling is slightly better than the Senns and they are smarter to use. They will automatically offer to pair across multiple devices that you own as soon as you pair them once to any device. They will read your email and texts to you with a press of a button. The Sennheisers have yet to do either. Having said that, if you are an audiophile, get the Sennheisers and don’t look back. This makes me distrust the mags and websites that ever recommended these over the Senns based on sound.

Sound quality is the best I've ever had. I've used many different types of headphones/earbuds but never in this price range and the difference is definitive. I find myself hearing nuances to music I've listened to thousands of times that I've never heard before. Makes old song enjoyable to listen to all over again. I find myself queuing music I haven't listened to in years just to hear the difference and re-experience the joy they brought me all over again. Bluetooth connection depends all upon the device you are using. With my Samsung note 10 plus it never falters and sounds great but I have two different adapters for a pc, one works great and was worth $50 another is patchy and causing intermittent distortion which was worth $20. I also found that the closer you can put the adapter to your earbuds without interference from a desk or wall, the better the connection, so investing in a usb extension from the pc to the adapter so it could sit beside my keyboard was the best thing I ever did.

3,Update - battery problems. Premium earbuds - except the cheap case,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R1SUWSDVDCD1DV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on November 17, 2021",2021-11-17,Canada,,"Update Dec 2022 - there is a known issue with the batteries in these earbuds (just Google it). Although Sony seems to be cooperating with most users to exchange all the defective units...buyer beware as not everyone has been fortunate. Essentially what ends up happening is eventually one of the earbuds' battery will deplete so rapidly ending up with at least a 40% difference between the left and right buds. When this happens, expect 30 mins of playtime max. I would not recommend these until Sony has sorted this out. Apparently there is a firmware update but it still has not rolled out in Canada as of 12/19/22.===Start off with the important bits. These earbuds sound fantastic. I have been on the fence about spending a lot of money on them but after going through several others and always feeling like something was missing I kept coming back to these until I finally picked up a pair.The battery is definitely above average. I get about 7 hours with ANC on. Be warned though, using LDAC, google assistant and ANC will kill your battery. Testing with those settings brought me down to 2.5 hours. Seeing as I am listening to AAC compressed music, I decided to use AAC on the buds and the sound is great. One thing that I don't like is the bud batteries do not wear down evenly. Right seems to use more power than the left. After browsing online it seems this is common in all the units and not defective.They are comfortable but may be a little big if you have smaller ears. I tried to like the foam tips that come with it. I didn't like them so switched to some generic silicone ones I had and they fit perfect now. Why Sony doesn't also include silicone tips the way they did with the last generation (the WF-1000XM3) is beyond me. Honestly they can't cost more than $2 to include and for this price of these, they should come with a lot of tip options.Thankfully the app lets you customize the EQ because many audiophiles will not like the default sound out of the box. Once you balance it out, it sounds fantastic.ANC is good for TWS earbuds. Not as good as the headphone version of these (WH) but way better than any other buds I have tried.My biggest gripe with these is the case. For the price you would expect a premium case. Instead Sony ships a cheap case you'd expect to get with $30 buds instead. It feels cheap and you really notice how Sony cut costs when you open them and the hinge actually wobbles like it could come off at any moment. I cannot believe Sony put such premium buds into such a sub-premium case.To compare, my Jabra Elite 3 buds case feels more premium and they are 25% the price of these.Overall I am happy with these but no 5 star rating mainly due to the cheap case that I am sure is going to break shortly after the warranty expires.PROS:- Great sound once you play with the EQ- Great battery life as long as you stay away from LDAC and other options to enhance the sound- Comfortable even after wearing for 5 hours straight (my ears are not small though)- Great app for customizing but Sony should look into making it a little more user friendlyCONS:- uneven battery wear. The right bud wears down faster than left leaving you with about 15-20% difference when the right one dies-CHEAP case - belongs on a no name dollar store brand, not Sony's premium. It's honestly shocking that Sony allowed this case to be used for the WF1000XM4s.

And these earbuds aren’t much better, I was very impressed with the battery life and the ear tips which are nice but after about a month I’ve learned they come out very easily with the tip staying in your ear. Many times when I pull the earbuds out the tip stays in which is beyond annoying sometimes. The noise cancelling is average, I don’t understand everyone’s love for it, before these I had a pair of Jabra earbuds and they were on par with the Sony earbuds only paying a third of the price. The adaptive sound controls are nice at times but I honestly think these earbuds are over engineered, many times when I take an ear bud out of my ear and put it back in, it Desyncs the audio and there is a constant pause. It sounds like the earbuds are trying to get in sync again but just can’t, only way I’ve found to fix this is putting them back in and taking them out. This happens atleast once a day. I have to say, I like the earbuds but they aren’t very loud, the noise cancelling is alright at best, and the technical issues I’ve faced have not at all been representative of the nearly 500 dollars I paid for them.

5,Don't be afraid to replace the ear tips,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R24OY9WBZ6GRY5?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,39 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on November 21, 2021",2021-11-21,Canada,,"It is a bit of a story but I hope this helps others if they also experience problems with the OEM memory foam ear tips.First impressions were bad.  So bad that I was right away thinking they need to be returned because I found them unwearable.  I could not get a comfortable fit with the foam ear tips that came with it.  After messing with them for a while I used the Sony headphone app to test all 3 ear tip sizes and it told me which size was best for each ear.  So I then used the app to adjust, test, adjust, test until I got a proper seal according to the app.  Every time I put them on I had to do at least 3 adjust until the app said I had a proper seal.  But it never felt right ... I heard too much outside noise even with ANC on ... and bass was missing --- both are indications of a poor seal.  But it was the best seal I could get with the best fitting tip, and they hurt my ears.They hurt my skin where the foam pressed and they never seemed to seal quite right.  I didn't look forward to using them, and I had to take them out after only about half an hour.  So at this point I was sure I would be returning them.But I had a 10 year old Sony DR-BT160AS wireless headphone so I took the very old and dated tips off them and put them on these XM4 and wow!  They were noticeably sealed properly and comfortable!  I used the app and they were sealed properly according to the app each time I put them on without any messing around.  The bass is noticeably the way the content should be.  And the noise isolation was very good even with the ANC off, and of course much better with the ANC on.I am now quite happy with them.  They are comfortable and sound quite good.  I can wear them as long as any other comfortable fitting ear buds now that I have gotten rid of those foam things.I plan to find some silicone tips that are perhaps more modern with better sound capability, but really, they sound quite good with these 10 - 15 year old silicone tips, and the sound isolation is pretty good.So my suggestion is this:If you find them uncomfortable, or not really blocking outside noise even though the app says they are sealed, then I would strongly suggest trying silicone tips - preferably from another set of ear buds that you know fit right.My other advice is you will need to mess with the sound equalizer and bass.  They sound quite unimpressive and dull in the default settings.  So take the time to adjust the sound to match your preferences.  Mine perked up nicely when I added a little ""clear bass"" to +3 and added some a small boost to 400 and 1k hz.OK, now about the XM4 ear buds:- They are extremely accurate so you will hear EVERYTHING in a song.  So if you have poor quality MP3 then you will hear that.  Years ago I recorded some old albums to MP3 and they were pretty good but vinyl has some pops and snaps, and they sure do stand out on the MX4.- As you probably read, you can control pause & next song & previous song --- OR --- volume up & volume down.  NOT BOTH.  Disappointing, and I think an error by Sony to not allow both controls at the same time.  My work around is that I have it set to pause & next song & previous song, and I use google assistant to control volume ... and the ear buds hear ""hey google"" almost every time, so it really is not a problem for me.  So now if I want more volume, then I say ""hey google"" and then ""turn volume up"" and it works good, but I still a work around on a bad decision by Sony.- I find ""speak to chat"" an interesting idea but it is not great.  I prefer to pause and turn on ambient sound to chat, and that way it doesn't constantly cut in and out.  Interesting concept but I think it needs more work to be practical.  The ambient sound turned to highest setting does allow you to talk.- DSEE Extreme (fix losses due to compressing music) seems to work decent but I do find it tires me a bit, so I am leaving it off for now.  Mostly it seems to add too much edge or sharpness.  But I am still getting used to these new earbuds, so later I intend to play with it a little more.Overall, I am very pleased with how they sound.  And that, above all else, is the most important thing.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],1,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,15511,2351,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 289.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds
5,Honest Detailed Review from an Audio/Musico-phile from Canada,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q1ZECU53LS8O?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,408 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on July 17, 2021",2021-07-17,Canada,,"I won't faff about and get straight to the point. That's what you're here for:• Packaging - Minimalist and environmentally friendly packaging. Everything is well put together and secure inside a very sturdy box made of recycled materials. Inside the box you have the charging case with the earphones, manuals, USB-C cable and two extra sets of ear tips (small and large. medium is on the earphones).• Setup - I have used previous iterations of the WF and WH series, so I had the app already installed on my phone. I put the earphones on and opened the app and it connected INSTANTLY on Android. The case and earphones are not fully charged, so make sure to charge them first. Once you're all connected, there will be an update downloaded which took me about an hour.• App - I won't say too much and let you explore it yourself. Through the app you will be able to customize the equalizer, sound quality, noise cancelling, touch functions, speak to chat, and see a bunch other features like testing fit and seal. It's a robust app that's easy to navigate and has never failed me.• Fit - This is subjective but I have a few tips that might help you. Take the tips and place them in your ear. Don't worry, they won't get stuck or fall in. The one that you feel fits best is the one you should go with. The better the fit and seal the better the noise cancelling and bass will be. You can also test how good the fit and seal is through the app. Attach the preferred tips to the earphones and lead the speaker into your ear canal. You should feel it going into your ear canal. Next, twist it in an anti-clockwise direction to lock it in place. That's it! Shake your head to confirm that it's in place.• Feel - The earphones themselves are very light with a beautiful smooth matte finish. Same goes for the case, which is also ridiculously compact. It's all high quality finishes and once they're in the ear, you won't really notice them. They also look very appealing and stylish. The ear tips are made of a soft malleable material. Imagine squishing a small marshmallow in between your fingers and you'll get an idea of the texture and feel. A small gripe is that you might feel a little benign irritation over long periods of wearing them. This went away once I changed my tips from small to medium, so try that first.• Sound Quality - This is what you're really here for, and these earphones do not disappoint. I listen to everything from traditional classical to the heaviest of metal and all sorts of avant-garde stuff. I have a few staple albums that I use to test any new set of earphones/headphones because they're immaculately recorded with tons of tiny details. They also run the gamut of popular genres and should give anyone a good idea of what to expect:1) The Prodigy - The Fat of the Land: The bass on these earphones is superb. It's not overbearing or gimmicky. It's balanced and complements the listening experience. It's on full display on songs like Diesel Power and Smack My B**** Up where it really shines without losing any details. Elsewhere, the acid tinged synthesizers really buzz. You can almost tell exactly when Liam is hitting the keys as they reverberate and sustain in your head. It feels like you're in the room listening  as he composes the song.2) Tool - Fear Inoculum: This is an album with a lot of layers and intricate musicianship. Adam Jones's guitar comes alive in your head as you close your eyes and imagine him plucking the guitar strings. It really is that detailed. It's like you're sitting in a concert hall watching the band perform for you. Where the earphones really shine is how well they bring out the intricate details of Danny Carey's drumming. I could hear all sorts of faint cymbals and drums in the background and it just brought a smile across my face. If you like rock/metal music then these earphones won't disappoint.3) Hans Zimmer - Blue Planet 2: Hans Zimmer is so prolific and talented that he is constantly finding ways to add new elements to his music. Violins, oboes, trumpets, pianos are all faithfully realized through the earphones, especially on tacks like Albatross Flight. It's so stunning, detailed and clear that it will ignite your imagination. It's honestly better than actually going to the orchestra.• Connection/Battery - No issues with any dropped Bluetooth connection. I keep noise cancelling and LDAC sound quality on all the time and I get a comfortable 6-8 hours out of one charge. If you use DSEE (only if you have low quality music), then expect half that range. I also didn't experience any bugs or glitches related to the earphones or software.• Noise Cancelling - I've had at least 3 other headphones and earphones from the WH and WF range. The noise cancelling on these earphones is slightly behind it's over the head cousins. But only slightly. I've had them on with no music and had my partner talk to me (standing directly in front of me) and I heard nothing. You will be perfectly fine walking on the streets and won't hear anything, unless a big truck goes right by you. I also tested them while using an electric toothbrush, and I really only heard the vibrations of the motor in my head. Overall, top class industry leading stuff here that leaves rivals in the dust.There you have it. These earphones really impressed me. For me, a new pair of earphones or headphones should make me fall in love with my music collection again. It should bring a smile to my face when I hear details I didn't before. These do exactly that. Yes they are expensive, but they also offer a lot in terms of specs and features. If you want the best, then these are it. I actually sold my Sony headphones because we finally have nearly 20 hours of battery life in a super compact and portable package without any loss of sound quality. That alone is worth the price for me.Best sound setting recommendations:• Noise cancelling on• Bright equalizer preset• Customize the preset with 2 or 3 points of clear bass• Switch to focus on quality over connection• Switch to LDAC codec on Android.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],2,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,15511,2351,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 289.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds

I have used expensive over-ear headphones that don't even come close to the noise cancellation these pair of earphones offer (mainly compared with the Momentum 3 wireless).I truly can't hear ANYTHING when commuting with low-volume music playing. The transparency mode is good, but nothing contests the Airpods pro transparency mode for me. Still great transparency though, I am just a little spoilt. Most things about the build quality also feel good. The hinge on the case is a little squeaky and not that tight feeling, but the earbuds and the rest of the case feel amazing. Nice matte finish, and quality. The case is definitely chunkier than the Airpods pro case but it doesn't bother me. The XM3 case did definitely bother me. The sound quality is great, really clean sounding with a nice bass. Paired with the noise cancellation it is truly next level. Really nice sounding. Much cleaner and balanced than the Pros and the 1000xm3. The controls are good, but since using the pros, I have never preferred touch controls. The pressure sensor on the pros are just unbelievably good. The controls are top-tier compared to other touch sensor buds, though. I've used the galaxy buds Pro as well as the 1000XM3s but these are by far the most responsive and quick. Comfort is great too, they fit in my ear really well and almost never fall off. The pros fit in my ear unbelievably well but these still fit in my ear great and don't get close to falling out. The XM3s never fit well in my ear and would fall out often. The battery life on these is AMAZING, 8 hours of ANC is truly a luxury. I remember, I woke up, put on the buds, and ate lunch, went to the gym, worked out, went to the library, studied, and went back home, and still had 30% remaining battery. I never took off the buds once. This is truly the biggest difference between the pros and these buds. The battery life is so noticeable and amazingOverall, Sony nailed this. They have everything.

The sound quality is exceptional, however there are a couple of annoying things.But first, the fit in the ear is exceptional. You will have to give your head a hard shake for them to come loose. The overall sound quality is fabulous for something so small. Controls are easy to use.The noise cancelling feature is not as effective as I hoped. The Sony WH 1000 XM4 over the ear phones are far more effective at noise cancellation. My old Bose corded noise cancelling earbuds are more effective. However the Sony produces richer sound than the Bose.The sound quality is not as good as Sony WH 1000 XM4 over the ear phones.The other annoying feature that is shared with the Sony over the ear phones. They often drop the volume with a beep for a second or two like they are adjusting for an outside sound, perhaps trying to compensate for intruding sounds. The blip in volume is quite noticeable and seems to happen regularly, especially when wearing these in a noisy environment.Maybe I am nitpicking, but for the price I expected a little better.If size is important then these are a great choice, if you are comfortable with much larger over the ear phones, then the Sony WH1000XM4 is a better choice.One month later…The more I use these earbuds, the more I dislike them. I am convinced there is NO difference between ambient sound and noise cancelling mode. Regardless of mode I can hear quite a bit of background noise. The constant beeping and volume drop is exceedingly annoying. I do not know why it does this. It seemingly happens for no apparent reason and occurs regularly regardless of background noise or silence. Even though the sound is good and the fit it good, I keep going back I my corded Bose noise cancelling earbuds as they perform so much better. The noise cancelling function with the Bose is far superior.  I realize this not comparing apples to apples. I wish I could try the Bose cordless noise cancelling earbuds to compare to the Sony to give a fairer comparison, but they too are expensive items.

5,Another Winner from Sony!,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R2AYNV5DFXVW1J?ASIN=B094C4VDJZ,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on November 27, 2021",2021-11-27,Canada,,"I've been an owner of all the Sony noise cancellation Headphones and earbuds and have always been a fan. One thing about Sony's headphones is that they are definitely immersive than any other headphones as you can feel the bass and even the thumping of the guitar within your head as though you were sitting beside the artist whispering soft music directly into your head. No other headphones gives you this immersive experience especially when you compare Apples to oranges. The new WF-1000XM4 case is half the size of the WF-1000XM3 and I guess Sony had been listening since I complained about having to wear oversize pants just to carry their headphones around. The half size case is a delight and it almost feels like a set of AirPods. The new circular type headphones takes some time to get use to as Sony now uses foam tips and to wear foam tips you have to squeeze the tips and quickly insert and twist the tips into your ears. You cannot simply squish the earphones into your ears like you would with the rubber tips. Also there is a high pitch annoying squealing of the headphones as you insert into your ears; no idea probably holding or covering the mics as I insert. I need to form new muscle memory to insert the new headphones. Although the app has adaptive sound control I have never used it mainly because it uses location services which basically turns on GPS which drains your phone. Also I am not a fan of the 360 Reality Audio which is basically an attempt of cloning the features of spatial audio from Apple. Just feed music directly into my brain and I'm happy. 360 Reality Audio just basically puts you into a room with music which isn't really that immersive. I love the new foam tips as they almost seal and cements the headphones into your ear making the headphones as one with your brain and no shaking of your head will dislodge them. I think that with each evolution of Sony's headphones they get better and better and I love my WF-1000XM4 more than the XM3. If you are on the fence about buying the XM4, do jump over.

They used to make it around 7 hours of non-stop battery life but at 1.5 years old, I am only getting about 3 hours from a full charge. So even though I love them, I was hoping for something with a more durable battery, These Sony WF-1000XM4 are advertised as running 8 hours with NC on and a lot of comments claim these are easily the best sounding and NC wireless earbuds they have tried so I wanted to try them.I was really disappointed, there is nothing on them that justifies the price being 3x's as much. Here is what I found:After some tweaking of the EQ I really liked the sound better at low and even mid volumes. But at mid-higher volumes I didn't hear a big sound quality difference, albeit I don't hear as well at my age so my opinion here is possibly skewed. Both seemed to go about the same max volume.I love they would pause the music and turn on ambient mode if I started talking. I also found they stayed in my ears better than my current earbuds but I did notice more soreness after wearing for any length of time. I always wear both earbuds, so although I didn't experience this, I saw some complaints that some features do not work if you are only wearing one earbud so be aware of that if you like to wear one at a time.The noise cancelling is huge disappointment as they paled in comparison. I found the Sony pair did a better job of blocking out voices, but it was horrible in comparison at removing constant noises like fans, vehicle noise, snoring, etc. which is more important to me. The Sony earbuds also do not amplify voices in ambient mode but do amplify wind. The fact it turns on ambient mode (if enabled) when talking, you think it would focus on boosting voices, not traffic/wind noise. My old Soundcore earbuds definitely win in this category.I love that they pause playback when you remove them and they will turn off if you take them out and not put them in the case. However, normally when I take earbuds out, I put them in the case or I know I'll lose them so it is neat feature with very little real benefit.The big deal breaker was battery life. Sony claims these earbuds can go 8 hours with NC turned on. Reviewers were claiming more around 6 hours but that is good for me. So this was the primary reason I purchased them. When they arrived, the earbuds are much larger and heavier so I expected this was quality/battery life. However, from a full charge, the right earbud went dead in just 3 hours even though the left earbud was still at 50%. This repeated after doing another full charge and trying again. Normally, I'd assume this is a defective product and that also means the sound quality, NC, etc could all be off from what I should be experiencing. However, after a google search I found lots of other users having this issue with these Sony earbuds. The red flag is some reviewers had them replaced by warranty only to have the exact same problem with the new earbuds. This issue has been going on for a couple years and I've seen complaints as recent as a few weeks ago. This suggests it is pointless to go through the hassles of warranty claims or even getting a replacement.So I'm hugely disappointed. Buying these on sale for $250, they were more than 3x's expensive than my Life P3 headphones (currently on sale for $80). Considering the sound quality is only noticeably better to me at low volumes, the NC and ambient modes are not nearly as good, the battery life is much less than advertised, and the faulty hardware is an ongoing issue that has been unresolved for at least 2 years, I can't justify keeping these. I've initiated a product return with Amazon and will stick with Soundcore.",True,Colour Name: Silver,[],1,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,1974,1248,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 289.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds

In other words, your audio quality on video games and phone calls is awful. You will NEVER hear footsteps in games like COD or Fortnite if the mic is on.

However, I have no choice but to return these, Sony has disappointed me this time.I still give five stars for noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life. Indeed, these are good, the ANC works better than all Bose sets I have ever tried without significant pressure on my ears, one slight downside is they aren’t as comfortable as the Bose.Their sound signature is almost the same as the classic XBA-Z5, which I happen to love and own two pairs of. XM4s sound warm and reasonably clear, the soundstage is narrower than Z5, which is not unexpected. After all, they are Bluetooth, single-driver and only sold for half of the price. Adjusting the EQ (7 5 0 7 10 cb+10) helps a lot, but don’t expect a game-changer.The batteries (both the pods and the case) charge reasonably fast and hold longer than advertised. The bamboo-based case is good for the environment.Regardless of the good things, there is one irredeemable flaw you MUST know before buying these, it simply isn’t talked about enough.I bought these mainly for video conferencing. I noticed the left pod makes a metallic echo when I talk, clank my teeth, or even when someone else is talking, as long as ANC is on. This seems to be a common problem (just google “WF1000XM4 metallic”) and cannot be solved by exchanging, so I eventually decided it’s better to simply get WH1000XM5 instead. Sony’s costumer service is friendly but they have no idea what’s going on, don’t waste your time with them.Intriguingly, the same model sold on the Chinese market does not have this issue, I suspect it’s because they don’t come with voice assistant?Think twice before you buy these, they are not exactly cheap. If you can accept the flaw then it can become a good deal after WF1000XM5 comes out, check the current price for XM3 as a reference. For me though, when I pay more than $200 I expect some kind of reliable quality, so that’s a return, hopefully Sony can get its stuff together.",True,Colour Name: Black,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FSEaYX2cL._SY88.jpg'],5,B094C4VDJZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B094C4VDJZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B094C4VDJZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,1974,1248,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 289.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",sony xm4 earbuds

I've had the original samsung buds for a few years and they have been pretty good. Decent enough sound, have survived lots of bike rides in the rain and trips to the gym. I also have the sony wh xm4 headphones which are fantastic noise quality and the anc is great too. I wanted to upgrade my buds by getting some with more up to date sound quality and anc for use in the gym. The wh xm4s are a bit big for gym use and the original buds aren't noise cancelling.

I also have a samsung galaxy s22 plus mobile and only use headphone with my phone. I was hoping they would be an up to date version of my original buds.First impressions were good. The base was good, punchy and the anc was great. I noticed they didn't fit in my ear as securely as the original buds but they didn't feel like they'd fall out. After trying a few songs with them.I noticed that the higher notes of songs such as snares and 's' in vocals were quite sharp and tinny making the listening experience uncomfortable. The overall sound of the buds also wasn't as warm as the sonys I have. The eq options on the samsung app are limited but I did try some 3rd party apps to see if I could get the buds to sound better by lessening the harshness of the treble, but I couldn't and the sound of them was ruining songs that I really liked listening to with my original buds or sonys. It really is a shame and I'm not sure what is causing this issue. There are quite a few other people having the same issues in forums online. I'm returning them and will go back to the drawing board.

4,A Worthy Upgrade from Buds+,,,"Reviewed in Australia on October 25, 2023",2023-10-25,Australia,,"I was a (relatively) happy user of Galaxy Buds+ until I lost them about a week ago and bought a set of Buds2 Pro as a replacemet. This review will focus on major differences between Buds+ and Buds2 Pro.Sound quality: compared to Buds+, Buds2 Pro's sound quality is significantly improved. Bass receives the biggest improvement, making the low end punchy without distortion at higher volume. Mids and highs are slightly improved, producing crisp sound and good separation between instruments and vocals. The soundstage is also much better in the Buds2 Pro, improving immersion.  Buds2 Pro offers 360 degree head tracking but this is mainly a gimmick in my opinion, and not a feature worth upgrading for alone.Volume: Buds2 Pro max volume is significantly louder than Buds+. I had use an app to increase maximum volume on my Buds+.  Buds2 Pro's max volume is uncomfortably loud and unless you suffer from hearing loss, you won't be disappointed with this aspect. I'm not sure if the volume increase is due to active noise cancellation or tighter fit but it's there all the same.ANC / Ambient Sound: speaking of active noise cancellation, Buds2 Pro's implementation is excellent and a reason alone to upgrade from Buds+ which lacked this feature.  Noise cancellation blocks out all but the loudest ambient noise and really separates you from the outside world.  It's great for concentrating in a noisy environment like an office and I imagine it would be excellent during flights.  Buds2 Pro also has an ambient sound mode which pipes in external sound using an array of microphones. This generally works well but louder sounds and excessive wind can overwhelm the microphones and create high pitched distortion which is not pleasant. There's an option to detect speech automatically and lower the volume so you can have a conversation without pausing or removing the buds. I quickly turned this off because it was sensitive and consantly cut in when I didn't want it to.Size and comfort: this is another area where Buds2 Pro received a significant upgrade. Compared to Buds+, Buds2 Pro are lighter, smaller and more comfortable. The Buds2 Pro fit snugly and form a tight seal in the ear, which improves sound quality and noise cancellation. I find the Buds2 Pro are much less likely to fall out during movement than Buds+ which were annoyingly loose no matter the combination of wingtips and eartips. This does depend on individual fit so your mileage may vary.Battery life: while the actual buds have similar battery life, the Buds2 Pro's case battery has more capacity and can quick charge one hour in five minutes. This is a great feature if you need a quick top-up before a workout or phone call.Overall: the Buds2 Pro are a worthy upgreade from Buds+ in most areas. In particular, the sound quality, noise cancellation, volume, fit and charging are significantly improved in Buds2 Pro. I bought these on sale for $220 AUD which is a good price for what you get. At the recommended price of $320 AUD, they are a harder sell as this is similar price point to excellent alternatives from Sony, Apple and ""audiophile"" brands.",True,,[],4,B0B8TC6KWF,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B8TC6KWF?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B8TC6KWF&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,402,90,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 160.8, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Galaxy Buds2 Pro
4,"Such great sound, painful design for smaller ears",,32 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2023",2023-09-15,United States,,"This earbuds are absolutely incredible for the cost differential; pay a bit more, massive upgrade in sound quality.I have nice speakers and decent wired over-ears at home, but with my partner and I both working hybrid schedules, I usually listen to music and podcasts with my earbuds in. I always told myself I'd just use my speakers, but being able to have just one bud in so I'm not walking around the house like an oblivious wad is irresistible. The wireless convenience calls to me. However, I've never been so much of a noise geek that I was going to pay for nicer wireless earbuds. Still, the reality of the situation is that I use earbuds an overwhelming amount of the time.Because of this, it crept up slowly that I've hardly been listening to music. I had the older, non-pro Galaxy buds 2 for years- replaced once with the same model to have spares without an upgrade- and while I loved the look and feel of them and they were serviceable, the sound was not great. Audio for calls was sometimes terrible, and I was unintelligible half the time. They fell out of my ears if I was running, although not so abruptly I couldn't fix the positioning and prevent them from popping out with a free hnad. Ultimately, none of these issues were enough to make me want to upgrade to the bulkier, more expensive Pro earbuds. Still, when my older headphones started to get finicky again, I eventually bit the bullet, thinking I might just get more of the non-Pros anyway.It was amazing. These are the first earbuds I've owned where the sound quality was worth even listening to music on, and that's when I realized immediately how much more I'd be listening to. They have great, rich, dynamic sound. I didn't love the look of the exterior speaker on the larger buds, but I 180'd as soon as I heard the results- obviously, it was worth it.They were so much bigger that they looked a little goofy in my ears. Not a big deal, worth the effect and good noise that came out of them. I've been very excited.Unfortunately, I like having background noise running for much of my workday, and my partner and I often have different listening priorities. This is a problem because I quickly realized that, if worn for an extended period of time, these are physically painful on the cartilage of my ears. No matter how I positioned them, if I wore them for a few hours, my ears (specifically, whatever you call the curve of cartilage above the lobe) get sore to the touch for hours or days. Seemingly, I can get about an hour of listening out of these a day. That's a downer, as I didn't buy them thinking I'd have to restrict my use of them as aggressively as my parents tried to limit my screen time in the early 2000s.On the plus side, they still sound great, and my old headphones ended their time on the fritz, so I've just gone back to them. I can wear these around the house where my options are ample, and in theory, I'll probably still use them. I'm holding out secret hope that I can slowly damage the cartilage of my ears enough that I can wear them longer, but for now, I'm punished with seriously tender ear-tissue that lasts for days and bothers me even if I switch headphones or earbuds.Long and short of it, they sound great. They're massively worth the money if you're considering an upgrade from the regular galaxy 2's for the pro's (although I still prefer the smaller, simpler look aesthetically). They even stopped falling out of my ears when I'm on a run with this new design. Unfortunately, be cautious if your ear-holes aren't on the larger side and you aren't willing to gauge a weird part of your ears as part of the bargain.",True,,[],5,B0B8TC6KWF,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B8TC6KWF?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B8TC6KWF&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,402,90,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 160.8, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Galaxy Buds2 Pro

4,Will not pair with Galaxy Note 9,,One person found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023",2023-11-22,United States,,"Just a warning, these buds will not pair with a Galaxy Note 9.  The phone sees a serial number (not the name of the product) and fails to pair.The buds will pair with a Galaxy 6 classic watch, but since neither the buds nor the watch come with documentation, it took some sleuthing to find a solution that worked.  As so:The buds go into pairing mode when the case is opened.  Best practices is to leave the case on a charger for an hour or so before first trying to pair.From the watch, go to setup -> connections -> bluetooth.  Turn on bluetooth if not on.Open the case for the earbuds.  This starts the pairing process.When the buds name come up in the watch display, touch it.  You should be paired at that point.Save yourself some trouble and put the Galaxy Buds Pro app in the Tiles screen so you can find it easily.Go to the Galaxy Buds Pro app.Note that you need to have the buds firmly seated in your ears for the noise cancellation to work.  Like, really firmly.You'll notice when the buds are seated firmly enough because the ""noise cancellation"" button will no longer be greyed out and the sound quality improves dramatically.One final note:  These buds are only as good as the source.  If the music source is highly compressed, the buds will sound tinny.  With a good music source and with the buds seated properly they seem decent.There doesn't seem to be any kind of mixer app on the watch, so you can't do things like bring up the bass or fix the treble.  I'd love to be wrong on this but I have not found any way to change the mixture.  A lot of the music on the Amazon Music app sounds tinny as a result.

4,I like these but...,,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023",2023-12-29,United States,,"...for some reason, even with the same size rubber tips, this pair does not fit as well as my Buds+. I like the noise cancelling and the idea of being able to listen to music and have them automatically mute (or turn down the volume of the music - I forget) is pretty cool in the right situation (Voice Detect). I like the base response and the different EQ presets. The ambient sound functionality also works very well. 360 Audio is a pretty cool feature too. Yeah its gimmicky but a cool gimmick!Double/Triple-tap works well. Reading my text messages to me is GREAT!As you can tell, because I don't remember exactly what that feature does, it isn't useful for my needs. I guess if you are walking around Walmart by yourself shopping it would work perfectly. 95% of the time you are doing your own thing in silence but when you need to ask where something is located it would switch back-and-forth appropriately.

4,Buds are great but cord has 2 type C ends,,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2023",2023-10-21,United States,,"I've had these Galaxy ear buds just a short time & haven't used all the features yet so can't review those.  The ear buds themselves are super -- they connect to my Samsung phone easily & have good range & sound.  However -- when they arrived, the cord that  came with them had C-type connectors on both ends & no USB end. I navigated through the painful help screens to report the issue -- none of the supplied click options apply, so I needed to find someplace to just type in my wish to get a regular type C USB cord rather than the double ended  cord that I found unusable.  Finally found a chat screen & the helpful fellow said he would just send me a whole new box - buds, extra rubber ear things, and cord.  Well.  When the new box came, that cord had 2 C ends too.  I was told that I could use it with 'any brick type Samsung charger.'  I was uninformed - didn't know what that was - so after researching I learned that it's just a regular wall plug in like the ones for USB cords, but with a type C port instead.  i could get one for $20 or $25 - or more if so inclined.  A whole new charger that  had only one purpose  -- to charge my Samsung ear buds?  Rather than using any of maybe a dozen regular USB chargers that I already have?  Does not make sense to me.  So I went to Walmart & bought an extra $5.98 USB cord.

How they can have connection issues and fall apart. But like others have said, these are one of the best sound earbuds probably to come out, and note best sounding. They won't have the best noise cancelling or transparency mode. I think Samsung, Google or Apple earbuds still take cakes for those segments due to their excellence in software but Sennheiser didn't slouch still. They can block out noise decently and still offer great transparency. I will say, transparency mode gives off this white noise sound, which may turn some people, but I can bear it for a couple minutes. You can lessen this white noise effect if you turn transparency mode to a low setting in the Sennheiser app. Speaking of the app, I find it very great. The personal EQ was very fancy and made my sound setting much better. I like that we can bind our control taps for different controls. Although I wish I could change the controls for volume. I want a tap for volume and not a tap and hold but maybe a future update perhaps. I have run into some connection issues, very minor sometimes, the earbuds just start dropping, cut in and out. I just pop my earbuds in the case and out, have them reconnect. Simple fix for now. Overall, my experience with them is great overall.

2,Poor user experience for the money; ANC didn't work at all but it could be a one-off problem,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y3ERSZO7HUKL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09T8YPFV2,12 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on October 13, 2022",2022-10-13,Canada,,"Very disappointing:- Sound quality was no better than a $40 pair of wired earbuds - unacceptable at $300+;- ANC didn't work at all. I tried tapping the earbuds & tried manually turning on in phone app;- Sound equalizer in the phone app didn't appear to work, or made no discernable difference;- Battery life was 1-2 hours tops, not the 6-8 hours advertised;- Case added no battery life to top up the earbuds.These problems could be a one-off affecting only my set, but that seems unlikely: earbuds run off an integrated circuit with all software in firmware, not run from separate modules (these things are incredibly compact when you consider all the functionality baked in). So I fail to see how basic sound functionality would work if advanced features don't.This is odd: I watched a ton of YouTube reviews comparing the Sennheiser True Wireless 3 with Sony's WF1000XM4 & Bose's Quiet Comfort earbuds; read reviews & comparisons in credible hi fi audio journals, credible IT product review sites, even a few news media (The Guardian, etc). Consensus was that the Sennheiser product is comparable to Sony's, ANC as good & audio performance if anything marginally better. None of them would have rated my pair that good.I leaned towards the Sennheiser earbuds as I've had such good experience with Sennheiser's Momentum 3 ANC headphones: audio quality is exceptional & ANC is nothing short of magical (esp. on a long flight). Plus I had to call Sennheiser to report the batteries failed 2 years in - technically right at the end of the warranty period (perhaps a bit over, in fact): they replaced the headsets without a quibble. That buys loyalty.I'm going to try Sony's WF1000XM4s instead now. This pair may have had a one-off problem, but they weren't that comfortable either (that's a personal issue - you need to try & find a pair that are comfortable. What works for me might not for you).I WILL however continue to default to Sennheiser for future audio gear. Those Momentum 3s & my warranty claim experience really did make an impression. This firm stands behind its products, they're easy to reach & very easy to deal with.BTW, I add Amazon's Asurion Extended Warranty protection to any high-value audio gear purchase. It's peace of mind, and Amazon's support is accessible & easy to deal with.

I contacted Sennheiser for the warranty and it took them 2-3 months to answer me (Said they lost track of the demand) but they upgraded my warranty by sending me some True Wireless Momentum 2. Those TW2 lasted me a year, they were good with almost no issues, some small problems that weren't a deal break up. But the fact that I had two Sennheiser product break on me within such a short time had me worried about the build quality in general of the company... So I reluctantly decided to buy these TW3 cause the sound of the TW2 is amazing and it's technically an upgrade right? They will iron out the kinks and make it better?...Oh boy, was I wrong... The TW3 are 1 step forward and 2 steps back:+ Stability fins+ Sound is amazing+ Wireless charging on the case+/- Charging port is in front of the case. Not a big deal but really annoying since the TW2 one is at the back and it make sense+/- Case has no button to check the charge level. You need to open the case itself- Not sure if a defect on mine but the earbuds sometimes won't charge... Yep, that's a deal breaker for me. Might be cause it's badly seated or the connection is poor.- Anytime I change song, the sound cuts off for half a second. So I tested it out and basically, anything that get in front of the earbuds make it cutoff (finger, hand, moving my head fast, even taking off my shirt...)- The ANC is not good, especially when the TW2 one was amazing...- The ""Power On"" and ""Recharge Headset"" voice is extremely loud at times and sometime it's low. I don't understand that one and there's no way to change it in the app- The case doesn't have a button to check the battery levelI am beyond disappointed at that price range.

1,4 month Update: regret buying them.,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R1MHDFODEH2UM4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09T8YPFV2,13 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on May 21, 2023",2023-05-21,Canada,,"Update after +4 months of using them on a daily basis:(I should mention that I take good care of my buds and problems mentioned below are not a result of mishandling them)About 2 weeks ago when I was on a call, one of the earbuds started making a beeping sound. It was annoying but I thought it was a one time thing. That was just the beginning.  Over the past 2 weeks the earbuds have just gone crazy. Now they make beeping sounds every now and then (out of nowhere), sometimes for 10s sometimes just 1s. It only happens when the ANC is on, and the ANC doesn't work as well as it used to. It doesn't filter out the noise like it used to, and sometimes it actually amplifies some weird frequencies (I hear very odd things). The beeping/clicking sound from the left earbud has become a normal problem. The sound from the right earbud is sometimes muffled and outside noise is amplified instead. I can no longer listen to music with the ANC on. I have searched online forums and apparently THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE for these earbuds. Some people have fixed the issue (temporarily) by cleaning the buds, which I have done multiple times, but didn't help. Factory resetting them didn't help either. I am going to try and return these buds (probably not gonna make it) because I am fully disappointed in them. I was not expecting these issues from a +300$ pair of buds._____________Old review:Got these for my IPhone 14 pro about 2 months ago. Waited to write this review to be able to paint a true picture. Starting with:+ The positives: great music quality, will not disappoint for a pair of in-ear buds. Great build quality, the case and the buds are very sturdy, the magnets hold on to the buds for deal life and never let go, haven't had problems with the size of the earbuds so far and the fit pretty good in my ears (had to replace the one for my left ear with a larger size though). Have been wearing them during workouts, studying, working etc,. I am pleased with the noise cancelling, It's not perfect but is does what it's supposed to. Touch controls are sensitive enough and over all my experience with these buds have been really good. There is are some drawbacks though that I should mention. Before that, I should mention I have updated these buds/all my devices to the latest version.- The negative:Based on my experience with these pair of earbuds, with an IPhone 14 pro, a gaming laptop (Windows 11) and a Linux (Ubuntu 22), there are some connection issues. Throughout the last ~60 days, there have been more than 10 times when I had to take the buds out and put in my ear, hear ''connected"" and play audio just to realize it's not playing. Putting the buds back into their case and redoing the process has worked every time. They have multi-point connectivity, meaning you can connect to 2 devices at the same time. But my experience with this has been far from seamless. Sometimes I'm listening to sth on my phone, and the music suddenly stops for no reason. And more importantly, any signal from the pc overrides the current stream from the phone, meaning the music stops if I get an email notification on my pc. Muting the pc doesn't help either. There have been more than 10 times where I had to put the buds back in their case and take them out just to connect to to 2 devices because it didn't connect to the 2nd device. Now I only connect to both devices if most of my work is on the pc.One last issue with these is that, whenever I send a voice/video message, I hear ""call ended"" at the end of it. This is quite bothersome for me because I tend to send lots of voice messages, but I have to hear the lady say ""call ended"" at the end of any kind of voice recording.",True,Colour Name: Graphite,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610skrKWvaL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61K2QnJCXwL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WnXH4N+DL._SY88.jpg']",2,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,527,429,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 249.95, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3

Those beats were able to switch from my laptop to my phone immediately when I pick up my phone to scroll on Instagram, and switch back to my laptop when I resume video watching on my laptop. Maybe a little extra, but I thought it was quite useful, so when I was looking at earbuds in this price range, I found SENNHEISER Momentum TW 3, the only one that supports Bluetooth multipoint connectivity. At first listen, the sound quality was great. I like hip-hop more, so I immediately noticed the bass enhance. However, I also enjoy EDM occasionally, and one of the songs I listened to, I think the treble squeaked a little bit, but could just be the song. ANC is good, but not as good as AirPods Pro? When I had AirPods Pro in, i could not hear the person standing right next to me, even without music. However, with Sennheiser, I find that without music or sound playing, a little bit of background noise still comes thru and if somebody is talking right next to me, I can hear it. Good for conversations, bad for studying. Transparency mode was good, although I think there was a bit white noise in the background, not sure if that is just surroundings or the earbuds. Controls are sensitive, since they are touch to control. I don’t like them, because I hate having to press down on it, but it was very sensitive - if you’re trying to take them off or put them on you will trigger the controls. What really made the dealbreaker for me was the fit. For some reason, maybe because my ears are of different size, it fit my right ear comfortably and nicely, but refuse to fit my left ear. I’ve tried every wing and every tip, they just won’t fit. The design of these earbuds goes like this: the body of the earbud is supposed to fit entirely in your ear, while the tip goes in your ear canal. This brings an issue: there are cartilages in ears and everyone has different ears, so I’m not sure how they expected the body to fit the shape of of everyone’s cartilages..after an hour or so of fidgeting with the tips and wings, and an hour or so of listening, I could feel the pressure of earbud on my left ear canal and was not happyTLDR: great sound quality, ANC good but obv not top of the game (if you want top of the game, BOSE QC 2 is your best bet), fit not very comfortable for my left ear (could just be me)Update: since it’s uncomfortable in my left ear, I can’t go long without adjusting it, and every time I adjust the headphones it triggers the controls (since they are super sensitive) and it’s kinda annoying",True,Colour Name: White,[],1,B09T8YPFV2,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09T8YPFV2?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09T8YPFV2&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,231,121,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 249.95, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sennheiser MTW3

I use buds all the time at home and at work to help me focus and enjoy audiobooks and podcasts.Background white noise is present but it's very minimal and only noticeable when nothing is playing and everything is quiet.The thing that drives me crazy is how poor the setup is, which is part of their design. Buds need to be in the case with lid open to pair so keep it nearby if you switch sources often.There are persistent connectivity issues and a bud might not work until you unpair and pair the device again.

TAKE THE TIME TO FIND THE RIGHT FIT FOR YOUR EARS.- Noise Cancelling is amazing as always with Bose, particularly the AWARE mode. It controls and perfectly fluctuates the strength of the noise cancellation depending on how loud the areas are that you’re in so that you can still hear people speaking to you over all the racket in your environment. Also, if the room you’re in is quiet and something loud and abrupt we’re to happen there’s a feature that will quickly dull that sound before the whole thing travels to your ears.- These buds are super lightweight so I can wear them for hours and forget they’re in my ears while I perform tasks; this is also because I took the time to choose the RIGHT FIT FOR MY EARS. And the reason why I emphasize this is because all of the features just work best with the proper fit.CONS - They’re still fairly buggy when trying to maintain connection with the Bose Connect app and need an extra software update or two which will come. Also, sometimes if you move or something moves enough to slightly alter the orientation of the buds in your ear, the music sometimes does this thing where it sounds different for a split second, as if it’s changing in and out of a stereo mode or something. I suspect this also has something to do with not wearing the proper fit and letting them become too greasy and slippery in my ears. I now use micellar water pads to gently clean wax and oils. I have since experienced this much less and don’t notice this issue anymore.",True,"Colour Name: SoapstoneSize

No two ear canals left to right are exactly the same and this device is very unforgiving in terms of fitment.I can get it to fit by playing around with it but if I move, it moves and usually pops out somewhat, breaking the seal and you lose a lot of tonality and bass.Second issue, is the low battery life. The competitively priced Sony's have far superior battery life, just not as good in terms of audio quality, but that's subjective. I like the Bose, because of their fantastic bass, and they have a little bit more volume than the Sony's which I find lacking in some cases.In any case they're far better than the first generation, and I'm keeping these.

If this review was solely for those two things these headphones would get 5 stars.Now for the bad. 1) Hissing white noise when in Transparency Mode. I do not know why but this issue persisted even after exchanging them.2) Left bud connectivity issues all the time. I had the newest firmware updated and while the left bud can be used on it own, it constantly disconnects forcing me to put both buds back in the case and restart.3) Comfort. I personally found these not to work with my ears. I cannot find a better fitting earbud than the AirPods Pro’s. This is what I found for myself and fit will vary.I won’t even mention the terrible Bose app. Overall these few issues could be overlooked if not for the $379 sticker price.

The price is too high but the size is ok and the sound quality is good along with ok mics for phonecalls. I've had to buy aftermarket foam tips for them to stay in my ears for any longer than 10 minutes. The wings don't stay on very well either but do help some to keep the buds from moving. Beefier wings would be preferable as well as foam tips for a better ear canal fit.The Bluetooth connection with my 2 year old phone has been a hit or miss. Sometimes, roughly once/week I hear a loud pop in my ears and the buds reboot. Afterwards they often don't reconnect to my phone and I have to put them back in the case to reset them.The volume seems to have a life of its own too. Despite putting the volume on my phone up to max it's barely noticeable in the buds. Then I have to open the Bose app and adjust the volume in there to get it back to where it should be.They lack shortcuts or customizable shortcuts that many other buds have but they work most of the time. It happens that they don't react at all when I try to answer a phonecall and I'm forced to pull out the phone to answer. I can still talk through the buds but the buttons are unresponsive. I've missed several calls because of this.Battery life is ok. They last me almost 7 hours and since they updated the firmware I can use one bud while the other is charging to extend it to the whole work day.The one thing that bugs me the most has to do with noise cancelling. There is no way to turn off noise cancelling completely. This means that even when you are using them in transparency mode, they will still cancel some sounds that they deem too loud: such as closing a car door or driving over a bump in the road or even taking to someone. Wind noise is also something it is happy to cancel out, however it's not very effective at that.If I'm using them in the car while listening to the radio on normal volume, they will limit the volume in my ears in a pretty rudementary and uncomfortable way. Not what you'd expect for almost C$400. Definitely need a way to turn this off and adjust the levels of it.So to sum it up, they're the best I could find, and I've tried lots of them, but for $375 I expect way more.",True,"Colour Name: Triple BlackSize

I tried a bunch of different earbuds (1MORE EVO, Soundcore by Anker, HUAWEI FreeBuds) and they were just awful in terms of sound quality compared to my Jabra.PROS:- Comfort. When I inserted them for the first time I couldn't feel them like there are nothing in there. They have that nice idea with a stability band so you kind of screw the earbud inside your ear which let you adjust the degree of sealing.- Sound quality is fantastic: they really can be called audiophiles. The bass is amazing (dnb, rap), the scene is explicit, and the most important thing is that the sound does not tire the ears.- Noise cancelation ANC is fantastic. It's like you are underwater. I don't care much about ANC but it's nice to have it. In my case, the transparency mode is more important since I use them when riding a bicycle.- Sweatproof and stability in the ear make them perfect for the gym.- Battery life is tolerable for long evenings, probably around 7 hours non-stop. Charging is quite fast.CONS:- Price is kind of high almost 500$ with taxes.- Case looks fragile (plastic), it's heavy, and the lid is flimsy. Can imagine what will happen if it falls on the asphalt, likely the lid will break off the body.- No app for windows, everything is geared toward smartphones (but it works fine with my laptop on win)- It doesn't support multiple sources like Jabra. So if it's connected to your laptop and you got the call on the smartphone, you would need to reconnect it to the smartphone manually. (When you take them out of the case they connect to the last source and if it's not available then to which is available right now.)- Would be nice to have a paper manual in the package. I had to search for it on the internet to learn what all those status lights mean and how the touch control works and how to connect them to other devices.- Not sure about touch control whether it's pros or cons. It's definitely better than buttons like in Jabra (quite uncomfortable to push buttons toward your ear, might be even painful). But it responds with a delay and precision is mediocre.UPDATED:- They can NOT work separately. The right bud passes sound to the left bud. For 2023 it's a shame-  Bluetooth connection on the street sometimes becomes glitchy and sound periodically disappears or sound on buds become out of sync- Buggy bluetooth connection: sometimes the laptop show like buds are connected but they don't. To fix that you need to reset the case and reconnect again which is a time-consuming operation.- Reconnecting between the laptop and the phone is a nightmare. For example, if you are waiting for a phone interview call, you have to reconnect buds to the phone in advance. So if you got an unexpected call, reconnecting on the fly IS UNREAL. That really sucks for 500-bucks buds compared to my old Jabra.- Sometimes just one bud loses connection forever. You have to reset the case to fix that. Sometimes it requires 2-5 resets to fix. One time it took me around 30 minutes.- a problem that drives me crazy: is that welcome sound when you just put buds in the ears. In the beginning, it sounded nice, some kind of bassy musical pipes, wow effect of the sound quality. But over time this sound becomes annoying and too loud. In the settings, you can't turn it off.- Settings in the app by the way turned out to be quite poor and useless. You don't have much to tweak or change.- Super strange bug in Twitter: when you click on a video, there is a 30% chance that buds will make a sharp and really loud noise, lose connection, and start reconnecting. Now, when I click on videos on Twitter, I close my eyes waiting for the blood to flow from my ears.",True,"Colour Name: Triple BlackSize

However, the passive noise isolation is quite bad so it brings down the quality of the noise cancelling.Also for this price, they're lacking in some features like customizable touch controls and an in-app equalizer which I would've thought were basically guaranteed on pricey wireless earbuds like these.Pros-(1)- Quite comfortable. I fell asleep with them on and woke up without any pain in my ears.-(2)- The case is hard to open because it's locked close with a button latch. I consider this a good thing because I prefer my earbuds to be secure in their case.Neutrals-(3)- Noise cancelling is ""fairly"" good. These seem to cancel noises properly, but are let down by their somewhat lacking passive noise isolation (preventing noise through the earbud itself) so you can still hear louder noises directly through the earbuds even if they're technically ""cancelling"" it. When I used these during my transit via train, I could constantly hear the low rumble of the heater fans and the high-pitch whirring of the motors when the train sped up or slowed down.As a side note, the noise cancelling is decent at not picking up wind gusts, although medium/strong wind gusts still cause a small amount of noise.-(4)- The default sound signature is quite nice and it'll probably satisfy a lot of people, but there's something about it that's lacking ""fun"". It has good clarity in mids and highs without being too harsh, and the bass is there albeit a bit pulled back. My issue lies with how the sub-bass below the bass is so pulled back that there's basically no ""oomph"" to any song I listen to which has sub-bass.-(5)- So far I haven't had any issues with connectivity, even in the middle of downtown. The only connection issue I've had is that the earbuds sometimes stutter for ~1 second every now and then (but only once or twice a day) before reconnecting like nothing happened.Cons-(6)- The passive sound isolation is pretty weak. I mentioned this when I talked about how it makes the noise cancelling worse, but it also prevents you from listening to music at medium/high volume. This is because your music just bleeds right out and you become a nuisance to everyone around you.With how much sound gets past the noise cancelling because of the lacking passive noise isolation, you end up wanting to listen to music at a slightly higher volume to drown out the extra outside noise, but doing that makes your noise leak out to your surroundings. The lacking noise isolation just brings about a lose-lose situation.-(7)- These are missing so many basic music controls it's not even funny. The only 2 touch controls you have for music are double-tap right earbud for play/pause, and press-and-hold left earbud to go to the next track. This is LITERALLY all you get as touch options. Every other touch combination is for calls and phone helper stuff with no options to customize them whatsoever.I am most certainly not happy about this lack of customization for the touch controls. The touch controls should let me play/pause, skip to next/previous track, and volume +/- if I want them to. If touch controls are the reason for these limitations, I would've preferred the physical buttons like the ones on the Bose SoundSport Free.Edit (2022-10-02): I've heard the app apparently lets you customize the touch controls now, so that's good to hear. Too bad it wasn't like that on release.-(8)- There's no equalizer in the Bose app. Sure, the default sound signature is okay and you could argue for third-party equalizers, but why don't they give us a simple equalizer in the app for these pricey $350 earbuds?ConclusionPersonally, I wouldn't recommend these simply because the passive noise isolation is weak. These earbuds do get quite a bit done right, like comfort and sound, but the weak noise isolation takes it down quite a few ranks.[--A bit about these compared to Sony WF-1000XM3's--]Since I have the Sony WF-1000XM3's which are basically direct competitors to these, I'll just point out that the Sony WF-1000XM3's are cheaper and have all the extra features which these Bose don't have.For instance, you can customize almost all your touch controls on the Sony, and there's an in-app equalizer to adjust the sound to your taste.Where the Sony's lose out to the Bose is in terms of water protection and comfort/fit. The Sony's have the absolute stupidest design when it comes to comfort/fit with no ear wings to hold the earbuds in your ears, so these Bose are 500% better at staying in your ears comfortably.",True,Colour Name: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],1,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,1829,762,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 259, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds

I tested all three ear fit options with only marginal differences in noise cancelling and settled on the 2+ size as the best fit for my ears. It must mean I've got Orc ears or something. I blame mum.I'll keep these Bose ear buds and they'll get some use as an alternate/back-up to the AirPod Pro's, but when I'm going on the plane or am in a situation when I want decent noise cancelling, I'll definitely be bringing the old over-the-ear models. They've yet to be beat by any other model or brand, plus it's nice to have the old school option along the lines of ""Oops, ran out of battery on a 16 hour flight...guess I'll just pop in a spare AA battery"" rather than doing the ""Oh bugger, now I'll have to listen to a screaming child for an hour while I do a Not-So-Quick-Charge"" and subtlety ask the flight attendant for three wee bottles of scotch and whether she could slip another one to that kid?Regarding the app, no issues there in terms of set-up or functionality, and was able to quickly set up other Bluetooth sources (in addition to my iPhone and iPad, I also utilize an Airfly for creating a Bluetooth output from my Denon amp and bedroom telly).Tip for people like me who can't resist generally buggering around with things, I ended up using the same trick I used with my AirPod Pro's to get a little better fit for noise cancelling. It found with AirPod Pros and with these Bose Ear Buds that the ear-tip fit thingy's plastic is a little too pliable and could do with having a bit more resistance:- using a pair of sharp scissors, I cut the narrower end off a pair of foam ear plugs (about 1cm or so...or about god knows what in Imperial measurements. Imperial lost me at '4 groats equals 1 scrotum').- using a leather punch (you know the ones, look like a pair of scissors but with a wheelie-thing housing different sized punches to create different sized holes), I punched out a hole down the centre of the foam tip.- scrunch up the narrower end of the ear tip fitter things that come with the ear buds and shove it through the hole in the foam ear plug pieces and fold back down. In a nutshell, this is basically just getting ear plug foam underneath the plastic bit that sits in your ear to give a bit of resistance.- For me at least, just having that extra bit of push from the foam ear plug pieces up against the business end of the ear bud plastic makes a bit of a difference in terms of a seal. I'm sure both the Apple overlords and Boseans have tested their ear tip creations and swear up, down and sideways that we're living the dream in terms of their ear-fit technology, but whether my ears lost out in the chromosome wars or no-one actually thought of a bit of pushy foam doing the trick, it works for me.

If you are looking for a great sound signature and don't care about noise cancelling, look somewhere else.  The biggest shock to me was that they don't block out sound like a QC35 would, these let in a bit more ambient sound.  I'm guessing this is so that you can hear what is around you (even in quiet mode).  Sound stage isn't very large, the highs and mids are lacking, and the bass, well its bose, there is plenty of bass. Problem is this does make for muddy sounding music, especially with female vocals.  I find the earbuds fit nicely, and do a good enough job on the subway blocking out noise.

5,Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds (honest review),https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R2SZTCONNVXW9R?ASIN=B08CJP6V6W,124 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on August 7, 2022",2022-08-07,Canada,,"I am a first to active noise cancelling (ANC) products, so here are my honest thoughts:PROS:- Shipping time was astonishingly fast.- The earbuds sound amazing whether you are at a low or high volume, the bass/medium/treble does not lack in any way.- The battery life for a single charge is amazing (6 hours)! They are definitely underselling these, since I even got to use them for around 7 hours too.- They allow wireless charging, so that’s a given.- They allow a tight but comfortable fit in the ear, so whether you are running or shaking, these earbuds will not budge a single bit.- They are sweat and splash resistant, so you don’t need to worry about taking too much care for them ;)- They allow great and accurate touch-controls, easy to use and you can pick from various options (volume control, pause/play, ANC changes, voice-control assistent, calls, etc.)- These earbuds allow up to 11 noise cancelling options, from ‘Aware mode’ (transparency mode) to ‘Quiet Mode’ (full noise cancelling).- Since I am a first to ANC products, I can’t give an accurate review on how the ANC is, however, from my honest opinion, it isn’t that bad! They really do feel like a good pair of earplugs.- The case has a button to securely lock it and prevent the earbuds from flying on if you accidentally drop them.- The case also indicates the amount of battery it has left with the given 5 LED lights.- Supports quick connection to 11 multiple devices (can only be connected at one at the time).- Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds has a quick charge option: 15-mins charge for a 2 hours of playback.- Neither case nor earbuds will be overcharged if left charging overnight.- Can turn on ANC when no music is playing.CONS:- Granted we are moving to a wireless earbuds/headphones world, these Bose Quietcomfort earbuds’ charging case is a bit large to carry around. It fits snugly in a bag, but in your pocket, not so much.- You can’t sleep with these on, unless if you sleep on your back. Otherwise, it will be quite uncomfortable.- Some people might complain about the short battery life the case offers an additional 12 hours of battery life to earbuds: a total of 18 hours combining both earbuds and case.- The earbuds take 2 hours for a complete charge from 0% to 100%.- The charging time for the case alone (0 LEDs to 5 LEDs) is 3 hours.WARNING! (All ANC products have a noise floor, including these Bose Quietcomfort earbuds)I am a first to ANC products, hence I have to share this warning to my fellow people who are also a first to ANC products. Since ANC is a product of an anti-phase wave to the sounds around you, which is emitted by a microphone within the earbuds, the earbuds themselves have a hissing sound, most noticeable when there is no music playing. The hissing/noise floor of the earbuds themselves does not increase nor decrease as ANC goes higher or lower. However, in transparency mode, the surrounding sounds will be projected louder than actual when no major sound in your surroundings is present, thus the hissing sound/noise floor might appear louder than usual (rest assured, it’s just your earbuds trying to project a real sound equivalent to complete silence). However, the hissing/noise floor of the earbuds when the ANC is maxed out is present, but not really loud. And yes, the noise floor can still be heard if music is playing, but only when the music is at a low volume, otherwise, no noise floor can be heard (noise floor never becomes louder depending of ANC).Thank you for taking your time to read this review, I hope it helped you on narrowing out some aspects you already knew and clearing out on those you didn’t know yet.Have a splendid day filled with wonders y’all! :)",True,Colour Name: BlackStyle: QuietComfort Earbuds,[],1,B08CJP6V6W,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08CJP6V6W?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B08CJP6V6W&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,23854,3647,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 259, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds

I do not understand why some reviews are so good for the Apple AirPods Pro. The  noise cancelling is really not that great, far inferior to Bose and Samsung earbuds. The Apple AirPods Pro I had kept emitting funny noises and the left one was hissing. Apple exchanged it. It worked for a while but the same type of  problems came back. This time I was out of their warranty.  I then bought the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro. Used them for a week. Returned them. The noise cancelling was quite good, better then Apple. I did not like the fit. The reason I returned them had to do with 2 things: they would skip ounce in a while, more then what I found acceptable and once in a while, one of the buds would not work.  If you put it back in the case, put it back on then it would work. Very annoying. After the Apple adventure, I did not take any chances and returned them.  Then I bought Bose QuietComfort Noise Cancelling Earbuds and I have been using them for a month.  They are by far the best of the 3. The  noise cancelling is really the best. I have done the same noise test with all of them. Bose wins! The fit is excellent. You kind of forget you are wearing them. They have little wings that keeps them in the ears. The sound quality is very good, better then Apple and on par with Samsung. You can adjust the noise cancelling by using their App or tapping on the left earbud.  You can program it so that when your phone is ringing, if you insert the earbuds in your ear, it connects automatically to the phone. That said, they are not perfect. I would have liked them to provide a voice feedback when you tap the noise cancelling earbud. I have 4 Apple devices. When you switch from a device to an other, you have to use their App to disconnect it from the previous device and connect it to the new one. That is somewhat annoying.  Apple is better for that aspect. Also, they cost more then Apple or Samsung. Nevertheless I am quite pleased with my Bose QuietComfort Noise Cancelling Earbuds. I’ll stick with them.

My earbuds are a recent SoundSport model, and they're great. I had no reason to replace them.. but I'd been patiently waiting for Bose to offer a true wireless option. All this means is that I fully intended on returning these QuietComfort Earbuds if they *didn't* blow my mind.And they did.The noise cancellation is truly remarkable. I work in a laboratory environment with lots of ambient noise (pumps, fans, equipment running). When I double tap the left earbud to switch from 0 -> max noise cancellation, it's like I'm turning off the world around me. I can audibly hear every background noise vanish. Add to that music or a podcast for some active noise in the ear, and you can barely hear anything.The sound quality, to me, is excellent. That said, I know Bose has a specific equalizer tuning that Bose newcomers might not like, or aren't used to. They sound different (not worse of better) than competing mid/high-end offerings from the likes of Sony and Sennheiser. Worth keeping in mind. The Bluetooth connectivity is excellent (damn-near perfect) because Bose FINALLY moved to Bluetooth 5.1, and it makes a big difference.The battery life is decent. I can almost get through a full day of work on one charge. The charging case makes recharging very easy, though, so whenever they do die, one can simply forget about them for ~1 hour in their case, and they're good as new. With battery tech moving forward rapidly, I would expect the gen. 2 QuietComfort Earbuds, whenever released, to have a >8 hour run time. That would be a 5-star battery life IMO.One word of caution. It seems that the battery life indicator on the charging case is a little.. dumb. There are 5 LEDs to indicate remaining battery (5 = full, 1 = almost empty) but my charging case reaches empty with 3 lights remaining.

They give the option to toggle between modes like transparency and ANC, customize your earbuds name's and that's pretty much it and nothing more . There's no eq settings which I would honestly love but eh whatever no big problem, they are already good sounding but you know I like my customization.-ANC and transparency mode.ANC is acceptable, as a student I would like to have the noise of my classroom just to disappear but these they definitely block out noise from a far but they don't really cancel much if it's too loud or a bit more up close they are acceptable. They are like if you dunk your head underwater, you definitely can't hear people from a far but from up close and near you, you can definitely hear it.Transparency mode is such a disappointment, it's just make everything sound fuzzy and you can't hear voice if someone talking to you while playing music.

Everything else, JESUS CHRIST. Perhaps my biggest gripe with this product was the battery life. I would come into work everyday at 9am with these earbuds fully charged and by noon they were dead. Sometimes sooner. 3 Hours? That is insane. The microphone quality is unusable. Nobody I spoke to on the phone could hear me and that was one of the main reasons I bought wireless earbuds. It got better as time went on, but for the first week or two, I had serious issues with connecting these earbuds to my phone. Last but not least, the build quality of the case is abysmal. Everytime I dropped the case, the ear buds would fly out of it and I'd have to find them on the floor. This happened at least a dozen times (I'm a klutz I know). There's no seal or safety clip that fastens the earbuds into the case. Just a very cheap magnet that holds them in place. Again, not what you expect when you spend this much money on a pair of earbuds. In conclusion, I took it as a sign that when I dropped the case again and the earbuds flew so far away that to this day I can only find one, that I should have refunded this product within a week of getting it but I decided to give it a chance. It's pretty obvious that after Apple acquired Beats that they want to run a monopoly on the wireless earbud market by forcing everyone to get AirPods for 300 dollars so even if you spend 200 dollars, the product won't be fully optimized on purpose for iOs.

A couple of things:1. Last week I bought one pair for my partner as she wanted a pair of ANC buds. I ordered a grey colour, and it works fine she says the ACN is ok too. So I bought another pair for myself on May 9 2023. I went for the black colour and I can tell most ppl will get black too. Upon receipt of the black one, things went to a different direcions. The buds battery was dead (0% on the case and the right bud), this said the buds had been used and then returned, as my gfs paired with with the phone instantly when opening the box. After charging for about 5 min, I paired it with my iPhone, and the warranty says expires on Mar 26, 2024. so this proved that it had been returned, at least once.2. After wearing it for a couple of hours, I noticed UNUSUALLY loud white noise, I understand it's normal to have white noise on ACN earphones, I also owned Bose QC30, I get it, but this beats buds, it's like someone screaming, literally, in your ears, it almost covered the music playing. I googled it and saw many similar issues. I also reset the buds like listed on its website. After that, the volume turned way too low, even I turn my volume settings to the maximum, I still can barely hear it. So I returned it and left a sticker in the package letting them know do not sell it to another person. It's broken. 3. Today (May 10,2023), I received a replacement from beats, and this pair has also been returned as the battery is also dead when pairing, but may be less than a month's ago as it's still eligible for apple care plus ( eligible in the first 60 days), luckily the white noise level is normal on this new pair and I will keep it. I understand free return is Amazon's policy, but quality control is really poor on beats end too. Overall, the sound quality and ACN is fair, worth the discounted price, but I will not recommend it if it's the full price.

Welp those don’t work either…. I ordered the foam masters for the gen 2s and they are actually worse than the stock ones. Can only get about 1-3 min of seal with the eartips supplied with the earbuds before they fall out. No bueno. At all. Makes me want to return them but everything else is so convenient about them. Hopefully the little bumpers I ordered will help keep them in my ears! Otherwise they r being returned. Maybe I’ll consider if they redesign them completely. Also the sound quality is very acceptable for me… but anything past 70% vol sounds atrocious, I guess that’s understandable.Lover volumes using Apple Music they sounds great and the spatial sounds very open and expansive, indeed like the sounds is coming from the phone with “iPhone tracked” (low to mid vol)  and fixed mode makes them sound like headphones.

I never liked wired Apple headphones. They hurt my ears and would not stay in. The AirPods were basically flawless. I just wanted more on-bud controls and noise cancelling. Enter AirPods Pro. I was super excited to treat myself to upgraded headphones. I love my Bose QC45 over the ear for sound quality and noise cancelling, but as a glasses wearer, they hurt my ears and head so bad after a short time. After having the AirPods Pro for a few weeks, I can't help but feel a little sad that they will not stay in my ears. I am using the biggest silicone tips. They gradually work themselves out of my ear and fall off my head. This is just sitting at my desk. If I have a snack or eat lunch, they come out quicker. One thing that has helped somewhat is cleaning them and my ear canal with an alcohol wipe every day before use. I think everything is great about the AirPods Pro except for the fit. I didn't know there were other tips, so I guess I will search for foam to see if those will stay in my ears.

The noise cancellation is impressive, but tends to lend a sort of metallic, crunchy note to sounds that make it through, which for me has a kind of nails-on-blackboard effect; overall the cancellation is good enough to outweigh that issue.The only real problem with these is that the fit is awful. I find myself readjusting them (screwing them back into my ear canal to reseal the fit) every 5-10 minutes, and if I wear them under a beanie it's worse. If I'm chewing or talking, the movement of the muscles around my ear is actually enough to make them fall out completely. I've tried a couple of different tips and this problem is persistent, even though the tips fit well enough to pass the pods seal test. At this price point, bad fit is totally unacceptable, and I'm pretty annoyed at Apple for not correcting the design substantially in this second generation. I'm currently looking at custom molded tips, which will turn these into more like $400+ headphones and make them much more obnoxious to charge.

The hard plastic on the eartips that snaps onto the earbud is so ingenious. Personally, I don't like eartips because I need to hear my surroundings, but these eartips are so comfortable. You can wear them without the eartips, and they are just as great. One thing, though, is why did they choose the most slippery material, lmao?Now, the reason I returned these earbuds is because they are not Windows PC-friendly. I've tried everything from updating and changing drivers to almost every troubleshooting and CMD option out there. I even let a support agent take control of my PC to try to fix the problem, but nothing fixed the terrible audio glitching. It's so bad that the earbuds are unusable on Windows PCs.So, I really think Apple made the AirPods Pro 2 perform terribly on non-Apple devices on purpose.

4,People on work calls keep asking me what my headset is - because it sounds so good,,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023",2023-12-29,United States,,"I finally stopped resisting and got myself a set of airpods, and really wish I had done so sooner. These are every bit of the quality and high standard that's expected with Apple products (and the premium price to go with it).I needed some kind of hands free earbuds or bluetooth device for Teams and phone calls, and tried all kinds of things, spent over $200 with Jabra and got something that had a complicated app, poor running time, and ultimately was terrible for calls, picking up a lot of noise especially wind noise when outside. Then I bought 2 different Bluetooth headsets from Plantronics and couldn't find anything approaching an actual good level of quality, even after spending upwards of $100.Syncing the Airpods to my iPad tablet, Windows computer, and Samsung smartphone worked great and was easy. It also seems to do well at ""sensing"" what device I'm trying to use, if I put the earbuds in while joining a teams call or phone call it usually is already connected without needing to do a lot of switching in the device. Finally, active noise cancelling is a huge benefit. I fly a lot and don't know what I'd do without noise cancelling on a plane.Finally, the downsides: First, the Find Me software is useless. These are supposed to have Airtags built in, for both the case and the airpods themselves, but it doesn't seem to work, and it's a well known problem, with several pages of threads on Apple's support forums. I've tried resetting absolutely everything and my iPad won't see the airpods on the list, even if it's connected to them via bluetooth and they're right next to it. So beware of that, if you're expecting their AirTag service to find these when you lose them - it won't. Fortunately you can buy replacement parts, aftermarket cases are as low as $35, and Apple sells individual buds for about $80 each.Second and it goes along with the first problem, but the case lid is ""flappy"" for a lack of a better word. It doesn't really latch, which means if you drop the case, the lid is apt to flap open and the airpods will tumble out with it. Which that going along with the problem of the Find Me software not working right becomes a real issue. With Find Me failing you can't even ""beep"" them like you're supposed to be able to do, when I lost them once (cats ended up knocking them off the table then carrying them around the house like toys) I ended up just forcing them to be on in the bluetooth settings (even if not in your ear) and then just playing loud beeps through a youtube video.

5,New iPhone used and seriously impressed,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R1B41PWNJ5Y0N?ASIN=B0CHWRXH8B,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on November 25, 2023",2023-11-25,Canada,,"I was a Samsung android user for about 15 years and finally decided to make the switch to iPhone with the new 15 Pro lineup, as I love my  M1 MBP and I have been following Apple  products from afar since. Now that the 15 lineup is USB C, I decided to go all in on the Apple ecosystem.I am blown away by these airpods. Thankfully the second gens come with XS ear tips, because that's the only size that doesn't slowly push themselves out of my ear.But let me get to what I really love about these things:- the seamless transfer of connection between my M1 macbook pro and iPhone. It happens in about 1.5 seconds flat as soon as I begin playing audio/video on another device. And somehow it also knows when I don't need it to transfer?! I don't even know.-the charging speed of the pods themseld. I think I just popped them into the case for 10 mins, less than 15 for sure, and they jumped from 18% charge to 80% just like that.-transparency and noise cancellation. Remarkable and I use both depending on my environment. Haven't really found a use for Adaptive mode after a while, but that's ok. When you're walking on a busy street, noise cancellation is so soothing. Drowns out like 90-95% of the traffic sounds.-conversational awareness is great too, but I generally leave it off unless I'm in a grocery store or somewhere that I might need to interrupt the audio by speaking to someone for a few seconds. Only time I use it.- Con: they're super slippery! I have dropped the pods a couple of times because of this, especially when you get any skin oils on them, but no damage so far. I also just got a silicone cover for the charging case, in hopes that the pods don't just eject themselves when you drop the whole case on the floor. I think that fixed my concern in some quick tests from a 2 foot drop on carpet, because I've seen them eject from that height before.BONUS: These airpod pro 2s with USB C have a special feature that lightning cable pro 2s do not! Lossless audio, but this only applies to using them with the Vision Pro. I probably won't but the Vision Pro any time soon, but it's good to know that I will have that feature should I ever get them in the future.Buy these at full price or especially buy them when you see them 10-17% off.

I've even figured out a workaround the disconnection problem by either removing the right earbud and giving it a shake, or by tapping on it a bunch until it reconnects. But the final straw was the wind noise. Imagine a hissing feedback but it's literally the sound of wind, coming from the right earbud, indoors. It's strange and there's no fixing it. I've factory reset the earbuds. Repaired them from all my devices. Stopped using them for a little while and coming back to them. Still there.After owning the Linkbuds S for a month and a half, I'm returning them. They have way too many issues for such new earbuds. I'm going to wait until I've read that all of these issues have been resolved.

They have solid value for money, ANC, Sound and Comfort. The design is awesome, I really like the stemless sleek design. The app/features are excellent. Unfortunately the battery life is pretty mid and the build quality feels cheap, especially the case.If you want a more in depth review. Read below.Sound 3.5/5Noise cancelling 4/5Build quality 3/5Battery 3.5/5Features & App support 5/5Comfort 4/5Aesthetics 4.5/5Overall 4/5SoundThe sound is good. I have no problems with it but I’m also by no means an audiophile or even an enthusiast. To the average ear, these are good and you’ll most likely have no complaints, but you also won’t be blown away. 3.5/5ANCThe noise cancelling is really good. It’s better than my Onemore sono flow overear headphones but I’ve never used the xm5’s and quiet comforts of the world so I can’t really compare them. If thats really your budget you probably don’t need to be reading this review. The passthrough mode is also good, they have some features that turn it on and off depending on what you’re doing which I’ll get to later. 4/5Build QualityI haven’t had any technical issues outside of some very infrequent cutting while walking. This is pretty much unavoidable with bluetooth earbuds though and will happen even with the XM5s.My biggest problem with these is the build quality. The ear buds themselves are fine. They’re mat black which is cool but its like a rough sandpapery texture that feels a bit odd. They’re super light, (which I guess they were going for) and the silicone tips are standard. The real problem though is the case. It’s so light it feels hollow, like if I press hard enough I could break it just with my thumb (probably not but thats what it feels like). It doesn’t feel like a premium product or even as nice as the original airpods I upgraded from. Granted, they’re supposed to be that middle tier, not premium but not entry level. Unfortunately in terms of build and feel, they are more akin to the latter.BatteryThe battery is fine, they’re not nearly as long as the airpods so that sucks. If you’re doing long study/work sessions like 5+ hours without putting them back in the case, they’ll get close to dying.The case battery is decent but you’ll have to charge it every 2-4 days assuming heavy - average use. Airpods I used to charge once a week, sometimes less. 3.5/5Features and APP supportOkay again, I’m not an audiophile so if you’re looking for a good understanding of the different EQ options you’re out of luck. From what reddit says, they’re decent. BUT from an average person’s perspective, the other features are fantastic. The app is great, lots of features lots of settings but not in an overwhelming way. You can use alexa on them which is cool although she’s can be a bit buggy sometimes. They also have a chat to mute function which automatically stops music and turns on passthrough mode when you start talking and reverses that after a few seconds when you stop. It might not be for everyone, it takes a few seconds to work sometimes but I like it. They also have different tapping functions, if you tap on the left ear it switches between ANC, Passthrough and standard, you can also remove one of these and just have it switch between two (I removed standard). Right ear pauses/plays (one tap) or goes to the next song (two) or goes back to the previous (three). Overall the features are very cool and seems to be where they put their money. 5/5ComfortI find these pretty comfortable even after 5-6 hours of having them in. Not much else to say really. If you’re worried about that weird ringing feeling that some noise cancelling has, I didn’t get that with these. The silicone tips are ordinary but they come in 4 different sizes which is nice. I’ve never tried foam tips, if thats your thing you can probably buy third party tips. 4/5AestheticsTo be honest, a major factor in buying these over the airpods was that they’re black and stemless. The white ones some people think look like cotton balls although they’re not as bad as Galaxy buds and other thicker ones. The black ones though are suuuuper sleek and you can barely see them when you’re looking straight in the mirror. They barely protrude from the ear. This also makes it really nice for laying on them if thats something you’re interested in. 4/5I took like 30 mins out if my day to write this so if you made it this far cool! But also, you’re probably getting review burn out and need to chill lol.

4,A Good Pair of Sony Earbuds... Albeit With Some Slight Caveats.,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y2ESJ7TBCMV7?ASIN=B09YL76VSR,17 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on February 22, 2023",2023-02-22,Canada,,"Ever since I got these back in January, I had an excellent time using them. The noise cancelation was that on-par with my Sony WF-1000XM3, some convenience features that make using the LinkBuds S like Spotify Tap and Google Assistant integration, alongside with Fast Pair (on Android devices only) a breeze, and the build quality is as good as any other high-end product from Sony. Although there's no Qi wireless charging support, and the case maybe prone to scratch damage (hence I recommend a case for these sorts of things), it's fair given for what is given with the current price. However, I've taken into some consideration with using these earbuds, and alongside two of the main issues I had with my experience after a month of usage:1. The big issue being for me was with the Noise Cancelation/Ambient Sound. I've had my first pair producing a slight wind noise on my right earbud, and there was no way of getting rid of it. The only solution that I was given was to turn off ANC completely, which ruined the experience altogether. Plus, it even affected call quality and that I wasn't able to use Speak-to-Chat as a result. This happened three weeks after receiving them. I've since requested a replacement unit, and have now taken extra precautions in regards to this massive problem. Unless my first unit was defective, I really can't say for sure as there are a few incidents from other users having the exact same situation. It could be either a hardware or software flaw from what I know, but I wouldn't wanna risk it. I've haven't updated my second pair to the latest version as of now, and have turned off Ambient Sound Control and ANC until there's some resolution.2. Battery life is another problem that has also plagued my first pair. After setting it up right out of box, I noticed one earbud having drained from 100-0% faster than the other. This wasn't what I was expecting to have happen to me after setting everything up. A few days later, the issue was slowly going away, though I was still constantly seeing either the right or left bud chewing through battery life more and more. It was concerning to me, especially with the amount of cycles that a pair like these are supposed to last. The more the battery drains and charges, the more charge cycles you go through, and therefore the battery health goes down with it (similar to a phone or power bank). Much like the second pair, I've turned off ANC and Ambient Sound Control, which does dramatically improve the products lifespan while wearing them. Though, it's a bit frustrating to know that some of the best features on these earbuds are the main cause of quick battery drain.So while I have enjoyed using these Sony LinkBuds S wireless earbuds for a month now, it's hard to say for sure if I would recommend it to others. Unless the issues I have are resolved in a future hardware update, I would give these Sony buds a pass for now. It's really good for the price point, but not so much in terms of reliability or longevity.",True,Colour Name: Black,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/411FEF1WILL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ObabwznmL._SY88.jpg']",2,B09YL76VSR,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09YL76VSR?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09YL76VSR&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,658,181,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 168, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony Linkbuds S

4,"Great sound, decent ANC, perfect fit",https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R15NEQH34PRP90?ASIN=B09YL76VSR,14 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on June 20, 2022",2022-06-20,Canada,,"I bought these to replace a set of Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 that sounded great for the price but they just wouldn't stay in my ears no matter which tips and wings I would choose. Also, I didn't find the noise cancelling effective enough for my needs ( I work in a pretty noisy environment). So I figured I'd try the Sony Linkbuds S since a lot of reviews I read and watched said they were a better fit for smaller ears. They do feel like they go deeper in your ear canal and sit better in the ear. They are also very light, so they aren't fatiguing to wear for long periods of time.The sound of the Linkbuds S is a little on the dark side straight out of the box, but I prefer a more laid back and warmer sound. It's easy to get more details in the highs and mids within the app's EQ on my cellphone. The bass is not very strong, but it stays punchy and detailed without getting muddy.The active noise cancelling is very good once you found the right tips, although it's not as good as what I get out of my pair of Sony WH-1000XM2 headphones. Still, it does a decent job. The only negative point is that there is a lot of hiss (noise) in the Ambient Sound mode. The sound does feel electronically processed. But I don't use these earbuds in Ambient Sound mode so it's not so much of a concern to me. EDIT: After having had these for a few months now, I find that with the right tips, the passive noise cancelling works better than the active noise cancelling. This is even better since the passive noise cancelling doesn't drain the battery as much as the ANC.Also, being that these are pretty small earbuds, the battery life is not great. But I can easily charge them in the case while I eat lunch and I'll be good for my 8 hours shift.In clonclusion, at $299 they are a little pricey but I think they are still a great value.

Surely a master of none compared to Airpods Pro (transparency mode king), Sony WF-1000XM4 (noise cancelling king) and sound quality depends who you ask...Side note: Soundcore Life P3 actually fit quite well but the noise cancelling is not quite as good and they are also a bit bulkier horizontally due to the stem design. They also crapped out on me within a month and one bud decided to never make sound again....Again though, for someone with small ears, all these higher quality buds mean nothing if the fit sucks and the seal in your canal is not good. Really lucked out that these came out just at the tail end my earbuds hunt.The App does everything you need but man does the UI overcomplicate things.

If you have small ear canals, I would advise against purchasing them as they may not fit properly and could break.The Sony LinkBuds S are a waste of money. The materials used in their construction feels cheap, and the design is so poor it breaks during very light use. If your ear canal is too small, the buds can break due to compressive forces on the weak plastic sound nozzle, resulting in a permanent and constant blowing sound out of one or both of the buds when active noise cancelling (ANC) is on. Additionally, pushing on the metal grill on the outside of the buds when inserting them into your ears can cause them to break, resulting in a squealing sound when the active noise cancellation (ANC) is on (I think they damaged my hearing they squealed so loud).How these simple issues were not discovered during the design process or quality control of this product is  beyond me. These ear buds should be recalled as they are a danger to people's hearing due to the sudden and VERY loud squealing when they break, which, as stated, are very easy to break accidently. Normal use should not break a product after only 2 months, or, for my 3rd set, in 2 days. If Sony fixed these issues and made the product more ""durable"" (Though making a product that withstands normal use after 2 months shouldn't be considered ""durable."" It should just be standard) then these ear buds would be fantastic, but until then, steer clear.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],3,B09YL76VSR,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09YL76VSR?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09YL76VSR&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=one_star&sortBy=helpful,266,164,oneStar,"{'price': {'value': 168, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony Linkbuds S

In theory they work great, you can listen to music while you ride and they sound decent enough. In practice, they are the most problematic headphones I've ever owned (currently have over 15 pairs from various brands). The bluetooth range is terrible and constantly drops out while riding. This is influenced by the position of the phone in my rear pockets on my jersey when I ride. If I don't put it directly in the middle, then the dropouts are far worse. Keep in mind this puts the phone only 2-3 feet max from the headphones.When you turn your head to shoulder check, the audio cuts out. Quite often when it comes back, the headphones will be out of sync, so you end up with very choppy, off beat audio. This happens every 3rd shoulder check I would say.I have gone through all the various troubleshooting steps, I have updated the firmware, and I have tested many different methods to stop this from happening.If you are sitting perfectly still with your phone near you, you likely won't experience this. If you are cycling along at 30km/h, they work very poorly and are very frustrating to use.Other observations -- Battery life is not amazing. An hour phone call will kill them. Other brands I get multiple hours of listening and talk before needing a charge.- The touch gestures work sporadically, and you can't configure them as flexibly as you can with other brands. You have to use their pre-selected function sets and can't mix and match commands.- The default connection type it wants to use is Spotify Connect if you have Spotify installed on your device. This is extremely unstable in my experience. Using Deezer is much more stable as it's forcing Bluetooth I believe. I can't remove the Spotify connect functionality no matter what I try.- The fit/stay in your ears is hit and miss. I find myself adjusting them often. I have at least 3 times lost one while riding, forcing me to double back and find it. I have the grey ones, and they are the EXACT color of some asphalt, making them impossible to find.

It includes 5 sizes for the ""wing tip"" on the back of the earbuds, yet none of the sizes properly fit my ears. I'm somehow about halfway between the small and medium size - small is too small and falls out, medium is too large and pops out. Even just smiling displaces them in my ears, so exercising or jogging in them would be impossible.For the short period of time they're in my ears before falling out, they're terrific. They're probably the most comfortable earbuds I've ever used, the ""open"" design works perfectly and I could hear everything around me as if I wasn't wearing earbuds, and sound quality is amazing for wireless earbuds. There's almost no bass, because of the design, but they have a much more open and wider soundstage than any wireless earbud I've used before. Plus mids are good and highs are clear. I find the positives more than make up for the lack of bass, but that's just my preference (I mainly listen to rock and alternative, so little ti no bass isn't the end of the world for me. Just means kick drums don't have much of an oomph to them). I did tweak the equalizer settings in the Sony app and tune it to what sounded best to me - audio quality right out of the box with a flat eq isn't anything special.I wanted earbuds to pair with my Samsung galaxy watch 4 for jogging specifically, but wanted ones that don't directly go inside my ear canals. That means my options boiled down to these, or the galaxy buds live. So I got both to see which one I liked better. To directly compared them:Fit: the Buds Live fit me significantly better than the Linkbuds do, but this is subjective and won't be the same for everyone. I can shake my head as hard as I possibly can and the Buds don't budge an inch. Meanwhile smiling makes the Linkbuds fall out. Two areas the Linkbuds do win here, though, are comfort and putting them in properly. I found the Linkbuds far more comfortable to wear for short periods than the Live. I couldn't test long term comfort because of how easily the Linkbuds fall out of my ears, though. The Linkbuds are also easier to put in your ears the ""correct"" way, meanwhile I still sometimes struggle to put the Buds properly in which leads to muffled audio until I adjust them into the correct position.Sound quality: the Linkbuds easily win in this category. The Buds have mildly more bass (we're talking 2.5/10 vs 1/10), but mids, highs, and the soundstage are all much better on the Linkbuds.Build quality: for the earbuds, the Linkbuds win by a mile. The earbuds themselves just feel so much higher quality, I much prefer the matte plastic used over the glossy plastic of the Buds. I also like the donut design more than the bean Buds, and the Linkbuds are also physically smaller which I like. In terms of the cases, though, the Buds win. The plastic in the Linkbuds case also feels nicer to the touch, and it uses a physically latch to open and close which is nice, but the Buds case supports wireless charging (the Linkbuds case does not) which is a huge advantage to me. The Buds also magnetically slide into their proper place, the Linkbuds need to be ""clicked"" into place or they won't charge. Lastly the Buds case has a larger battery which means more recharge time before depletion.Features: this one's a toss up. Wireless charging in the case is a pretty big one for me, in favour of the Buds, but the Linkbuds have a fully adjustable eq which is a massive (the Buds have multiple preset equalizers, no custom eq'ing). The open design of the Linkbuds also works significantly better than the transparency mode on the Buds. The Buds Live do feature active noise cancelling, but it's a joke and barely does anything at all. Lastly I have both a Samsung phone and smartwatch, so the Buds Live do automatically switch between devices for me. It's nice to have, but I have Sony XM4 headphones for my phone and only use the Buds with my Galaxy Watch, making the feature not especially useful. Both earbuds support some kind of ""360 audio"" but I didn't care for either implementation.Conclusion: If the Linkbuds had properly fit me, I would've chosen them over the Buds Live. But, because they fall out every 30-60 seconds, they were completely useless and all of their benefits and comparison wins were meaningless. I had no choice but to go with the Buds Live.

Turning that off helped, but eating still occasionally triggers it (though that seems to have improved a bit after a recent firmware update, so at least they're working on it).The ""talk to pause"" feature worked well, but again - just normal jaw movements could accidentally trigger it, so I had to turn it off.The main reason I got them is because earbuds that actually go into your ear canal a bit bother me - these are much more comfortable, so I'm happy to tolerate the minor nuisances, most of which seem to be the type of thing that might be solvable with firmware updates, so I'm hopeful that they will get better.The right earbud has developed a slight buzzing after I cleaned them with isopropyl alcohol - that's probably my fault, the IPA probably damaged an O ring or something, but there were no warnings against using IPA for cleaning them, and IPA is generally the go-to for cleaning electronics.

4,It's a mixed bag [for me],https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q69QU6GTBJRJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,15 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on April 28, 2022",2022-04-28,Canada,,"These are sort of a mixed bag. I didn't buy/preorder these right after seeing it featured on LTT's Shortcircuit... yep.The bad:1. Battery life - put simply, they're not very good. Sony advertises up to 5.5 hours per charge. In my experience however, they took 2.5 hours to go from fully charged to 20% at around 50% volume. That's even worse than Sony's WF-1000XM3's (which I also own).2. Audio quality OR stable connection - setting the LinkBuds to prioritize audio quality results in the sound output being fairly close to the WF-1000XM3's, but at the expense of frequent connection dropouts. Setting them to prioritize connection quality makes them sound marginally worse.3. With the ""Wide Area Tap"" feature enabled, the LinkBuds have an unfortunate tendency to interpret jaw movement as taps. I was eating a burger, so my fingers were nowhere near my ears - yet the music kept pausing and restarting, because the LinkBuds thought I was double-tapping via my jaws...4. The default setting for Speak-to-chat is a little too sensitive for me. I had to set it to Low to avoid unnecessarily pausing audio all the time.5. There is no user configurable option to customize double/triple taps to perform functions that are different from the various presets offered in the app.6. No wireless charging on the case.The good:1. Fit - Of the five wingtip sizes, I have to use the XL wingtips to prevent them from falling out. If my ears are any larger I'd have no choice but to return them. Once they're fitted in my ears, though, they're more secure than the WF-1000XM3's, with none of the discomfort that all but stopped me from using those high-end TWS.2. ""Open"" back - the LinkBuds do not block or cancel external sounds. I don't have to turn on ""transparency mode"" or hold my hand over my ear (or earcup) in a weird way, just to be aware of the surrounding environment.3. Audio quality - I did write that they sound marginally worse when the LinkBuds are set to prioritize connection quality. Truth be told, they're not all that bad, especially considering the speaker design and the total absence of noise cancellation.4. Size - The LinkBuds case is thicker than the OG Apple AirPods (yes, I still have them!) while being slightly smaller on width/length. At the same time, it's almost HALF the size of the WF-1000XM3's. These are easily pocketable.Would I recommend the LinkBuds to anyone? No. They are TWS, yes, but the similarities stop beyond that, because these are TWS with the inherent disadvantages of open-back headphones. Battery life is not good, there's no sugarcoating it.Then why should I rate these 4 stars instead of 3? Simple. The vast majority of TWS on the market are closed-back, many of them with eartips and active noise cancellation. If I want a conventional TWS I can just buy some Samsung ""Beans"". The LinkBuds are open-back TWS, more open than AirPods, without the bone conduction tech that is otherwise mandatory this side of Bluetooth headphones. It's easier to rate highly when the choices are more limited, as is the case here.",True,Colour Name: White,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NVe7mzXoL._SY88.jpg'],2,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,580,156,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony Linkbuds original

5,A safe alternative to earbuds for runners and cyclists.,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R3FMT0P0EZ4HSH?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on October 15, 2022",2022-10-15,Canada,,"While I appreciate listening to music and podcasts on long runs, I tend not to use headphones as I am uncomfortable with the isolation earbuds provide, and find earbuds often make a booming noise due to bone conduction.I have used the Bose Sport Open Earbuds in the past with good results, and when Sony came out with their take I decided to give them a try. Here’s my opinion on the Sony units. Your mileage may vary.The Sony LinkBuds are small and light, and fit easily in your ear. The different sized stability loops ensure a proper fit. And a proper fit is essential to keep these in your ear and to dial in the sound. With the wrong sized loop, these sound thin and harsh and will pop out of your head. Experiment with the right sized loop for your ear, and the buds will feel locked in, and the sound will be acceptable.I hesitate to talk about the sound, as each of us has different requirements. I was not looking for hifi sound, just a pleasing sound that allowed me to listen to music while letting in ambient sound. The LinkBuds, once I had experimented with fit, met my needs perfectly. If you are bass-head, move on, as you cannot get booming bass out of an open backed earbud.One feature I thought I would love was the speech feature, which cuts the sound when you speak. This worked well on most days, but I find wind will trigger it, so I turn that feature off on very windy days (Which is basically every day on PEI.).I tested the LinkBuds with my iPhone XS, and the app worked flawlessly. I don’t run with my phone, and while I could use the LinkBuds on my older iPod, the app would not load, so functions were more limited.The charging case is tiny and provides an internal battery. I like how the earbuds snap into the case with a satisfying click. I also run with PowerBeats, and have found I often don’t get a correct fit in the case resulting in a dead earbud.Will these replace the Bose? No, as I prefer the warm, tubey Bose signature sound. But I do find the LinkBuds perform better in wind, and do not interfere with the googles I often have to wear in the winter. They each have their advantages, and I will use both happily. If I had to pick one pair, it would be the Bose, but I don’t think Bose is still selling these anymore. They cost the same.Hope that helps, and I wish you all miles of smiles, safely aware of your surroundings.",True,Colour Name: Gray,[],1,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1336,230,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony Linkbuds original

From seamless communication in work environments to immersive media consumption, these earbuds have consistently impressed me. In this updated review, I will merge my previous thoughts with new insights to provide a comprehensive overview of the Sony Linkbuds.Design and Comfort:The Sony Linkbuds continue to offer excellent comfort, allowing me to wear them for extended periods without any discomfort. The open-ear design serves its purpose flawlessly, enabling easy communication while wearing gloves. Although not suitable for everyone, those in search of this specific feature will appreciate the design. The fit remains secure, ensuring a hassle-free listening experience during media consumption, music playback, and video calls.Sound Quality and Performance:The sound quality of the Sony Linkbuds continues to impress in every aspect. Whether I'm enjoying music, watching videos, or engaging in phone calls, the audio output is consistently remarkable. The balanced sound signature ensures a pleasing experience, with rich bass, clear mids, and vibrant highs. However, it is important to note that the performance of the built-in microphone may be affected in windy or noisy environments, resulting in reduced clarity during calls.Battery Life and Connectivity:Over the past year, the battery life of the Sony Linkbuds has remained reliable. On average, I consistently achieve around 6 hours of playback time before receiving a low battery notification. This duration allows for extended usage without worrying about frequent recharging.

5,A year later and I’d add a star if I could.,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R9A540R81MDEU?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,,"Reviewed in Canada on March 30, 2022",2022-03-30,Canada,,"One year on and these buds are incredible. Everything I said before still applies. In fact I’m seriously considering buying another pair to keep in a drawer just in case I lose one or both of these.Here’s my original review:I was nervous about buying these. I'd tried open earbuds made by the other guys and while the sound was great, the design was awful. They hurt my ears, were impossible to wear with glasses and made every workout painful. I'd tried bone conduction headphones, but the cheap ones sounded awful and the most expensive set made my entire head vibrate if you turned the volume up even slightly. The sound was also quite muffled.So would it be third time lucky? I read the reviews and the fact that some people complained about the lack of bass with the Sony Linkbuds made me even more nervous. But when they arrived, I literally could not believe my ears.These buds sound absolutely amazing. There's plenty bass for me, and the sound is clear. I don't know how to explain this other than to say that it sounds ""clean"". Every note is crystal clear. I actually want to work out more often because my music sounds so good.Also, the wide area tap is terrific. It works instantly. With all my old wireless earphones, there's been a slight delay when skipping to the next song. It's never bothered me, but with the Linkbuds, you tap three times and your new song starts instantly. That's so much better.They also stay in my ears perfectly, even when I stand up on the bike and push hard. I've done a 2 hour indoor ride and they were comfortable throughout. No irritation, no itching, no pain. In fact, it's easy to forget that you're even wearing them, and not listening to your music out loud.Thank you Sony! You really did get these right.",True,Colour Name: White,[],3,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1336,230,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony Linkbuds original
5,Best in class in a very specific niche.,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R33GCOYU91ZVCJ?ASIN=B09QNLR4GD,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on August 1, 2022",2022-08-01,Canada,,"Basically, are you already someone who uses your earbuds in transparency mode 70%+ of the time? If so, get Linkbuds.My shipment got lost, so I got a refund (no hassle!) and then bought them at a brick an mortar store in March 2022. But apparently I still get to review these, so here we go.My coworkers have a surprisingly large vocal range, and the transparency mode on the Galaxy Buds+ I used previously just randomly wouldn't pick up some of my coworkers. I was already listening to music at work with transparency mode enabled 100% of the time, so switching to the Linkbuds was a zero friction changeover. It's not perfectly transparent - sound is very slightly muffled - but it's way more range accurate and won't randomly mute or amplify things.On the other hand, if you try to use while walking downtown at rush hour, or on a moving train or something, they'll be completely overpowered by the ambient noise and you'll barely be able to hear anything, even if you crank the volume. They'll still manage if you're standing in line at a store, which isn't amazing but again you're buying these so you can eventually hear the cashier when you're next.Default flat EQ is awful, and the presets are also pretty bad. I've attached my preferred EQ, which is pretty different from the current top review, so maybe that'll help someone else out. I'm not an audiophile, but this seems to work for me as, ""I can hear everything in a track while sitting in a quiet room without anything sounding overpowering or distorted.""Battery life vs. Buds+ with transparency constantly enabled...is still noticeably worse. 5-5.5 hrs is spot on, so you'll need to find time to throw these back into their case for a few minutes during a typical 8-hour shift. Having said that, Buds+ with constant transparency was just barely crapping out around the end of my shift, so I had to find time to charge those anyways.Fitting these in your ear has a learning curve. Essentially, put the donut in your ear canal, then push the plastic bits downwards until they stop (at the bottom of your concha). The correct adjustment hoop should just barely provide a third point of pressure once you've done this, and then it should stay in place. I have noticed that wide yawning can dislodge the buds, though.",True,Colour Name: Gray,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516mkLtG8uL._SY88.jpg'],4,B09QNLR4GD,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09QNLR4GD?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09QNLR4GD&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,1336,230,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 178, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony Linkbuds original

Ideally for use during running or hiking. I tried the Shokz Openmove Pro which were a decent option but the sound quality was clearly a compromise. They sounded tinny and anemic which was clearly a trade off for not having earbuds stuffed in your ears and allowing sound in.Enter the Sony linkbuds. These are infinitely better for the same use and application plus the sound quality is competitive with actual in-ear earbuds in the comparable price range. The ear canal is left open so external sound is still audible but music is layered on top so you are not devoid of activity in your immediate surroundings. My only real gripe are these are so incredibly light so they may feel a bit cheap? The case is also extremely small and bare bones and lacks the quality you would expect from something more weighted and substantial. On the contrary this could be seen as a testament to how much thought and development went into these to streamline the design and omit anything not crucial to performance.

I think perhaps it's because I have smaller ears than who these were designed for, which is very unfortunate as these buds tick every other box aside from comfort.While not a deal-breaker for me personally as I use these mostly for voice calls, I had to disable the tap features as my hair kept accidentally triggering it somehow (I have long hair that covers my ears). I didn't test this too much, but it was annoying to hear random beeping from having the tap feature triggered.If your ears are on the smaller side or have long hair that you don't like to tie up, I would not recommend this product unless you are able to try it on and test beforehand.

Of course, the advertisement is technically not wrong if you start off with fully charged earbuds that will last 7 hours, but it misleads you to think the case adds another 20 hours, which is not true.Sound quality:There's a lot of bass.The sound quality is good, which is all I can say. Obviously an open-back headphone like the SHP9500 sounds a lot better, but it doesn't sound bad. In fact, I like the sound quality better than the bose qc35ii.  It's a lot better than any wireless earbud or earphone you can buy for under 50 dollars, that I can say for sure. (However, there are wired iems under 50 that sound better).Also, I've noticed there's like a 1/4th second sound output delay, which feels awkward. So it's not ideal for playing games.Bluetooth connectivity:The Bluetooth is the best out of any Bluetooth device I've used. For example, Sennheiser 4.50btnc, bose qc 35ii, TWS earbuds. Pretty much, if you are within 2 meters of the device, even if you are in a very crowded space, it won't disconnect. It will briefly disconnect maybe once or twice over a span of 5 hours, which is very acceptable. In a less crowded space, it will remain connected within 8 meters. In your house, if no one else is using Bluetooth, you can pretty much walk anywhere while connected. Unlike the bose qc 35ii and Sennheiser 4.50btnc which start disconnecting as soon as I walk out of the room.ANC:The ANC is worse than the bose headphones, and I believe comparable to the airpods pro. It will completely cancel out any air conditioning noise. It will partially cancel out car engine noises, but will not cancel out any car horns.Comfort:If 10/10 is you feel nothing in your ears, it's probably around a 5/10.If 7/10 is you wearing foam earplugs, it's around a 9/10.Transparency mode:7/10. It does not sound realistic, but it does what it's supposed to do. However, that's not the reason I gave it a 7/10. The problem is you will hear wind noise blasting when you are just walking around in still air.Touch controls:I don't know why they made triple tap to go to a previous song, why not just make double tap the right earbud to skip forward and double tap the left earbud to go back?I've gotten somewhat used to the touch controls now, and it does what I want it to do 95% of the time. There are some occurrences where I try to turn up or down the volume and it ends up pausing/turning off ANC. But I believe with enough practice, that won't happen.Overall, I would give this at least 4 stars, but I didn't like the way they advertised the battery for the case, so I'm giving it 3 to discourage them from doing that.Update: Oh my goodness. I just tried 80+% volume for the first time and it's horrible. A whole bunch of static noises. (I'm listening to Viva la vida) I am going to return this.

Sadly however these earbuds are plagued a whole bunch of issues I believe are software related but almost never get fixed. For starters the earbuds discharge unevenly causing one earbud to have less battery than the other and apparently it's a common issue with these buds. The other glaring issue is that one earbud stops working (usually the right one for me) when making phone calls especially on Whatsapp. I found that other owners also have the same issues and people have submitted tickets directly to Google hoping for a fix but nothing has been made of it yet. One other thing is the call quality/microphone quality (for the person on the other end) is very bad so much so that they can't quite hear me well so I have to disconnect buds and just use the phone. The audio/sound quality is pretty damn good with a nice balance and nice base. The noise cancellation works pretty well too but I wish the ambient mode was better at detecting voices and amplifying it seeing as how good Google is with voice detection.

Overall, I love these headphones but there are some (small?) things that annoy me.Pros:- The sound quality is amazing. I've tried several wired and wireless headphones and  there are right up there in terms of sound quality. The base is punchy and there is very little distortion. Other similarly styled headphones that go in the ear tend to seal against the surface of the inner ear which, at least in my case, made it so that I could hear my heartbeat over whatever I was listening to.- The battery life is also great. Much much better than the headphones the buds pro replaced, and seemingly better than other premium brands that my friends have purchased.- The brand and the app are ""trusted"". At least they are more trusted than other brands out there. Most wireless headphones require that an app be installed. Some of those apps ask for permissions to access things like your financial info and demographics that in my mind, a headphone app should not be asking for.- The buds come with two additional pairs of silicone ear pieces that let you get the perfect fit.- Pairing was a breeze. I have a Samsung S22 Ultra and as soon as I opened the case, a message popped up on my phone to start the pairing process (which took about 2 minutes to complete).Cons:- The headphones aren't as loud as others I have tried. While noise cancelation does a good job of filtering out the noise so that you can hear your music clearly, the volume could be louder.- The app is fairly rudimentary. There is no EQ function (yet) so you can't tweak the sound to your preference.- The headphones do wiggle themselves loose at times.

4,"""Pro"" Features, Amateur Design | *Updated",,12 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2023",2023-11-03,United States,,"Update: I took these out to one of the many circles of heck known as “Mid-Morning Grocery Shopping on a Sunday” (meaning, it's far too busy, and crowded for comfort). I have to say, the experience was much better than that of the AirPods Pro (APP). When I walked, I never got that low “thump” in my ears like with the APP, they felt secure, and I didn't need to adjust them after initially inserting them. The best part? Zero pain/pressure after removing them.Using these with a Pixel 8 Pro. The case is very nice and has a matte finish, so it should hide micro-scratches better than the AirPods cases. USB-C, plus wireless charging (Qi).The earbuds themselves are small, and round. This makes them a little difficult to remove from the case, and hold with 2 fingers securely. Inserting the earbuds is equally challenging, since there is no wing to brace against your ear's Concha (The wing exists on the cheaper Pixel Buds A, but not the “Pro” for some reason). Therefore, the earbud might be rotated at an angle that blocks part of a microphone. In my initial testing, I didn't notice this affect the Active Noise Cancelling (ANC).I have tiny ear canals, and therefor need special ear-tips that are smaller than “Small”. Thankfully, my favorite tip maker, Spinfit sells a kit that allows me to use size SS tips (seen in my photos). CP1025 with CPA2 is the kit if anyone wants to try them. Spinfit are the only after-market tips I use on all my IEMs. Well worth the price.The version out of the box for the case, and buds was 1.5. If you happen to read this, do yourself a favor and update the firmware ASAP. Now on version 5.9 (I think), and not only does the default tuning sound better, they added numerous new features, including a customizable EQ*.Going back to the shape, the side of the earbuds (where the color is, and the “G” logo) is one big touch-surface. This is the only method to control the sound when your phone/source is unreachable. This is active as soon as the buds are out of the case, and connected. Inserting them in a secure position will cause your media to play, pause, skip a track or two, call the Assistant, raise/lower the volume. So when you finally have them inserted, it's a gamble as to what will be playing at what volume.They sound good with the new firmware, and can be used for all kinds of music. You might not get the Honda Civic trunk-shaking bass you want, but that is where the EQ comes in. Turn up the “Low bass” slider, and you'll hear it. Max out the bass, and low bass sliders, and you'll get a similar tuning to Raycons if that's your thing (Don't buy Raycons). The ANC is nice. Not thrilling, but nice. I've been spoiled by Sony's ANC. I'd imagine these would work on a commercial plane to drown out the cabin rumble enough to listen to music at a reasonable level. The transparency mode is usable, but doesn't come anywhere close to Apple's version, where it sounds 99% natural. This can always be fixed with firmware updates.I still need some more time with these to decide whether the weird fit is something I can live with or not.*The EQ is very user-friendly, but a little maddening for anyone who uses a multi-band equalizer. None of the frequencies are labeled. Instead, they opt for “friendly” names. Upper Treble, Treble, Mid, Bass, and Low Bass. It's hard to get a good EQ with these options, since I know what frequencies I normally add/subtract to. I'm not sure if the friendly names are a single frequency, or a group. I have a feeling they are a group of frequencies, since “Mid” can consist of 8 or more bands, and bass is usually 4–6 bands. It's better than nothing, though, and shockingly, these buds can do a little sub-bass.",True,Colour Name: Charcoal,[],10,B0B1N7SGMZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B1N7SGMZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B1N7SGMZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,379,90,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 179, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Pixel Buds Pro

2,NOT for music - poor sound quality and then some,,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2023",2023-02-17,United States,,"Do you like high-quality sound ? Then do NOT buy these- they make music sound very muddy and muffled. Maybe if you're used to blasting tunes through the smartphone speakers, this could be considered an upgrade in quality, but otherwise no. I ended up returning these and buying Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro and the difference in sound quality couldn't be any more drastic- even without using LDAC codec (pixel buds Pro only support AAC- more on that later).  It was like going from FM radio to a CD. Anyway, this isn't a review of Anker, so moving on...Overall, pixel buds Pro are a massive letdown with half baked design/engineering, and worst of all- VERY poor sound quality. A beta product at best (at least some consistency here from Google and its Beta Universe of Beta Everything). If you're mainly using them for zoom or voice calls, listening to podcasts, etc they might do the trick, but so will a $50 set of buds. But if you intend to use them for listening to music, they simply don't deliver- certainly not for a hefty $150-200 price tag.No amount of EQ tweaking could bring any quality/clarity to the music, albeit the available EQ settings are very rudimentary- just the 5 fixed frequency ""sliders"" (but without actual frequencies/Hz even being indicated) plus a handful of presets.The EQ and other controls worked very well on a Pixel phone as did the Bluetooth pairing- a really slick pairing experience, actually. However, when I tried installing the Pixel Buds app on a NON-Pixel Android 13 phone, it didn't show any of the controls (the app basically didn't work), so YMMV on any device that's not a Google's own phone.The other downside to the app is the very limited configuration options and settings for customizing the touch controls- can not adjust touch sensitivity or just simply disable the touch function (the buds constantly register ""touch"" when they're merely being adjusted and perform random actions as a result).After a couple of days playing with these, I noticed the buds' batteries will drain from just sitting. There is no way to actually turn them off other than by returning into the charging case and closing it (triple tap no longer works). Seriously, Google- a $200 headphone set that is too dumb to not turn itself off when not in use! Or is it too ""Apple"" for you to actually have the buds turn off automatically when they're removed from one's ears, especially considering that all necessary sensors and HW are already there anyway and the headphones ""know"" when they're inserted and removed? At least offer a configurable sleep timer/power save mode- like virtually every gadget on the planet has.Speaking of Apples, while the buds- ostensibly designed for Pixel and Android phones- support Apple's (defacto) AAC codec of all things(!), they lack support for any higher quality codecs, such as Qualcomm Apt-x, Aptx-LL, or Sony's LDAC. If I wanted headphones that are ""married"" to Apple and its AAC, I might've as well bought Airpods Pro or Bose...As there is no way to adjust touch sensitivity or disable the touch function, the buds end up doing random things (play, skip, toggling ANC) while I'm simply adjusting them for better fit. Perhaps on/off functionality would be helpful here too, so that I may first adjust the fit before actually turning them on. And seeing how they automatically turn on when removed from the case, this becomes yet another source of battery drain, should I for whatever reason just put them aside. To avoid battery drain they must be returned to the case every time- no alternatives here. Seems like Apple's ""philosophy"", i.e. ""we've already decided what's best for you and how you should use your device, so we won't give you any options"". Again, if I wanted the vendor dictate how I use my devices, I might as well buy Apple products... Don't we all use Google/Android products because they allow(ed) flexibility instead of forcing the user into doing  things as the vendor decided is the ""best"" (and the only) way ?Fit- while this is subjective, I could never get them to fit securely, despite trying different size ear tips (hence the need for adjustments which wreaked havoc with the touch interface). The buds always felt somewhat loose, albeit that loose fit made them comfortable to wear for hours without any strain or pressure on the ears- guess this is the silver lining. But forget trying to run or exercise in these. The lack of wingtips is probably the biggest issue with the design to ensure a secure fit.The only other thing I liked about these buds besides their ""loose-fitting"" wearing comfort is the ANC- it did a very good job drowning out the sound of rushing water and other background noises. So they get 1 star for comfort and one star for ANC.",True,Colour Name: Charcoal,[],7,B0B1N7SGMZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B1N7SGMZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B1N7SGMZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,82,55,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 179, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Pixel Buds Pro

I wouldn’t recommend them at this price, $100 would be solid even $115 but nothing more, it’s so many other options that don’t have this problem, I find myself just turning Bluetooth off on my phone so I know it won’t connect. I’ve had them for over a year and they’ve had the issue the entire time, I dealt with it hoping google correct the issue with an update but no…. They haven’t fixed anything, as a super fan this is disappointing, I find myself feeling like google doesn’t care and I shouldn’t be spending my money on half baked products. If this issue wasn’t a thing I would give it 4.5, the other issue is they fall out, I know that’s a personal issue but I’ve never had buds that fell out this often ( look into better tips) I would avoid getting them at $200 , not worth that price.",True,Colour Name: Charcoal,[],8,B0B1N7SGMZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B1N7SGMZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B1N7SGMZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,82,55,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 179, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Pixel Buds Pro
2,Nothing but trouble,,2 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2023",2023-11-09,United States,,"These headphones are just ridiculously finicky, even when using them with a Pixel phone. In no particular order:- The in-ear detection is inconsistent and sometimes requires reinsertion or even replacing them into the case to ""reset"" them- When taking one out it switches the other to transparency mode, but when the in-ear detection fails when putting it back in, it remains in standard mode which is fairly disorienting- Switching between two devices is inconsistent and doesn't work half the time, sometimes requiring them to be reset in the case before a device will actually play through them- The touch sensor doesn't turn off when not in my ear, so it sometimes ends up playing/pausing or skipping tracks while it's in my pocket- The volume gestures are sometimes inconsistent which is especially frustrating when the volume increases to be way too loud when trying to turn it down- They have a fairly large profile and aren't particularly comfortable, especially when laying down on a pillow- The case is quite large and takes up a lot of space in my pocket- They let a lot of outside noise through when not in transparency mode- Transparency mode doesn't sound particularly good and is a little disorienting- It took a lot of finagling to get them to update to the latest firmware (the factory firmware was about a year out of date)The sound quality is at least alright, but it's nothing special and about on par with my Galaxy Buds+. The range is a solid pro and they keep a strong connection to my phone basically anywhere in my apartment. The volume gestures are also nice (when they work correctly) since they allow volume up and down with a single bud. Overall though, at this price point I would recommend just getting a pair of Galaxy Buds (or really anything else).",True,Colour Name: Charcoal,[],9,B0B1N7SGMZ,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B1N7SGMZ?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0B1N7SGMZ&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,82,55,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 179, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Pixel Buds Pro

5,For $149.00? Get two pair!,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R303EPNB7FZ57O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,131 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on April 30, 2022",2022-04-30,Canada,,"First of all, I'm an audiophile and a technophile.I've spent 40 years in consumer electronics, so I'd consider myself as someone who is approaching expert level.Secondly, I've a headphone addiction. I don't want to add up what I've spent on headphones this year, or any year, for that matter.I own them all, value brands (under $50.00) mid-range $100-$200 and higher end, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, etc.I particularly like headphones that punch above their weight class. In other words, these $150.00 headphones can compete with their Sony and Bose competitors that sell for almost twice as much money.I evaluate headphones using the following criteria:1. Ease of pairing.2. Fit and comfort. How long can I comfortably wear these headphones?3. Accessories. I like a good selection of different sized ear tips and wings to secure a good fit.4. Battery life and the size of the charging case.5. Packaging and unboxing. A company that gives me a good experience opening the packaging usually means a quality device.6. Device build. Does it feel cheap? Or, does it use quality materials?7. Sound quality (most important!) I evaluate sound quality on the following factors: Bass response. Is it clear and tight? Is it boomy and muddy? Midrange response. Good midrange means better vocal sound quality. Treble response. As males age, we lose our ability to hear higher frequencies or midrange. Good treble allows the listener to hear cymbals clearly.All right, let's go.Ease of pairing. You can do two things. The first time you use these headphones, they go into pairing mode. Using your device's Bluetooth settings, pair them up and they are ready to go. OR, download the Soundcore app from your respective app store and install it. Using the app, it will detect your Pro 3's and start the setup process. After a quick firmware update, I continued the setup. The app has a HearID procedure that tests your hearing, using different frequencies to see if you can hear them. It then tunes the headphones to your individual hearing abilities for each ear. You can also download an LDAC codec if you use a hi-res streaming service like Tidal, Qobuz or Amazon Music HD (I've got them all.) Apple Music finally supports lossless audio but if you're using an iOS device? It doesn't support lossless audio, even with their Airpod Pro model. Full disclosure: I don't like Apple products, other than my iPad for Facetime. Once you use the app and go through the setup? That's where these models shine. I was startled at how good they sounded.Fit and comfort: I've been wearing these headphones for almost 4 hours and I'm not noticing any significant discomfort. I suspect 6 hours will be my limit and I'll have to take them out of my ears for a break. As all of our ears are different? Your mileage may vary. Choosing the right tip and wing is vital.Accessories: It's an efficient setup with a good selection of tips and wings for most users. The charging case is smaller than the previous model which is nice.Battery life: I always recommend charging before 1st use. After 4 hours, I'm still at 65% battery remaining with ANC on. They claim up to 32 hours, with a full charge on the case. Depending on what level of ANC you use and listening volume, your mileage may vary. I suspect that their claims are pretty accurate.Packaging and unboxing: Efficiently excellent. They come in a 6"" by 6"" square box. It opens like a book, with quick start guide on inside left. The eartips and wings are in the ""spine"" of the packaging, followed by the headphones in their charging case and a USB C (nice!) charging cable.Device build: Excellent. I was impressed with copper color of the ""speakers"" (where you install the ear tips) I bought the black model. They have a nice matte finish with a grey/silver casing.Sound quality: (Finally!) Overall, they are excellent and they definitely punch above their weight class. The bass response is tight with the tiniest bit of boominess or muddy sound. I suspect a proper break in or changing the wings or eartips will solve reduce this. The midrange and vocals are impressive to excellent. Vocals are very clear and maybe a tad ""bright"". The treble is excellent. The highhat cymbal is damn near perfect. The stereo imaging and soundstage is EXCELLENT. You can place the instruments in the room. The depth of sound is excellent as well. You can hear the drummer behind the singer and guitar player to left and right. I used Tidal in Hi Res and used the headphones set up in LDAC mode.I use three songs to evaluate my headphones.Wicked As It Seems from Keith Richards excellent Main Offender album (2022 remaster) Keef records in analog and live in the studio. It keeps the ""air"" in the music and doesn't reduce the imaging quality.Barbie Dreams by Nicki Minaj. I really am not a fan of rap or modern R/B music. I just listen it to evaluate bass response. This track is where I noticed the slight ""boom"" in the bass. These tracks are basically made and mixed in a computer. No air in them. If you like this type of music, these headphones are satisfying.One by U2 (Mary Blige/U2 duet) This where the vocals and imaging shine. You can hear the subtlety in the Edge's guitar playing. The drums and bass are right where they need to be. You can hear the scratchiness in Bono's vocals and the sheer perfection of Mary's vocal range.I'll probably move on to some Fleetwood Mac, Phil Collins, and the Rolling Stones for further evaluation. I also like Adele and Imelda May. I expect I'll have the same experience as my 3 reference tracks.  After I do some more varied listening, I'll adjust my rating(s) if necessary.My review is really 4.5 stars. They are not quite a 5 but definitely deserve more than 4 stars.If you're eying Sony XM1004 or Bose Soundsport or Sennheiser equivalents but are struggling with spending $300+? Grab these Liberty 3 Pro headphones. Yes, the Sony and Sennheiser will sound better but not twice as good as these Pro models at half the price.If you're looking at dipping your toes in hi-res music and want a starting point? You can't go wrong with these Liberty 3 Pro headphones. I heartily recommend you use the Soundcore app and take the time to do the firmware updates and do the HearID to match these headphones to your ears and hearing abilities.If you've read this far?

5,Another great Soundcore product,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R3HHBJP7A29VEO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,7 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on May 2, 2023",2023-05-02,Canada,,"Since most people don't read entire reviews, I'd better get it out of the way.These are incredible for the price. I listen to dnb, edm, and metal and these are fantastic. Multipoint works perfectly despite what a few others here have said (update firmware?). I use these all day at work with my Windows laptop and my ZFold 4. Install the Soundcore app, pair them to the phone, then turn on ""Dual Device Connection"" to enable multipoint. Finally, pair them with the laptop. Works exactly like it should.Now, on the to the rest. I also have the Liberty Air 2 that I bought a few years ago. Another great value for sound quality, but unfortunately as it goes with earbuds they simply weren't a suitable work device for me as they were constantly falling out when I walked, talked, chewed or even thought about them and had no ANC so keyboard mashing was horrible on the receiving end. Switched back the good old reliable Apple wired earbuds but the cable broke despite them never leaving the desk. I moved on to some much cheaper buds (Lenovo True Wireless Earbuds) for my work calls and meetings. They stayed put but had the worst connection consistency I've ever seen in a bluetooth device, awful quality control (the right earbud broke in 2 pairs almost instantly), about 3 hours of battery life, and Windows hated them (meeting apps would recognize the mic but would often just ignore them as a playback device) and rather than going insane I decided to move on.So here we are. Decided I wanted something better, and spent far too many hours watching reviews of the Liberty 3 Pro and the Sennheiser and Sony comparables. Look, I'm sure the Sennheiser and Sony sound nice too, but these are just SO good for the price it's almost impossible to justify the others costing twice what these do. If you've read this far you probably realize this review is actually just mostly me complaining about OTHER earbuds so here's the thing... I have nothing bad to say about these, they really are a fantastic deal (currently $150 CAD after sale+coupon). The ANC is excellent, mic quality is more than good enough for work meetings, they come with ton of tips and wings so even I who have had the worst time finding comfortable and secure earbuds have been able to get a perfect fit, battery life is great, the charging pod is about as flat as it can possibly be so very easy to pocket, sound is excellent, great customization in the app for EQ and touch controls (you can even set different controls when using both vs when using a single earbud), and multipoint works great.Anker is really doing a great job in this space",True,Colour Name: Midnight Black,[],2,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,6061,1686,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 159.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

But I needed 6 controls: play/pause, ANC on/off, volume up, volume down, track forward, track reverse. I could only choose 4. I contacted Anker through their email to see if they would implement the 6 controls perhaps through a firmware upgrade. Their service people were very nice. But their response  was that no firmware upgrade. But they may implement this in subsequent products. Ultimately the deal breaker was the poor Call quality. People on the other end of the phone call could not hear me talking at all. Perhaps it was just that pair. They were return shortly after.I do have the Sony MX-1000MR3 among others. They are the best by far. Unfortunately, they are top heavy and could not stay in my ears for long. They can stay in my ears for no more than 5 minutes. They just keep falling off or I have to constantly adjust them.I have the Jaybird Vista 2, winged, but they had no ANC. The passive noise blocking makes it worse. I could hear my own breathing and heart thumps.I tried a few different brands and finally settled for the Jabra Elite 85t. They fit well and stay in my ears even without the wings. But they don't survive some moderate exercise like pushups.So I searched some more and came across many rave reviws about the Soundcore Space A40. But they are not winged. Then I found this Anker Liberty 3 Pro that have everyting I wanted. After much research, I finally decided on them. Now I have them for 2 weeks. I am not disappointed. They are light weight, have as good sound and ANC as my Sony's if not better. Their wings keep them secure in my ears even after 100 pushups and survive moderate aerobic exercise. I have yet tried to run with them. They have the controls. They cost a little more than the Space A40 but way cheaper than the Sony's. They are good value.

5,Fantastic sound.

Vocal is great. Good for podcasts. Very clear.This all is great, when you can keep these in place properly. I have had a couple other cheaper brand eabuds that fit my ear canal better and don't want to eventually fall out. I have tried all their 4 silicone ear pieces, as well at the wings, but cannot get the best fit. Sure, might be my canals, but if you get warm, the silicone tips get slippery and with the weight of the earbud itself, it wants to slide out of the best position and almost come out. The tips are made of a good quality material, this is not an issue, just the combo of weighty earbuds with big batteries + gravity cause them to move out of position a bunch.Batteries:Great. 4.5-5 hrs per charge. I almost exclusively use only one ear bud at a time and love the fact that the battery runs out but I can just pop the other in.Once in a while, you need to pay attention to how the ear buds magnetically clip in. You can feel it click in, but it doesn't sit exactly on the charging pins. Doesn't happen very often, but you can see the lights inside the case under each ear bud light up to notify it is now charging. Handy.Multipoint:Very useful when using 2 phones. Connect through bluetooth and you can hear calls from either phone.Whichever phone/listening device last connected is the one sending notifications to the buds. You can hear all your customized dings and beeps, even when on a call.Sometimes, the ear buds do have a hard time recognizing which phone is the last used. Have had many times where I hit the pause function, talk to someone or listen to something outside the earbud, hit the play function and it doesn't play. Sometimes it takes a minute to register, sometimes the other phone's spotify starts playing.Functions:Finger touching works very well. Work with light gloves on and it registers with them.The ability to change the times you touch the buds for each function is great. In the app, you can change each ear buds functions individually, which is extremely handy.You can do the ear bud canal profile set up when first getting the ear buds. This is nice. Does help a bit.Transparency mode works well enough. A slight static-y sound at first, but you don't even notice it after a few minutes. Can hear  at a slightly lower volume than without.Eartips, when secured in place, are a great noise reduction by themselves. I barely use the noise cancelling.Volume level is great. These can get really loud for both calls and music.Call quality:Call quality is great. Voice is picked up from either ear bud well, even in a noisy environment. Last ear buds were terrible in a shop area with loud machinery, these have no issue with my voice coming through clear and loud enough.Earbud weight:Heavy end of buds out there. Have a tendancy to cause ear fatigue when wearing them all day.If I had the choice, I would buy these again. The only downfall is the weight and how far they stick out of the ear.Love the sound.Call quality/reception is top notch.Hope this helps a little",True,Colour Name: Midnight Black,[],4,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful,6061,1686,fiveStar,"{'price': {'value': 159.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

Rings can be a pain to set properly on the buds but once you got the good ones on you’re set. Initially I was feeling that no combination was giving me a good seal. Then I realized the fit was so smooth and unobtrusive that you almost don’t feel you’re eating them. Those really don’t put pressure on the ear canal, leaving the impression they’re about to fall off but they’re stuck in there tight. They are a bit chunky but they hit a sweet spot of comfort for me.Soundcore app and HearID: personalized sound is a bit strong on the highs but you can always tune it manually to your liking. Audio test made me realize I don’t have the same hearing capacity in my right and left ear. Having each channel tuned to its ear makes a big difference as with other buds, I’m always pushing on the right side bud to make a better seal in order to have a balanced sound. EQ is average but does what it’s supposed to. Presets are gimmicky but you might find one you enjoy.ANC: Probably not the strongest  but works fine. On the positive side, I find it doesn’t cause much fatigue like others. I realize it was on once I turn it off and the urban jungle noise comes back.Transparency mode: it kinda sucks…very high pitched and un-natural. Don’t really need that anyways.Wind reduction feature: there is quite some delay for it to turn on and you need to turn your head in the wind direction for each bud to catch the wind. Don’t expect it to block a quick blow but it should work fine for a steady windy situation once both buds have activated.Phone calls : good on my end, had no complaints on the other end. Didn’t buy these for phone calls so I’ll take them as they come.Music, finally : once you set up the EQ to your liking, these are pretty damn good for the price. Don’t expect 500$ sound, don’t expect reference critical listening. But for casual music on the go, they are very enjoyable. They definitely have a sound signature and EQ can only do so much to compensate. They can get very loud but you can still have a good listening experience at moderate volume, witch I appreciate. Soundstage and detail isn’t on par with good old quality ear cans but  it’s surprising for such a small package and especially for 159$.The evil hiss : lots of people rant about these buds hissing. In my experience of steaming tracks from Spotify, I found some tracks hiss and some don’t.  With the hissing tracks, I switched to a few other buds and the hiss is still audible.  It’s more noticeable on the Liberties as they are very clear on the highs but I don’t find a particular hiss coming from the buds themselves.Overall, Anker makes a good “no-mame” style product. You’d pay a lot more to get the same features from big name brands. I’ve had positive experience with the Anker customer service in the past so I’m comfortable with my purchase in the long run.",True,Colour Name: Midnight Black,[],1,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,1656,561,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 159.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

And I find very frustrating to not be able to ear in ear phones before the purchase, making this purchase a leap $200 Cdn worth. And on top of these hesitations, I probably bought some 5 or 6 headphones before finding what I consider good sounding headphones. Not to mention that I can't afford $1,000 headphones.The criteria that lead me to these Soundcore ear-buds was the fact that they come with 4 different sizes of ear-buds cushions. I got several ear-buds that were part of some smart phone purchases and I never was able to fit them properly in my ears. Out of the (fancy) box, I pick the third size and these did the trick of correctly sealing the ear canal delivering an astonishing sound quality.I downloaded the app and began to fiddle with a lot of set-ups that at some point could be very confusing. There are more than “20 Sound Effects” setting which are actually EQ settings one can pick from. I tried all of them and was back to the default ""Soundcore setting"". Which was already beyond my expectations. All these setting were too much of bass, or lack of middle, or lack of presence...Then I notice that there is a LDAC setting available (that unfortunately Apple does not support). This isn’t an Eq setting, but that was the one setting. The surround effect isn't available with this codec but I didn't like those effects... Finally I finished with the personal EQ setting almost flat except for a very small dip in  the treble 12.8KHz (-1 on a range of ±6).The other nice thing (if you are patient to go through these settings) is that each of the two ear buds can be set to:Either raise or lower the volume,Pause / play,Next/ Previous song,depending of you Tap /Hold on  or /Maintain your finger on the right or left ear separately.Conclusion: As far as can I tell, these are in a class apart. I you buy these, you probably will get much more you bargain for. After a charge in their cradle and a software update they will already give you more than a good sound. If you have an hour or two to spend (and some patience) with the app, you should be able to get a very impressive sound.There are still some features (that have nothing to do with the sound quality) that I will have to fiddle with that with to explore. Like the ear sound test and ambient sound feed through, phone call handling...If sound quality is your first criteria, these are for you.Denis from Canada",True,Colour Name: Midnight Black,[],2,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,1656,561,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 159.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

I had problem with the Sonys, they would not stay in my ears very well and had a microphone feedback problem on the left earpiece. And it wasn't just a one-off defect either.Well, the Liberty 3 Pros stay in my ears pretty firmly, are lighter and comfortable enough to wear for an extended period of time, and also have a pretty decent sound, once configured right. I find that these articulate sound almost as well as the Sonys, but there is no microphone feedback. The noise cancellation is present and working, but it is very subtle and fairly toned down compared to the one on the Sonys. But then the Sonys overdid it and had the feedback problem as a result. ANC on around-the-ear headsets is a life saver and something I am looking for there, but in my experience earbuds are better off with just a very good ear canal seal. This is good enough to not interfere and still help somewhat.I love that the Soundcore app allowed me to reconfigure the buttons the way I want them, but that's about it. Other than this none of the features there to ""improve"" the sound quite work right. The 3D sound mode makes my favourite artists sound like they are singing in the shower, and also boost the highs to the point the headphones begin to distort. This feature is not meaningful without some controls there. The HearID just cranked all but 2 bands to max for some reason and thus failed to produce a measurable result. Wasn't this just supposed to boost the bands my ears are not as sensitive to? Also none of the equalizer presets quite seem to balance the sound correctly: either too much or too little. Eventually I took over the equalizer myself and now I can enjoy some really nice balanced music with deep lows, articulated highs, and mids that don't overwhelm. I don't think I would be using it much beyond the initial setup. Come ooooon, Anker, do it right!I hate touch controls: they trigger when they shouldn't, do things I never intended to, usually at most unfortunate times when I can't fix them immediately. These have a big flat area so the problems are somewhat less than usual, but I still prefer Anker would just put physical buttons there.

One reviewer even say 3Pro is better than Sony WF-1000XM4 in terms of ANC?!!?....some say it's soooo good it blocks out vacuum and lawn mower...etc. I didn't trust them completely but those videos still gave me high hopes on the 3Pro ANC performance.....and unfortunately my expectations were not met...The sound quality is indeed very good.... might be the best in this class.

These earbuds are by no means bad, but I have had a lot of issues surrounding the fit of the earbud in particular.

I occasionally have the sound completely drop off for a few seconds before coming back. It is different than a pause/play. The audio will get quieter, become distorted, stop, and then return. I have never had this problem with any of my other Bluetooth devices.Occasionally, when I put my earbuds in their case, they stay connected to my phone, significantly draining their battery overnight.My last gripe is the design of the case.

They fit me well, the sound is excellent and the quality of the build: awesome. I had expected to use them for a long time.I used them mostly at home at not all that much as I have 2 other Soundcore buds: Life Dot 2 NC for working out and a set of Liberty Air 2 that I use for work and other calls as the mics are incredible.I've been putting up with the dreaded 90% charge: they won't charge to 100% plus, the right bud sporadically won't charge while left in the case. Instead of charging, the battery drains down to almost nothing in the right bud. And I don't find this out until I go to use it.Unfortunealy, the warranty is over and although they've not been used much, they're no longer useable.I like the other soundcore buds I have and the Motion Boom as well ( best small portable player I've ever owned ) so much that I'm going to buy the Space A40 buds and hope for the best with them.I have other IE buds and a Sony WH1000-MX3 currently. I've gone through mid-priced headphones and buds and have either accepted that the sound is okay, like SkullCandy for working out at the gym. Or, great ANC and sound like the Sony's but uncomfortable after an hour or so due to the too-soft padding on the ear cups, for my head anyway.Let me say, those YouTube videos saying how great the Liberty Pro 3's are...are absolutely right.  I am blown away with how fantastic they sound for me!I like strong, detailed bass. Even in rock or metal, I want to hear the kick drums rumble, the bass lines clear and strong.  The Sony's did that for me and the Soundcore's don't have the sound that the bigger drivers of the over-ears.But the sound is so close: the bass is defined and present: I can almost feel it! And at first the highs were a bit too much for my liking but just as on my other Soundcore IE's, the app allows me to tune / EQ any way that I want to.And, I can wear them for hours with no discomfort: they're that good.

2,Soundstage is extremely disappointing.,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R3SNW0KEVDXEB8?ASIN=B09CGM1BWH,8 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on January 5, 2022",2022-01-05,Canada,,"I will start by saying I did not buy these from watching influencers hype them up. I bought them because I thought the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro's had potential and wanted to see if the 3 Pro's were the ""home run"" upgrade I was hoping they would be.To sum it up shortly, they were not an upgrade. If anything, they were a big downgrade.The first thing I noticed when using these is that the soundstage is horribly small.Imagine the speakers in a movie theater. Nice and immersive, right? Then compare them to one of those mini Bluetooth speakers you can fit in your pocket.When you use the Liberty 3 Pro's, it sounds like you're listening to that mini Bluetooth speaker and the soundstage is tiny and not immersive whatsoever. If you have any experience with mid-range headphones, or even just better wireless earbuds, then you'll absolutely hate how tiny the soundstage sounds.Very disappointing and the Liberty 2 Pro's had a better soundstage by far.The second thing I noticed was that there's always white noise in the background when you're not playing any music. The Liberty 2 Pro's had the same problem with constant background white noise (they reduced it with firmware updates, but could never totally get rid of it), so it seems that they couldn't figure out what was causing it and fix it for the Liberty 3 Pro's.Again, pretty disappointing.The noise cancelling is decent, but it's just ""decent"". If you have any experience with the noise cancelling kings like the Sony WF-1000XM4 and Apple Airpods Pro, then these will not impress you whatsoever.The audio is fine aside from the tiny soundstage. They emphasize the bass and treble a lot, but you can EQ the audio from the app so that's not a problem as long as you can ignore the tiny soundstage.I like the fact that you can fully customize single/double/triple press and long press for the touch controls on both earbuds. This is the one thing about Soundcore which I really appreciate.I like the earbud case and how it slides open because it's cool, but the magnet holding the earbuds appears to be too weak because the earbuds sometimes don't snap into place properly (causing them to not charge properly). I saw a review mention this and thought they were overexaggerating, but the magnets really do seem too weak.For reference, I didn't have this problem with the Liberty 2 Pro's charging case.ConclusionIn my opinion, anyone who wants to give Soundcore a try should probably get the Liberty 2 Pro instead of the Liberty 3 Pro. Even then, I would recommend anyone who sees this review to look around at other companies instead.If you're here for the noise cancelling, I recommend the Sony WF-1000XM4's for Android users and the Apple Airpod Pros for Apple users.If you're here for high quality audio, unfortunately, it's personal preference so you really just have to try everything to know whether you like something or not.",True,Colour Name: Midnight Black,[],2,B09CGM1BWH,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09CGM1BWH?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09CGM1BWH&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,463,317,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 159.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Soundcore Liberty 3

Unfortunately, they have not met my expectations. I have been using them for a little over a month now. It really is a shame how many negatives I've experienced with these because I really do love how they sound. Below is a list of my pros and cons:Pros:-Sound great, have good volume, and I appreciate the ability to change the sound to your liking.-They fit and stay in my ear fairly well once I found the right combination of tip and wing.-ANC works decent. Definitely doesn't cancel out all noise but it does reduce outside noise quite a bit. About what I expected at this price point.-Transparency mode also works decent but don't expect to be able to hold a conversation with music playing unless it is at a low volume.Cons:-They aren't the most comfortable earbuds. Even with the proper tip and wing combo, it doesn't take long for them to irritate my ears. Also beware that if you wear too big of a fit, they may temporarily damage your ears. After trying to find my right fit, I had to wait about 2 days before I could wear them again because my ears hurt so badly.-No manual power off. This means that if you are changing your tips/wings or interacting with them in any way out of your ears, you keep triggering the functions.-Functions very often don't work properly or at all. The most common issue is that ANC or transparency mode will only turn on/off in one ear. Sometimes the functions will acknowledge your interaction but won't perform their function.-ANC and transparency mode will turn themselves on/off without any kind of interaction.-Connection issues happen at least once on most listening sessions.-Can be a bit difficult to get the earbuds to properly sit in their case to turn off and charge.-Earbuds will sometimes stay on and connected to your device after being placed in the case and indicating that they are properly seated.-They will sometimes randomly pause my media with no interaction.-Wing tips don't stay in place. As a result they fall out of your ears more easily and cover the in-ear sensor.In conclusion, while I do love the sound, I just can't get over the disappointment and frustration.

I ordered a new pair, thinking the first set was defective. And they were wrapped in plastic, whereas the previous box was not! So 100% the last set was USED and SOLD AS NEW! Very disappointing, Amazon!!I really wanted to like these. I've had other Anker products that were great, I loved the colour, and the reviews were pretty good.I've been using Galaxy Buds+ for a few years and while they're really consistent for connection, and pretty comfortable to wear, they don't have multi-pairing and the sound quality isn't great. Because they're the best I've found so far, that's my baseline.On the Pros side, they had decent sound quality and lots of fit options, so there's a better chance something will work for you. I like that they have multi-pairing, and a variety of options for optimal fit.Cons...I think I received a defective set. Even fresh off the charger, they read 90% charge from my laptop and phone. Also, the mic doesn't sound the same as the sound test I heard online from an independent reviews site, so maybe something's wrong with mine.The mic was ok on Zoom (recording test) in a silent room, as well as with a video playing subway sounds on a speaker nearby. Granted, Zoom does its own sound filtering, so that's more a test of Zoom's capabilities than the microphone's.When I tested the mic by recording a message in my voicemail system, the sound was ok in a quiet room but quickly got overwhelmed by the ambient noise test. In contrast, my Galaxy Buds+ were loud and clear and filtered out the background noise.If Zoom in a quiet room is all you need the microphone for, these will be fine.

Rich creamy bass and excellent noise cancellation. I could not hear my family talking in the same room as me with ANC turned on, nor any noises outside. Not sure how they would fare against power tools, but for my purposes it was stunning.Ultimately, I returned them, however. For 3 reasons:1. the earbuds had to be re-paired all of the time. I had them paired with my phone, computer, and tv. As long as I changed connection (or kept connected) to 2 devices, all was good. As soon as I connected to a third device, I had to re-do all of my pairings. SUPER ANNOYING.2. The earbuds do not power down when put in the case. Several times I would have the earbuds in the case and a phone call would come through. Answering the call, sent it to the earbuds in the case halfway across the house. SUPER ANNOYING.3. Placing the buds in the case was awkward. You do not simply pull the earbuds out of your ear and drop them into the case. Here is what you have to do: grasp the earbud (palm is facing you, thumb downward), take the earbud out, swivel your hand 180 degrees forward (palm is facing away from you, thumb is upward), then you can place the earbud in the case without any additional fumbling. SUPER ANNOYING.If you can live with those 3 problems, go ahead and buy them. As for me, the hunt for the best mid-price ear buds continues...

The Bluetooth multi-point connection barely works. The earbuds do not automatically reconnect. When they do connect, sound sources don't switch to the buds automatically - I often have to close and re-start whatever media I am playing. The single/dual earbud thing is also a problem because every time you open the case the earbuds connect to...something - even if you can't hear anything (see my first comment above). Another issue is that the music player will start randomly sometimes when I take the earbuds out of the case and put them in my ear. These buds need a setting to turn off resume media. A lot of these things are bluetooth 101 and the cheapest of earbuds (including other Ankers!) do all of this fairly seamlessly. $200 is waaaaaay too much for these buds - they fail at the most basic of tasks. Finally bit the bullet and ended up getting a refund.ORIGINAL REVIEWI really love the Anker brand and own several pairs - my current favourite being the Liberty Air 2 Wireless. I also believe in the brand enough to have gifted various pairs to friends and family. This is why it pains me to say their latest flagship Liberty 3's were a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong - all of the things you expect from $200 headphones work as they should: transparency mode, ANC, decent noise-isolation, great sound and a good app experience with advanced features for sound and fit. All of this however means nothing if I can't use the headphones for more than a couple hours at a time. Comparing these to the Liberty 2's, the battery life is a fraction of what I used to get. These are definitely NOT all-day headphones. Doesn't seem to matter what mode (normal, ANC, transparency) battery life is still an issue. I hope a future firmware update can help improve this problem!TLDR: If battery life and basic bluetooth connectivity features are not important to you then the sound on these is great but NOT worth $200.

When I'm listening to music and a call comes in so I answer it, the audio from calls gets picked up by my phone instead of the earbuds (I've tested on iPhone and Samsung). This drove me crazy, and it happens no matter if you're calling via messenger, whatsapp, Google meet, Instagram, or just calling a number.2. The earbuds don't always connect properly to the charging prons in the case even if they both show lighted up. I've had multiple times where only 1 bud gets charged even though they're aligned.3. The case don't hold charge and always show only 1 LED as light up even after just removing from chord4. The touch sensitivity is insane if you have hair near your ears. I had to turn off all touch functions on the bud cause it keeps jumping around because it sensed my hair.5. Transparency mode is only good for transiting and listening to the PA announcements in subway, it's very bad if you want to have a conversation while having both earbuds in. The pass through mode external sound clarity is about same as regular mode on Apple's Airpods6. The ""winged"" removable of the silicone tip to fit into earl cannel easily falls off when when removing them from your ears.7. When I had the earbuds in while walking in light rain / drizzling weather, the touch sensitivity would also register the raindrops that does land on the bud8.

And decided to get the Gen 3 version under the guise that it was a natural progression of the device. The good is that the sound output is pretty solid. It is also of solid build as you would expect from an Apple device.However if you are like me who's coming from an earlier version, then be wary of a few noticeable differences.Size: the gen 3 is noticeably shorter but rounder(fatter). As a result I found this version to be more uncomfortable and prone to slipping out. It doesn't quite have that secured(hook like) feeling, and I was always fearful of it falling out. Not sure why Apple changed the size of the airpods.Media control: I may be in the minority here but I used the tap feature on my Gen 2 frequently. And was surprised to see that this feature was changed to now button presses on the sides of the version 3. This a mind boggling change as the Gen 2 allows you to program the right and left buds. For example, double tapping the left may rewind and the right could fast forward. Of course you could change these to whatever suits you. This is a huge change and a feature I didn't know I needed. And just couldnt keep the Gen 3 due to this and the fit. I already felt anxious touching the sides of the Gen 3, so having to press the stems and risk it falling out was unneeded stress.So if you're a fan of Airpods Gen 2, just keeps these things in mind before getting the Gen 3.

The case itself is bulky and looks dated. The earbuds themselves, while relatively compact — unfortunately for me, they felt very uncomfortable and terrible after 20 minutes of normal usage. There are also no air-vents to help alleviate the pressure sensation, which I found surprising for ANC earbuds.The sound profile is average at best, and certainly nothing to rave about (again for the brand name and the MRSP asking amount of such premium earbuds). The bass is while decent, highs / trebles often sounded harsh and even over-processed at times. ANC technically works but only to a minimum degree, therefore making it subpar in quality. I was rather surprised as the Elite 7 Pros' are Jabra's most recent flagship earbuds. The transparency / ""hear through"" mode doesn't work well and isn't really noticeable when on or off. Phone call quality sounded terrible and was the ultimate deal breaker for me...as if you're speaking to someone underwater (it has a horrible odd distortion / high-pitch artificial sound). The app works as advertised, but is also buggy and has it's own set of issues (random odd connectivity dropouts).Everything with these flagship earbuds left me wanting so much more (especially at full MRSP). I was really underwhelmed and disappointed, ending up returning these earbuds the very next day (even though I got these on sale with $100 off).Honestly, I would look elsewhere and can not recommend getting the Jabra Elite 7 Pros' at full asking price. There are definitely better, more modern earbud options these days — at the same price or even at the sub $200 price range.

I could have a normal conversation with them in. Most products sound like you're talking in a bathtub, and some were truly atrocious (Surface 2 Headphones ... wow, bad).* Unlike many earbuds, the sound profile is neutral, so you don't get the boomy bass and rolled off treble that's typical of most earbuds. If you're a fan of jazz, classical, acoustic music, or any other genre that can benefit from neutrality, you owe it to yourself to try these. The resolution is quite good, too, as is the sound staging.* The app is truly a one stop shop to administer the earbuds, and the ability to tailor their response to your actual hearing (yes, that's an option) may be a bit frightening if you're like me and discover you have significant hearing loss in one ear, it can only help get you a more balanced response from the earbuds.Dislikes* When assigning options to the button on each earbud, volume is not one of the options. This leaves you to use a digital assistant to raise or lower the volume, or the rocker on your phone. With my old Airpod Pro 2 earbuds, I could do the volume right from the earbuds themselves.* Update: I have had multiple callers tell me they can barely hear me on the other end, using terms like 'you sound like you're underwater' or 'you sound like you're talking through a mask'. The minute I switch to speaker, they can hear me fine. This is an issue noted by MANY owners of this set of earbuds, as well as other previous models (75t). Detective work on the Internet shows that this problem has been at least a couple of years since discovery, with no fix, and with prior models showing the same issues, it's clear there's no fix coming. I still LOVE the sound of these earbuds, and continue to use them for music consumption, but the minute I find another set of earbuds that approach this neutrality and still let me make a decent phone call, these are going into the garbage. The entire point of earbuds like this is that you have a full headset.

The sound is exceptionally clear and crisp, with perfectly balanced bass. The customization options available exceed any of my previous experiences, including those with AirPods Pro.Battery Life: The battery longevity is impressive, easily supporting extended listening sessions without frequent recharging.Cons:Ergonomics: The design is where the WF-1000XM5 falls short. The earbuds are round and constructed from a glossy, slippery plastic, making them difficult to handle both in and out of the case. This design flaw has led to several instances of dropping them, despite my careful handling.App Interface: While the accompanying app is functional, it's somewhat cumbersome to navigate. The explanations for advanced features are not as clear as they could be, necessitating a steeper learning curve for users.Conclusion:The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds are a sonic delight, sure to satisfy any audiophile's cravings for high-quality audio.

They are world class leading when it comes to Active Noise Cancellation and that is apparent as soon as you put these on. Starting with the material that is used to insert in your ear lobe. It’s not a rubber like other models I’ve used but this is more of a foam material which helps these buds from falling out of my ears compared to many other buds I’ve tried. They also really help to create a strong seal which is crucial for any good ANC headphone. The sound quality of these are amazing and can even be further improved to your liking by installing the app and using the built in EQ. It’s not just a simple EQ that allows you to control treble or bass. So you start by playing some music and it presents you with different options to choose from, based on the sound that sounds best to you after a few selections voila you have your personalized custom EQ setting created! You can create multiple personalized EQ’s for all different genre types. This was a setting that really impressed me. Sound quality is top notch after installing the app and setting up the EQ. I tried the 360 Reality Audio and it is really impressive. Takes these buds to the next level of immersion. The app itself is really easy to use and has all the settings that you’d expect to get with a quality pair of wireless headphones. You can see the battery percent of each bud as well as the charging case battery. Battery life on these last hours and the case should provide an additional 3 charges so you don’t ever have to worry about your battery dying with these. They charge up super fast too. Honestly no complaints here. Don’t worry we’ll get to what I didn’t appreciate as much soon and where I think these could be improved.Cons/room for improvements:- These buds are hard to take out of their charging case because of their smooth plastic design. I wish they were easier to handle and pull out of their case.- the touch functionality is a hit or miss. For me it’s mostly a miss. If you happen to touch your headphones to readjust them in your ears you may turn ANC on or off or enable Passthrough mode by accident. Sometimes I pause my music by mistake. Luckily you can turn off the touch settings in the app and just use your phone to change song or raise or lower the volume if needed.- the pass through isn’t great either compared to something like the AirPods. With these it feels like the surrounding sounds are being played in your ear like a speaker making it sound less natural.- the price of these are definitely on the higher end of the spectrum.Overall:Overall I would rate these a 4/5 based on my experience using them and taking everything into consideration. If they were maybe $100 cheaper I would easily recommend these but due to the high asking price (currently $429.99 CAD) these are probably not the best value you can find in 2023.

I happen  to  have the Bose high end earbuds, which although are a bit larger, fit far more comfortably. I do have a peculiar ear canal shape on one ear, so that does make it trickier for me to be comfortable and for the buds to stay onIf I just stay at my desk and work, browse, look around, the buds stay on no problem. I would not walk around much in these, even  less do any form of activity.Before I go into sound quality, the noise cancelation, which it has three levels of, is pretty good, but is not stellar.  I could still hear the ceiling fan this weekend (I was at a cottage that had one) when I was on full noise cancellation. The feedthrough, or ambient noise setting, where you can hear your surroundings quite well, is actually pretty cool. You can hear what's going on everywhere; I could hear the crickets outside with the windows closed.  I find the noise cancellation could have been better. Most of the cancellation is done by the buds. They fit so tightly, that it blocks a lot of the sound.Now for the quality: My favorite part was setting up the custom equalizer through the app. Very cool. It will have you go through a series of choices to pinpoint what your favorite eq settings are.Once that is done, wow, the sound is fantastic. Crystal clear, excellent sound with pretty darn good low frequencies.It supports the usual SBS and AAC codecs as well as LDAC, which sounds fantastic when using it  (my Sure Aonics headsets  spoiled me with the LDAC codec). No aptX, which is a shame, if you like to watch tv and have a transmitter for that (low latency).They come in a really nice and small case. Very easy to carry around.All in all, they sound fantastic.

Whats annoying is when you take the earbuds out of the box for longer without connecting them or the box is out of battery and  you can't turn them on even though they have battery, so i ha e to put them back in the box to wake them, and if the box is out of battery you have a problem even though they have battery. Thats stupid. The app also acts up with annoying notifications and the touch controls are not as configurable as they should. Some feature are annoyingly useless.Now the worst. The fit is very bad. Although they are very light the fit is based on the ear canal so it's not trustworthy and one tends to stay in a position and the other in another. As mush as i try to push them in, with the right size foams, i can ear them slipping out. I can't feel them secure in place although they never actually came off by them selfs completely, nonetheless its annoying. Also and something that kinda seems on purpose for you to loose one of them and have to buh it again is that the earplugs are very slippery. I mean why would you make something so smal and valuable so polished in a way they can easily slip out of your hands when grabbing them... Seems so obvious that i doubt that wasn't on purpose.For context i previously had the Sennheiser true wireles first edition, the sound quality was pretty much the same as these but the battery was bad and they had a defect that caused the battery to run out in 2 days or less, and they were very bad fo calls. But they had excellent fit and grip. Basically you just put it in your ear and twist it and it locks in place, the more you twisted it the more secure it got, was perfect aside from a litle disconfort that you got used to. I never ever had to ajust them on contraire of these sonys.All in all not worth the money at least untill sony makes a solution for the fit. I only didn't return them because i didn't like the ones from bose and i wouldn't buy the new Sennheiser true witeless because i think they should have sent replacements for a product that was defective.The box from these sonys also feels cheap.I'm a big fan of Sony for a long time but i think they didn't properly tested this ones and the reviews i read were rushed too.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],1,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,138,96,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 328, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5

3,"Great sound quality, but too many deal breakers for me",https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R2JZC25CVBZCFC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C33XXS56,25 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on August 4, 2023",2023-08-04,Canada,,"Here are my honest, frank and down to earth thoughts about these earbuds as a music producer and music lover who has tested more than 50 pairs of earbuds in the past 6 or 7 years:Size of case: Excellent! Much smaller than the XM4 and now finally similar in compactness to competing products.Size of buds: Much smaller, but still stick out a lot on me and look a bit funny - not my favourite physical form of the various buds on the market.Comfort: Really good when stationary, especially now that we have extra small tips. Bad when running. They are top heavy, as all of the weight is above the ear tip, meaning that when running, G-force pulls the device down with every step and that leverage tries to pull them out, creating a noise with every step. Buds which have their centre of mass below the tip, like Airpods Pro and 1More Comfobuds for example, do better in this regard.Sound: Excellent, acoustically speaking, and very enjoyable when stationary, but for me they are completely unusable for running, or even walking, because of the occlusion effect ; the extra loud thud that accompanies each step. This is a problem on many earbuds which fully or partially seal the ear canals, but it's especially terrible on these - the worst I've ever experienced.  Music and podcasts are drowned out by the super loud thuds from my steps. If you listen to your buds at a very loud volume you will probably not mind the thuds. You will also be on Google in 10 years, desperately searching for a cure to your life altering tinnitus, of which there isn't.Codecs:  They don't support AptX Low Latency or any AptX codec for that matter.  So when pairing them to an aptX Bluetooth transmitter there is significant lag between the visual and the audible, so I can't use them to practice piano or work on video and music projects.Wind reduction: A little worse than AirPods Pro 2, but they're both barely tolerable when riding a bike into wind.  It's now no longer a setting in the app, it's just automatic.  They don't come close to the superb wind reduction mode on 1MORE earbuds.ANC: Really good, though I feel they are cheating, as the seal of the deeper penetrating tips (compared to Airpods Pro and some others) are doing a lot more of the work than on other buds. It's easier to create the effect of really good active noise cancelling when the passive noise isolation is doing so much of the work already.  It's like wearing foam earplugs in that respect; of course they are going to reduce noise quite well, but that doesn't mean it's the ANC tech doing anything impressive.Transparency: Super disappointing. My $65 2 year old 1More Comfobuds Pro have better transparency, and sound more like I'm not wearing anything than the Sony's do. Airpods Pro 1 are several years old and have much better transparency. Airpods Pro2 are leaps ahead. The audio quality of the transparency (or Ambient mode as Sony calls it) is ok, but the problem is that it's too quiet and so I sound a bit 'trapped in my own head' and as if I'm slightly deaf.  There is also more hiss than on competing products. It's still far from Apple's transparency, unfortunately, and most surprisingly it's even below some budget buds like the above mentioned ones. If only that ambient slider would go up another 20% to match the volume of the real environment it would be much better, but then the hiss would be even louder and so perhaps that's why Sony turned it down, for fear of people complaining about the hiss.On the bright side, while Sony does not advertise this or even mention it anywhere, these buds have the same hearing-protecting feature that Apple calls ""adaptive transparency"" on the Airpods Pro 2.  This instantly reduces the volume of sudden loud sounds, like a hammer hitting a plank of wood or a chainsaw.  No one is talking about this, but having tested this I can confirm that it's there.Touch controls: I hate them. You have to tap FOUR times to increase the volume one level. So adjusting the volume requires an incredible amount of tapping, which causes a really loud, deep thud in the ear and pressure against the ear drums. Four unpleasant thuds per level-increase means a dozen thuds right into your ear drum just to go up or down 3 levels, which makes changing the volume something I just don't want to do, opting to reach for my phone instead. There is a section in the app that fools you into thinking it will let you change the taps, but it really doesn't at all. It only lets you swap the left ear with the right ear in terms of which ear controls ANC/Ambient and which controls the music. There's no way to change the number of taps assigned to a given action - you are stuck with the assignments Sony has chosen, which is really, really disappointing and such a waste.Conclusion: Others will love them I'm sure, and that's fantastic, but I am disappointed. The badly implemented and non-customizable touch controls, weak transparency and the worst occlusion of any premium buds I've tried, make them fall far short of my expectations for earbuds at this price.  When a $65 pair of earbuds has better sounding transparency and better controls than a pair 6.6 times their price, something has gone wrong here and I cannot score these any higher than 3 out of 5.  There are earbuds available for less money that are more comfortable, sound pretty much as good acoustically, have a much better thought out control system, much better transparency and are actually useable when walking and running.  I'm amazed Sony is able to charge $130 more than their biggest competition (AirPods Pro 2) whilst giving worse performance in most of the important areas.  Even the charging case feels cheap and creaky.",False,Colour Name: Black,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51B4c2lCn2L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51C45MZE16L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FKADdTyNL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uI7LAOVIL._SY88.jpg']",10,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,138,96,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 328, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5

2,Shockingly bad user experience...,,25 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2023",2023-11-15,United States,,"I've used many different brands of earbuds, and for the price, these are probably the worst I've used, to a degree I'm struggling to comprehend. Let's get one thing out of the way: they sound good. It's better than my AirPods Pro 2s. Everything else, and I mean everything else, is so much worse. Let's start at the top.These things are so slippery that I struggle to get them out of the case without dropping them. And for me, the shape is hard to get into my ears. Also, the case feels cheap. They charge $300 for these?Setup is a chore. You are required to use the app to access any of its features. And boy, is it a piece of work. From opening the app to first listening to anything took just over an hour. AN HOUR! You must log into a Sony account to get most of the high-end features to work, which is nonsense. And lord help you if you had a Playstation account 15 years ago. I appreciate the trouble Sony has gone to for security, but I had to do a 10-part captcha from hell twice to get into the account. And the translation to English in the app is poor at best, making the whole experience a head-scratching mess. The device pairing process is easy, however.The noise canceling is about as good as my 70-dollar no-name Chinese buds. Seems better at high-pitched things than general background noise, which is a strange feat as the former is much harder to pull off. I struggle to hear dogs barking, but my AC is as clear as a bell. The ambient pass-through is barely acceptable, not even in the same league as the AirPod Pros. Your voice tends to be over-amplified and slightly delayed, making talking to and understanding others a mess. The feature that mutes whatever you are listening to and turns off ANC when you start talking is hit or miss. It works about half the time when I start talking. The other half kicks on when any noise is picked up. Very annoying.Now, the reason I purchased these is Multipoint Bluetooth. This feature lets devices connect to multiple devices simultaneously and quickly switch between them. It's crucial for any work that has you bouncing between phone calls and working on a PC. Let me tell you, Sony's implementation is worse than useless. Can I connect to two devices? Sure. Can I stay connected to two devices? Absolutely not. When they are connected, does it switch seamlessly between the two? Also, absolutely not. If one is already making a sound, the other device can't be changed without silencing the first device. So, say you are listening to YouTube on your PC and get a call. To switch to the call, pause YouTube and anything else making sound, then answer the call. And about 50% of the time, it will switch. Otherwise, you have to change it manually. What is even the point? Even more fun is that the second device can't be switched to after some time, between 5 minutes and who knows how long, without manually going into settings and reconnecting first. Then you get another 5 minutes to a couple of hours of flaky ""fast switching"".The battery life is an actual lie. They claim 8 hours, but with all features turned off except playback, I got closer to 6. With ANC on, I may have gotten 4-5 hours. Each bud's battery seems to drain at different speeds as well. So, while one may have 10% left, the other is already dead.I would be less critical if these were $100 instead of $300. Crucially, though, even at $100, I would still return them. Other than sounding great, they are terrible to use. And for $100, I can get earbuds that sound just as good but aren't so finicky.In closing, I'm surprised Sony released such a poor product. They're so bad that it's tarnished my view of the company.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],8,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,94,72,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 328, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5
2,Not as good as previous generation.,,4 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023",2023-10-19,United States,,"While these are smaller, they are not better. I own the previous generation Sony 1000XM4 noise canceling ear buds, but unfortunately the right ear bud battery was dying after 2ish years of near constant use.Lucky me, or so I though, this new version released. I was excited they were smaller as I sleep with them to distract me from wife snoring, and my over thinking mind racing as I try to sleep.These ear buds suck.First, they're slick. Like, slippery when not wet. They're a pain to manipulate because the entire outer surface is a shiney black plastic. Going in the case, coming out the case, fitting the correctly to your ear. God forbid you drop one and have to grab it.Second, the previous generation has far better noise canceling. Putting those in was like tuning out the world. These XM5's won't tune out my wife's relatively low volume snoring on the best of nights. If I'm sleeping with one ear bud pointed away, or covered, from her side of the bed, the noise canceling does not work at all. Snoring comes through loud and clear, even over the noise I listen to to fall asleep. This was not an issue on the previous version. I had no issues sleeping on my side, or not pointing both ear buds in her direction to get adequate noise canceling. Obvious stuff gets through when it shouldn't.Third, and most annoying, the touch sensitivity on these things is insane. Not only will the briefest of brushes of the hand either pause what your listening to, or turn off noise cancelling, but so can your pillow case or any other fabric that brushes them. Sometimes activating multiple times in a single touch. Again, this was never an issue in the previous version. The only way to fix this is to turn the feature off entirely, making you wholely dependent on your phone to control playback or noise canceling functionality.I've been a big fan of Sony's noise cancelling for years now. I genuinely think it's the best in the business. But these headphones should be a hard pass for anyone looking to buy.Trust me when I say this: save yourself some money and buy the previous generation if you can find them. They are slightly bigger, but they are by far the better product and can be found cheaper.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],9,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,94,72,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 328, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5
2,Overrated and Overpriced,,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023",2023-12-27,United States,,"I was in the market for some ear buds that had noise cancellation while on phone calls. These were the highest rated online. THEY WERE FAR FROM THE BEST! For starters, setup with iOS would have been easier if Sony had a better app. The app crashed a couple times during the setup process due to it trying to update the ear buds firmware. Once I got past that I was able to dive into the settings within the app for the ear buds. There were many settings and nothing out of the ordinary. The feature to connect 2 devices at once via Bluetooth was nice. However the noise cancellation feature itself was sub-par. Even after trying all of the different size buds that came with the product and performing the in app test to make sure I had the correct fit. Noise Cancellation while on a phone call was good for the caller on the other end. But the disappointment to me was when I had the ear buds in, not playing anything with noise cancellation on. It would muffle the outside noise but not cancel it. I was as if I simply had ear plugs in. For that reason I returned them. The body of the ear bud was also large and heavy which caused it to fall out of my ear when simply walking. I've had AirPod Pros, Beats Fit Pro's and these Sony WF-1000XM5. AirPod Pros had better noise cancellation ability then these. The winner for me was the Beats Fit Pro.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],10,B0C33XXS56,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0C33XXS56?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B0C33XXS56&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,94,72,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 328, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",Sony WF-1000XM5

The noise cancellation is some of the best I've seen, they're very well constructed and feel premium (appropriate considering the $200+ price tag), and the sound quality is perfectly acceptable.Unfortunately, they're also the least pleasant headphones to actually interact with I've ever owned. All three sizes of earbud tips failed to stay secure in my ears, so I was constantly stopping what I was doing to nudge them back into place. This isn't helped by the fact that the touch controls are wildly inconsistent. A double touch plays and pauses the audio, and a long touch toggles the noise cancellation options, so while trying to push them back into your ear you're almost always going to be accidentally triggering a function and then having to tap again to undo it. These are also annoying to make work on purpose, sometimes requiring four or five double taps to actually play/pause.There's also something about the design of these that make them uniquely hard to hold. I've used wireless earbuds for years now, and I've never had issues with dropping them. The contour on the sides of these earbuds are sloped in such a way that it's impossible to hold them with any pressure, so you're always at risk of them slipping or popping out of your fingers when you pull them out of the case. I dropped one into traffic within the first few days. Thankfully managed to retrieve it with seemingly zero damage.Then one day (about two weeks after receiving them) the right earbud's volume was suddenly so low that I couldn't always tell it was powered on at all. I contacted support, thinking that there would be some kind of reset button or cleaning instructions. Nope, request a refund on Amazon. They wouldn't even talk to me, and there's no support documentation available.

2,Very disappointing,,5 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2022",2022-07-14,United States,,"I'm not a super audio nerd, but I've dealt with music all my life and worked in radio broadcasting, sound editing, mixing, composing, producing, and other stuff for over a few decades. I know what ""good"" sound is, for different uses & scenarios.After researching lists of best bluetooth earbuds, these popped up highly on a few well scouted lists. Ordered them, and almost immediately the trouble began.First off - the app. Completely useless. I'm sure it's probably abandoned by now, it refused to get past the ""can't see your device"" screen for 4 different devices I tried to connect it to. It would hook up to Bluetooth just fine, but app wouldn't work at all. Not one time. Chatbot help was in Chinese. No manual in the box, not even a QR code scan thing. No warranty info. Normally I wouldn't care so much, but without being able to check or toggle them in LDAC mode was very frustrating. There's no reason the app shouldn't work. Also, I read there is no in-app manual EQ. Anything that wants to even begin to think of calling itself ""audiophile"", needs to start from there with its app. Inexcusable if it's not in there.Second, the fit (for me personally) was very subpar. They come with different silicone tips, but the largest size & smallest size aren't that different, and if you put real quality foam tips on them it improves a lot, but then they won't fit back into the case. They never felt like they were ""in"" my ear all the way making a good seal. I always wanted to fiddle with them. This of course depends on your anatomy. The active noise canceling however did work a little, and had 3 noticeable different modes - ambient sound, off, and on. Figured that out randomly by tapping the earbud 3 times. Almost like that's something that should be explained in an included manual or something.Third - and most important (and subjective), the sound. They were...fine. Average. Nothing amazing in my opinion, and far far short of all the gleaming recommendations I've read. For headphones, some of my experiences go from MDR V-700S, HDJ-1000s & AT M50xs for spinning records, 7506s, HD280s & Fidelio X2HRs for editing, Bose qc35s & WH1000 XM2s for over ear Bluetooth headphones, to Google pixel buds series A & Shure SE215s for Bluetooth in-earbuds to name just some.In direct comparison, the pixel buds A sound a little better, fit a little better, have an actual usable app & great Google integration, and are almost $50 cheaper (give or take, depending on sales) than the Evos.In a completely different league though, are the Shure se215s. These things (to me) are probably the best pick you can get for affordable bluetooth IEMs. They fit well with good 3rd party eartips, and sound incredible, especially for the price. The sound stage is wide yet isolated, separation and distinction is great, bass is deep & booming & punchy but not muddy, and bright, wide, non-harsh highs. They're 5 times the headphones the 1more Evos are. Plus, they're usually under 100$. They're worth 3 times that, easy.I could go on and nit pick more about other little things, but my point is made. They're just not worth it to me. Audio is such a unique, personal thing, that these may sound & fit amazing to you, and you'll think I'm crazy. This is just how my ears hear them. I'm very very disappointed, but these are going back.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],4,B09Q31SGTP,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09Q31SGTP?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09Q31SGTP&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=two_star&sortBy=helpful,38,25,twoStar,"{'price': {'value': 124.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",1MORE Evo

However, I must say I'm disappointed. The right earbud is clearly defective, as its battery drains much faster than the left earbud.

I've tried charging them fully, but the problem persists.I have lost confidence in 1MORE, as I have bought three earbuds from them.

4,Great sound for a very small package,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R1XJSXSNXQKQIJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q31SGTP,14 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in Canada on May 17, 2022",2022-05-17,Canada,,"(take it with a grain of salt)(Tried with an iPhone it works fine with all its features) (Review is subject to change as updates rolls in)May 20: I have been having issues with the earphones cutting out randomly when using LDAC (in adaptive mode), a distance from my head to my pocket shouldn't really cause any issues and I know this is not due to interference because I have been in a park for 6 hours and it would cut out still, not to mention that I also did an audiophile session where I just sat on a chair and listened to my favourite tracks while the phones is on the table next to me so range is also not an issue I believe. This issue should be fixed as soon as they can.A gust of wind is very audible through ANC and Transparent mode.ANC: It could be better, I would say Apple's ANC is a bit better but this isn't that far behind in my opinion. Transparency mode sound a bit muffled and could definitely sound better, I don't know if software could fix it.Update May18: After a whole day of real world test it definitely isn't bad and is better than an earpod in some circumstances, with an earpod it tends to muffle everything around while the evo makes your world sounds like it doesn't have any low frequency but it blocks machine noises with ease.Sound Quality: Is very good especially with LDAC I can't speak of the dynamics of it because everybody has different ears and this product tries to cater to the best of its ability, I just really hope soon we will have a way to EQ the earphones to your liking, SoundID is good but the demo songs they provided makes it difficult to tune it. The out of the box EQ is terrible I recommend setting up SoundID as soon you set it up.There are times it sounds fine on the demo music but once you listen to the songs you usually listen to it may overshoot the bass or high frequencies and could sound very harsh, you definitely have to spend some time with it.Without using SoundID the default tune sounds dead and tight with pretty harsh mids, SoundID helps with the stereo separation as well making it sound wider.Build quality: The charging case is great, it is made out of metal and rubbered below, something to consider though is the case does get cold for being metal. Having keys in your pocket with the case doesn't scratch it that easily which is a surprise after a whole day of work.The earphones itself is plastic but it doesn't feel cheap and styling looks great at least to me with the round copper accent on it.Controls: This one is pretty weird, it's double tap to pause/play, hold to change ANC and tripple tap for your assistant.Single tap does nothing at the moment it can probably be added through software update, for now I have no way to change the song through the earphone's controls without sacrificing other functions.Features: This earphone is integrated to the Android eco-system pretty nicely, when you first pair it a little window would come up from your phone like an earpod connecting to an iPhone, find my earphone also works on this and gets connected to your google account.It pauses the music when you take one off works fine and latency isn't too bad either.Comfort: I have had no fatigue while testing this for 3hrs and it is not bulky, looks good on your ears as well.Update May18: After a whole day of testing, I have not have any discomfort while working the whole day. Passive noise cancellation is good as well, good to note as well that the tips are oval and not round.Battery: Pretty good for 3hrs coming from 100% you're left with 70-80% at around 80-100% volume ANC OFFSomething to add is that the app is pretty limited and basic at the moment and has a 2.3 star review, hopefully they could sort that out in the upcoming months because the product they're producing are really good.Summary:Pros:Great Sound (LDAC)Great pair with the Android eco-systemGood featuresGreat build qualityUnboxing looks very professionalUSB CGood battery lifeCons:Software side is basicControls needs an updateANC could use some tweakingLack of EQ controlMore eartip options would be nice.",True,Colour Name: Black,"['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Gn-VTEj5L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yN9T5jXEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XyfXAN6PL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lyiAp2rGL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/710nBkGrs+L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714LUt5TA2L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZxirNIacL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hsTKpvmeL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71u6QzizmpL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RrZMRtXcL._SY88.jpg']",1,B09Q31SGTP,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09Q31SGTP?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09Q31SGTP&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=four_star&sortBy=helpful,153,64,fourStar,"{'price': {'value': 124.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",1MORE Evo

From the unboxing experience to the sound quality and features, it can compete with 250$+ TWS earbuds.The earbuds feels nice and solid. They are made out of plastic which makes them light and doesn't feel hollow or cheap like some other offering. The case itself feels awesome, it has a aluminium feels and a weight that convey quality.The earbuds fits nicely in the ear. Although the fit doesn't feel as secure as other at first, when the eartips warms up, it creates a nice seal and won't move at all. The small size also help to makes the really comfortable for long listening time.The app is really good and since they've update it, they added manual EQ to customize the sound to fit your taste. ANC and transparency mode works really good. I wish the app had more customization on the tap features but it still does the job.About the sound, it has 1 dynamic driver for the lows/mids and 1 balanced armature for the high-mid/highs. Out of the box, it has a slight W shape that has probably too much highs and can be quite fatiguing. Bass is controlled and goes low, really low. You get some rumble that are really nice when going under 40hz.  Mids are quite nice but the dip at 3khz really hurts some details for vocals and instruments. I had to play with the manual EQ to make them enjoyable, bring the mids to life and tame the highs to soften the treble response.Soundstage and instrument separation are quite good for TWS earbuds. It still can't compete with some similarly priced wired IEM but still enjoyable for a earbuds on the go.Overall really impressed with these earbuds.

3,Very good sound...not so good options and BT conductivity,https://www.amazon.ca/gp/customer-reviews/R310T0B0GPP4KO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q31SGTP,,"Reviewed in Canada on December 22, 2023",2023-12-22,Canada,,"I've been using these earbuds for the past six(6) months and this is my experience with them.  They've been used listening to different genres of music.  I listen to metal/extreme metal, rock, 70s adult contemporary, popular/dance music, disco, rap and classical...just to name a few.  I have some Jabras and Beats earbuds and prefer using the 1more for sound quality, but like the options of the other manufacturers.The bass sound on these really shine with the bone crushing bass in technical death metal. The sound of the mids and highs are great with all types of music and sound well-rounded. Overall the sound on these earbuds are very good.  The quality of the sound they produce also depend on the source of your audio.  I've used them listening to CD quality audio and online sourced music and found a difference.  The CD audio sounds more full.  The bass is deep and the highs are crystal clear and everything in-between sounds great.Options:I do have issues with BT connection being choppy depending on where on my body I have my 1+10 PRO or sixth Gen iPod with CD quality audio.  The sound degrades at times and cuts out for a few seconds.  I think this has to do with the source device, since this didn't happen with my S22.  The interference usually happens on my walks outside.  I usually don't use the ANC outside, since it doesn't work with higher frequency sounds like wind whistling and birds chirping.  In my experience the ANC is only usable inside.  If it is windy outside I always have to wear a winter hat or earmuffs over my ears to silence the wind noise.I also recommend cleaning them often with hydrogen peroxide, since this will also affect the sound quality.  My left side stopped working, so I cleaned it before contacting the seller and it worked.  The wax from your ears will plug the screens on them, so clean them at least once a month.  I use a cotton tip dipped in peroxide and brushed light across the screen with the earbud tips removed.The hear through is handy and works well and is turned on by holding your finger on the bud face for 3secs.  The button on these are conductive, so they don't work with gloves on.  Would be better if they had a physical button to push with single tap active.  The button double and triple touch allocations work okay.  Like many I pull them out to pause, which doesn't work that well.  The photo sensor used isn't very reliable, even if you put them in a pocket.  I end up having to use the pause on the device I'm using.  I have other earbuds that work a lot better and shutoff the whole time they're out.The fit of them is great and they are really comfortable.  I barely can feel them while they're in.  It's nice having the ability to have different tip sizes, since my ear canals are different sizes.  The tips don't lock in place and do have a habit of turning, so they need to be checked regularly.  This will affect the fitment and will allow outside noise in and music out, which you don't want.  I can usually tell when they do turn and have to remove, reposition and reinstall them.The battery life and charger are good for what I need.  I listen to music throughout the day and usually get the listed listening/charging times, so no complaints there.  Phone calls are good while inside, but haven't used them outside in windy conditions.The app is okay and is functional.  The adaptive sound option is great for listening to different genres of music.  This allows you to fine tune the music equalization to your ears and create different types of listening experiences.Overall, I listen to these strictly for the sound they produce and not for the options.  Wish I got them now that they're cheaper than the price I paid.Hope this helps.",True,Colour Name: Black,[],1,B09Q31SGTP,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09Q31SGTP?reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&asin=B09Q31SGTP&scope=reviewsAjax1&filterByStar=three_star&sortBy=helpful,87,54,threeStar,"{'price': {'value': 124.99, 'currency': '$'}, 'listPrice': None}",1MORE Evo
