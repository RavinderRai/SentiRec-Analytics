Headphone,Review_Text,Summary
Sony WF-1000XM4, [Applause] well he is embedded [Music] nice [Applause] noise canceling [Music] so you've probably read or watched people lose their minds over the sony wf-1000xm4 and trust us when we say it is absolutely worth the hype and the reason why is because these earphones are one of only few that can really go toe-to-toe with apple's airpods and there is a lot to like here this updated version features a significantly smaller design than its predecessor in both the earbuds themselves and the portable charging case forty percent smaller to be exact while also adding in wireless charging this means that not only does the charging case provide you with an additional two charge cycles its sleek design makes it much more portable than its predecessor but the earbuds themselves are the main story here and sony's r d team were able to completely overhaul these earbuds for example they now use bluetooth 5.2 and take advantage of improved silicon which sony calls the v1 processor and this reportedly increases processing power while giving you longer battery life in order to boost isolation performance sony has ditched the silicon ear tips and opted for a polyurethane foam which can be compressed to the shape of your ear canal much better than silicon and sony has also gone a step further and included a selection of ear tips in varying sizes in the box to help you achieve the best fit possible like its predecessor the sony wf-1000xm4 features touch controls giving you access to playback volume your voice assistant of choice and ambient sound controls for example by default on the right earbud you tap once for play pause tap twice to skip track and tap three times to go to the previous track and all of the touch controls can be customized using the sony headphones connect app for android and ios i use the sony wf-1000xm3 as my daily driver and my biggest gripe with them is that it doesn't have any water resistance but thankfully that has all changed because with the sony wf-1000xm4 it now features an ipx4 rating meaning that i could take this out in the rain or to the gym and not have to worry about them at all and trust me when i say these earbuds at the gym with active noise cancelling on an absolute treat [Music] so all that's fine and well but how do these actually perform it's complicated but mostly a good story while it's tending to start with how these sound let's talk about anc first and for long time subscribers you've probably watched chris's video on isolation but long story short outside noise if it's too loud can mask your music and so the most important thing about any headphone or earphone is how well it deals with outside noise the sony wf-1000xm4 is crazy good at this and by switching from silicon to foam ear tips these new earbuds block out twice as much outside noise and that's before the anc unit does anything that's exceptionally good because anc doesn't cancel out incidental noise like people talking around you things getting dropped or any other short noise only isolation can do that and the most important thing that earphones or headphones can do is block out noise rather than cancel it but the anc on the sony wf-1000xm4 is really really good for a pair of true wireless earbuds for droning noises in the full range of your music the anc unit can drop those sounds to anywhere from one quarter to one eighth as loud as they would be without anything in your ears as you can imagine these earbuds would be great during your commute whether you're on a bus on a train or on an airplane whenever we get to do that again [Music] so now that we've established that outside noise is probably not going to affect your listening experience how do these actually sound well that's where it gets a little complicated out of the box the sony wf-1000xm4 boosts all notes lower than middle c by about 2 to 4 decibels over our already somewhat bassy target normally this would be a non-issue but the earphones also cut highs by almost 10 decibels making the out of the box sound very bass heavy you're gonna want to use sony's app for the best results not just for the fit test but to also tweak the sound to your liking and if you want our recommendation we suggest creating an eq preset with these settings to get the best starting point for your sony wf-1000xm4 sony's app also gives you the ability to switch between different anc and eq presets based on your location for example you could have the headphones activate active noise cancelling while you're at work and then while you're at the gym you could have the earphones boost bass notes and then at the park the earphones could let in some ambient sound so that you're aware of your surroundings now personally i don't use this feature because i'm all about drowning up the world however i see this useful for people who don't want to keep changing their settings manually every time they move around when it comes to connectivity these earbuds also support high-res audio streaming with the ldac bluetooth codec and this is available on android when enabled in the developer settings and if you're on ios don't worry these earbuds also support spc and aac for wireless audio if you're not using ldac then you can expect these earbuds to last around 7 hours and 43 minutes like it did in our tests it's a hair shorter than what sony claims but not appreciably so and if you do use ldac well then that figure drops to around 5 hours [Music] so now for the 280 question should you buy the sony wf-1000xm4 well if you're willing to shell out the cache for it then yeah absolutely these earphones are truly a pair of do everything true wireless earbuds thanks to its impressive active noise cancellation and isolation deep integration with the sony headphones connect app and its ipx4 water resistance rating while its price tag might be steep for some and its out of the box sound signature may need a little tweaking i believe that the sony wf-1000xm4 is well worth its price especially if you're like me who uses in-ears on a daily basis and are willing to invest in a reliable pair of true wireless earbuds that feature great active noise cancelling [Music] you,"If you want the best true wireless earphones, the Sony WF-1000XM4 has to be in the discussion among the most popular models. It has its foibles, but it's probably the most mature stab at the true wireless design that includes ANC. Still, the price is tough to surmount."
Apple AirPods Pro (1st generation), so I never liked the original air pods they look stupid they never fit my ears and let's be honest they sounded terrible but that didn't stop them from being one of the most popular audio products of the last couple of years now Apple has released the air pods Pro and I have to say I'm a believer so we should start with the new design Apple has finally ditched the one-size-fits-all style of the ear pods and created a brand new revolutionary magical new way to get these to fit with everyone silicone ear tips okay jokes aside these are actually pretty cool and one of those clever little tweaks that a company does every once in a while that makes me go hmm why didn't no one do this before the air pods Pro come with three different sizes of ear tips and they snap in and out of the earbud really easily so no more wrestling with the nozzle to get a new ear tip to fit Apple also included a new fit test that will let you know if you're using the right sized ear tips or if you should swap them out for a different pair it's good to see Apple taking fit so seriously I'm not gonna say that we had a hand in it here at sound guys but that's what I like to tell myself before I go to sleep at night because we've been harping on this fit for ever of course the downside of the ear tips is that if you lose them you'll have to buy them directly from Apple but thankfully they're only like four dollars or something so surprisingly it won't cost you too much it's because of these tips that should enable more people to use them without a problem as someone that literally couldn't even tie my own shoe without the original ear pods falling out of my ears I haven't had a single problem like that with the air pods Pro I took two different flights with them and a few trips to the gym and had no issues with them falling out at all speaking of you can now take these to the gym thanks to the new ipx4 sweat proof certification so just like the power beats Pro you can take these for a run and not worry about damaging them then we get to the earbuds themselves which are completely redesigned I'm still of the opinion that they look utterly ridiculous but I'm able to forgive Apple here because the design is actually functional the earbud is slightly angled and curved so it now sits in my ears better and the stupid stem thing is way shorter now and also has a really handy squeezed input on the flat section of the stem now I should preface this by saying that I love squeezing things as an input that I think it's quirky and fun and I use it all the time on my pixel 3 to activate the Google assistant but I'm convinced that it's real purpose was for playback controls because these work perfectly and seamless every time it's way less error-prone than touch sensitive swipes and taps and it also doesn't have the suction problem that so many other true wireless earbuds have when you're pushing the earbuds into your ears and the force causes them to go in even further and it's just an uncomfortable experience these are just more comfortable and reliable and I'm here for it that said you can't control volume with these which is a bummer but you can still pause music and skip between tracks by squeezing each earbud has a mesh covered microphone along the outside with other sensors and another microphone on the inside that Apple uses for things like auto pause when you've removed one from your ears now keep in mind that's a feature that you'll only get with iOS devices so the charging case itself really isn't a big deal here it's pretty much the same exact thing just slightly bigger and now it also opens along the wide horizontal side instead but it's just as portable and easy to carry as ever so there's no real concerns here the air pods also both perfectly snap back into place magnetically just like the originals so no real changes in that aspect so if you've ever used a pair of headphones that have apple's h1 chip like the original air pods or any of the newer Beats products but there's really nothing new here it's the same process so as soon as you open the case near an iOS device a card will pop up that will allow you to click to connect automatically once you do so it will connect to all other devices on your iCloud I was able to listen to a podcast on my phone and then switch over to my iPad for a quick meeting and then switch back to my phone after all that with no issues again nothing new here if you've used any other h1 enabled devices but still just as seamless as always assuming you're in the Apple ecosystem Android and Windows users won't have a seamless a transition between devices and the initial pairing process does require you to enter Bluetooth settings but I'm still surprised at how well these worked even with Android devices of course you won't get some of the cooler features like auto pause or even the fit test but you'll still get great connection strength between the two earbuds playback controls and you'll even get the two best features which are the active noise-cancelling and the transparency alright so speaking of the noise cancelling in the transparency mode let's get into it because these are the two newest features of the air pots Pro offer and they work perfectly active noise-cancelling in particular is surprisingly good for a pair of ear buds and I think that's in no small part due to again these just having a better fit thanks to the ear tips but they do a solid job of canceling ambient outside noise I even wear these on a plane and while they obviously aren't ideal they get the job done for the most part what was even better for that particular situation was the transparency mode which you can activate by long squeezing the stem of the air pod this uses the microphones to let you hear what's going on around you and not only that it amplifies the sounds it's like you have the most boring superpower ever and you only had to pay a few hundred dollars to get it it is genuinely useful though and I found myself using it constantly just because of how easy it is to switch to of course these aren't the only true wireless earbuds that have these features the sony WF 1000x Mark threes also have active noise cancelling and transparency mode as well the active noise cancelling is actually better on those too so don't think that you're stuck buying air pods because there are other options out there just not a lot of them which is why it's so interesting to see Apple actually early to the party here and actually competing with some of these features considering how small the air pods Pro are and the fact that they now have active noise canceling I was expecting battery life to be shorter than the original air pods but that really isn't the case and I still managed to get 5 hours and 6 minutes of constant playback with active noise canceling turned on well this is far from being the best battery life we've seen with true wireless earbuds it's still way better than average which tends to be around 3 to 4 hours of constant playback these even beat out those Sony earbuds that we mentioned earlier by a solid 15 minutes once they do die you can just toss them back into case that charge them up again the case holds another 20 ish hours of battery life and just 5 minutes in the case we'll quick charge them to give you about 1 hour of playback one thing that's worth mentioning here is that the air pods Pearl still charge via lightning Apple you were so freaking close on the bright side you can charge these with any qi wireless chargers so that's a plus so Apple claims that they gave the air pods pro and auto EQ feature and I hope you can hear the air quotes that measure up to 200 times a second in order to constantly adjust the active noise-cancelling and to test the fit of the earbuds in your ear just to make sure that your music sounds best of course this is borderline impossible to test since there's only one of me and my ears are gonna be the same every time but we did manage to get a pretty decent frequency response graph in our testing because of the ear tips and a relatively good isolation these sound obviously better than the previous version the low end of these still isn't going to be on par with the power beats pro by any means but they're significantly more powerful than the air pods - the fact that you can actually hear the bass with these highlights that it's fairly tight and controlled with just a slight bit of emphasis so give those tiny drivers inside a little bit of help low end and Gaia eat that by bad bunny which I hope I pronounced right made its presence felt without sounding forced or fake which is a trap that earbuds of the size tend to fall into in order to make the low-end heard don't get me wrong you're still gonna be missing out on some of your favourites sub bass synths but drum kicks and deep voices come through just fine speaking of voices the air pods Pro do a good job at reproducing vocals as well they have a somewhat neutral frequency response all throughout the mids even if it is a little bit bumpy this means that no one note in the mid-range will be made to sound louder than any other just because of the headphones that said you can see that this is exactly the case in the highs where notes around 11 kilohertz and above have some green peaks of extra emphasis this can be a bit of an issue when listening to songs like songbird by Corey Chazelle which I feel the strumming into guitar squeaks approach the point of harshness instead of clarity still it isn't an issue in most songs and I'll take this over the previous air pods frequency any day of the week so one aspect that can't be overlooked and talking about the air pods Pro is the microphone how is it so most human vocals tend to lie between 100 Hertz and 3 kilohertz somewhere in that range and mids and these do a pretty good job but not over emphasizing or de-emphasizing any one part of that range well they're not perfectly neutral you shouldn't have any problems when talking on the phone as you can probably tell by this video where I'm talking to you through the air pots so should you buy the air pods Pro well I think you already know the answer to that question but I'll make it easy for you yes because the air pods Pro are actually good now they sound better they fit better they actually have competitive features like active noise canceling and transparency mode they're still super portable and yes they still look kind of but if you were the kind of person that was gonna buy air pods anyway then you're not gonna regret buying these because like I said they're actually good now but if you wouldn't be caught dead wearing any kind of air pods and lucky for you there are other options as well such as the Sony W F 1000 X mark 3s that I mentioned of course the Sony buds aren't cheap at around two hundred and forty nine dollars but then again these new air pods Pro also cost two hundred and forty nine dollars just like the Sony's the air Potts Pro are definitely a splurge but at least they're finally a splurge worth considering like I said at the beginning I'm a believer now and that should pretty much do it for review of the air pods Pro thanks for watching if you want to know more about these headphones or any of the other products we review make sure to check out sound guys calm while you're here make sure to subscribe to the youtube channel if you haven't already and also we have a podcast so you should probably listen to that link down the description I'm Adam Alina happy listening I'm sorry what no I I can't hear you I have the new air pods,"For just $50 USD more than the original model with the wireless charging case, this is definitely the pair of buds to get. The AirPods Pro (1st generation) sounds better than the originals and has a way better fit and active noise canceling to boot. If you have an iOS device, just get this. "
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, so Bose released their quiet Comfort Ultra earbuds and they got everything right except for one thing and if you've got five minutes I'll tell you what that is first off if you thought that these earbuds looked familiar you'd be right they are virtually identical to the old quiet Comfort earbuds however there are a few design tweaks that help make it better what I like is there's a little nub that keeps the fin in place instead of letting it roll around and prevent your earbuds from charging ing or closing the charging case you also never have to worry about it fitting incorrectly because well there's a nub there it holds it in place in terms of playback controls these use a capacitive touch surface rather than a button to prevent you from pushing in your earbuds or compromising the seal excellent I love this some people may not like it if they live in colder climbs but to that I say I live in Canada you're wrong Bose finally has a higher bitri codec in in this in Apex adaptive if you have the Snapdragon sound you're going to enjoy a much better Fidelity sound than you were previously if you had the older earbuds Big Win also it supports Bluetooth 5.3 which through a firmware update later once the standard becomes more widespread we might see certain things like low energy audio or lc3 make its debut on a Bose product also cool futureproof uh obviously there's the same USBC charging and while there's no advertised fast charging you don't really need a fast charging standard in order to get a lot of listening time out of something with a really teeny tiny battery like these earbuds a full charge should last you about 6 hours in 11 minutes as it did in our testing rig with Peaks about 75 DB as far ASC goes these are some of the best earbuds we've tested in a long time you can expect to get about 30 DB of attenuation below 500 HZ which is really good that means engine noise the rumbles of your everyday life are going to be quieted by an insane degree now there is a little weird cutout in between uh 500 HZ and and 1 khz but that's really not a huge deal a lot of that is a harmonic detail um and it's stuff that's going to be masked by your music listening anyway the immersive audio feature sounds good on paper in reality I didn't much care for it and when I tried it out it sounded a lot like I was listening to my speakers in front of me and with the head tracking having a little bit of lag I turned that feature off and if I wanted to listen to my speakers I would just do that the feature is interesting if you're into that sort of thing but it doesn't add a ton to the experience now I was really dreading coming in today because of this next bit these earbuds are way too Bassy and I mean by a lot even with a default tuning we were unable to get a good result that had had uh less than a 15 dbel overemphasis in the subbase and base additionally there's a rather sharp emphasis in the highs that you'll probably want to tone down but the three band equalizer is insufficient at getting that where it should be now we tried using the Bose app try to get a usable result and we kind of succeeded it's okay but you'll find that certain kinds of content are just not very good or not very fun to be around when you're listening to these for example the obvious answer comes up with movie content especially you like Christopher Nolan movies who like to Rattle your skull with Bas every time somebody's not talking now to my mind there are only three alternatives to these earbuds right now they are the airpods pro second generation the jabber Elite 10 and the Sony wf1000x M5 think I got that one right all of these earphones have something to offer over these earbuds however none of them is really the complete package there are trade-offs with all of them the Apple earphones the cheapest of the bunch do have a few issues when moving over to Android so if you have an Android phone you're going to be missing out on a lot of features that are standard on the Bose but are not available with the Apple earphones the Jabra 10 has had some tuning issues the sound quality may not be what you're looking for uh because it's got a very strange frequency response now you can mess with that and EQ settings but it's a bit of work and the Sony wf1000 xm5 is really great on paper is very expensive it's got a better microphone and frequency response but it may not be what you're looking for in terms of fit so should you rush out and buy the Bose quiet Comfort Ultra earbuds no probably not let it sit for a bit there are sales coming up Black Friday and Christmas are around the corner right now these are not I don't recommend these however they're not bad they're just not bad they're just not $300 good all right looking at the imaginary clock on the wall that's been 5 minutes I'm Chris Thomas and thank you for joining us at sound guys happy listening,"The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are a competent set of wireless in-ears, but an overly-bassy sound and a high price may deter some. For others, it's an extremely safe pick at the $300 price point owing to its Snapdragon Sound support."
Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation), the second generation airpods Pros are one of the best noise canceling earbuds currently on the market but before you snag a pair for yourself here are five things you need to know about Apple's Flagship earbuds at first glance the second generation airpods Pro really doesn't look any different from its predecessor it still has the same plastic construction same ipx4 water resistance rating and similar playback controls however there are a few improvements worth taking a look at for starters the stem on the earbuds are now touch sensitive which allows you to change your volume from the airpods personally I found this method of volume control far more intuitive than my current daily driver earbuds which are the Sony wf-1000xm4 also the 2nd gen airpods Pro now include extra small sized ear tips for people with well extra small ears Apple has also made the new airpods Pro easier to find the charging case Now features the company's U1 chip for improved location tracking in the find my app there is also a speaker on the bottom of the case which can emit a sound while looking for your airpods pro also Apple added a silver lanyard Loop to keep you from losing your earbuds in the first place by the way if you want to learn more about the new airpods Pros design or see any of our full Suite of tests be sure to check out the full review on soundguys.com when it comes to sound quality these second generation airpods Pro sounds great and will make most music sound good so long as you have a good fit and if you want to learn more about why good fit matters be sure to check out this video in the corner when looking at our measurements for the new airpods Pro you can see that its frequency response closely matches with our Target curve which is a measurement of what we believe sounds good to most people the chart also shows that the airpods pro has some added emphasis in the lower frequencies which many gym goers and EDM fans such as myself will appreciate our measurements also indicate that the airpods pro has less emphasis in the high frequencies when compared to our Target curve while this isn't necessarily a deal breaker you may find that harmonic detail like higher pitched vocals strings and hi-hats are a little difficult to hear during busy sections of a song also Apple doesn't offer any way to EQ the earbuds in iOS so you'll have to rely on third-party options personally I use Spotify which thankfully has a graphical EQ built into the app another really impressive feature from the second Generations airpods pro has to be its active noise canceling which Rivals the best ANC earbuds and headphones currently on the market from our tests the new airpods Pros great isolation and ANC performance allows it to reduce external Noise by 20 to 30 decibels depending on the frequency in other words these earbuds do a great job in blocking outside noise especially when you're commuting traveling by plane or just listening in a cafe or other busy environment also thanks to the pressure vents on the earbuds themselves the airpods pro feels very comfortable during long listening periods and I never feel like I have to jam the buds into my ears to get a Tight Seal in fact I find the airpods pro way more comfortable to wear than then my Sony wf-1000xm4 unlike its predecessor the second generation airpods Pro Now features adaptive transparency mode which minimizes the volume of loud unpredictable sounds rather than just amplifying all the noises around you other people have even used this feature at concerts when the volume gets too loud in other words this feature is really great for keeping aware of your surroundings and protecting your hearing while there is a lot to love about the second generation airpods Pro it's not for everyone and if you own an Android device we actually don't recommend that you buy the airpods pro just like oil and water airpods and Android just doesn't mix without an iPhone or iPad you aren't going to be able to take full advantage of the airpod pros Apple exclusive features including seamless device pairing automatic device switching and spatial audio you'll also miss out on essential features including firmware updates and device controls if you own the original airpods Pro you're probably wondering should I upgrade to the second generation well that depends like I said previously the new airpods Pro isn't that different from its predecessor its design and durability hasn't changed much minus the lanyard Loop and speaker on the case and based on our testing the sound quality is also pretty similar between the two models albeit with slightly less bass on the first gen airpods Pro however the second generation airpods Pro boasts better active noise cancellation performance and support for adaptive transparency mode so unless you really need those two features and you're willing to pay 249 US Dollars it may be worth just sticking with your original airpods Pro and saving a few hundred bucks again if you want to learn more about the second generation airpods Pro or see how the new airpods Pro compared to the original be sure to

next I'm Harley around with sound guys and until next time happy listening foreign [Music],"The Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) modestly improves upon the first-generation AirPods Pro and features the same iconic look. Apple's upgraded H2 chip begets better active noise canceling (ANC) and battery life, while the case's U1 chip and integrated speaker lets you precisely locate it from the Find My app. If you own an iPhone, the new AirPods Pro is an obvious choice but you do have others too!"
Sony WF-1000XM5, if you don't have time to watch a full review don't worry because we've got you covered and in this video we're going to tell you everything you need to know about the Sony wf-1000xm5 in five minutes first thing you need to know about these earbuds is that they are a lot more comfortable than the wf-1000xm4 not only are these smaller and lighter than its predecessor but it's only has also redesigned the internal structure of the ear tips and now that the ear tips are more flexible you don't have to jam and twist the earbuds into your ear to get a secure fit or a proper seal oh and if you got extra small ears don't worry because Sony has finally okay I lost them but Sony has finally included extra small ear tips for extra small ears so good for you wait why didn't we why did we pick a gray carpet and why did they send us the gray color along with the new ear tips comes improved isolation and on top of that the xm5 the earbuds now feature the best ANC performance out of any true Wireless earbud we have ever tested that's right according to our extensive objective testing process the xm5 earbuds do have better ANC performance than the xm4s the airpods pro Gen 2 and even the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro and if you want to see our full measurements then stay tuned for our ultimate review of the Sony wf-1000xm5 but if you're impatient then you can keep our results at soundguys.com now the xm5 earbuds also include improved touch controls that's right in the previous generation you had to choose between controlling either listening mode toggle or volume control in one earbud for the xm5 Sony has pulled a Hannah Montana and of giving you the best of both worlds meaning that you can control both listening modes and volume just from one earbud and you don't have to go into the app to customize the controls now the full list of touch control patterns are going to be available on our website or in this freeze frame in three two one speaking of customization like with most if not all Sony audio products the xm5s have great app support via the Sony headphones Connect app now downloading the app is key for getting firmware updates but it is also important for unlocking a lot of the earbuds features like adaptive sound control Ambient sound control DSE Extreme Audio upscaling and you're also going to need the app if you want to use Sony 360 reality audio which is the company's proprietary spatial audio technology next thing you need to know about the xm5s is that they've got great battery life now Sony claims that you can get eight hours on a single charge in up to 24 hours with a charging case but from our testing the xm5s actually exceeded Sony's claims and provided us with 9 hours and 32 minutes of playback that's enough battery life for a transatlantic flight between New York and London and you would still have extra battery for when you land in London the headphones also come with quick charging worth just three minutes of charging will give you about an hour's worth of playback now from our tests the three minute quick charging got us closer to 50 minutes of playback time which is still not bad if you need your earbuds for a quick workout now people complain that the xm4 has had too much bass emphasis and unfortunately the story isn't any better with the xm5s from hard testing the xm5s actually had a higher emphasis in the mid bass region which is why it sounds like cellos kick drums and bass since might sound a little louder than you'd expect and if you're a fan of EDM or hip-hop or you're someone like me who enjoys a little extra bass when pushing B then you're gonna love the xm5 but for those who prefer a little less low end then I recommend going into the headphones Connect app and turning down the clear bass slider in the EQ by a few notches now Sony also claims that the xm5's microphones is the best that's ever included in a pair of true wireless earbuds now this is apparently thanks to the six micro A3 per each side and also through a combination of AI processing and bone conduction technology which should provide better voice detection and therefore better filtering of outside noise while you're on a call unfortunately we were not able to properly test that because we were given a pre-production unit and the microphone on this one one is not good but we will be getting a production unit soon to test so again if you want to see our full mic test be sure to stay tuned for our ultimate review coming soon now if you own the wf-1000xm4 you're probably wondering should you upgrade to the xm5 well if you were someone like me who found the fit of the xm4 very uncomfortable then yes by all means upgrading the xm5 is a good idea but if you're thinking about upgrading based on sound quality or ANC performance I would hold off just because of how much an upgrade would cost you more on that later but you're probably also wondering are these any better than the airpods pro Gen 2 the answer is yes the xm5s do feature better ANC performance better software customization support and it plays nicely with Android devices but if you want the best out of the box sound quality and you want the most comfortable fit and you're an Apple user then yeah I'd actually still recommend the airpods pro Gen 2 over the xm5 and if you want to get your hands on the Sony wf-1000xm5 it will cost you around 300 US dollars to get these buds which is is quite a lot of cheddar for a pair of true Wireless noise canceling earbuds in fact at this price point the xm5s are more expensive than the airpods pro Gen 2 Samsung Galaxy buds 2 Pro and even the Google pixel buds Pro otherwise if you are looking for one of the best active noise cancellation true wireless earbuds then you won't be disappointed with the Sony wf-1000xm5 and that is time okay we did it that's pretty much it well if you enjoyed the format make sure to let us know in the comments down below or like and if you really did like the format make sure to hit like subscribe and I will see you guys in the next video happy listening,"The Sony WF-1000XM5 takes notes from the success of its predecessor and runs with it. Featuring a more comfortable design, outstanding ANC performance, and fantastic battery life, they have secured their place as one of the best noise canceling earbuds on the market."
Apple AirPods Max, the airpods max is without a doubt one of the most polarizing products apple has released in a while i've gotten a chance to use it as my daily driver for weeks and to this day i still don't know how to feel about them and in our first impressions article fellow sound guy adam had mixed feelings too don't get me wrong this is really well built and the headphone sounds great but it is very expensive and at 549 us dollars this costs double the price of some flagship headphones so why did apple build a pair of headphones that is so easy to love but just as easy to hate and why did apple build the airpods max and who is it for and before we get into that here's everything you need to know about the airpods max the airpods max is apple's first ever pair of over-ear bluetooth headphones sitting alongside the original airpods and the airpods pro it features a knit mesh band to reduce head pressure a stainless steel frame and ear pads made of a soft foam now not only are these ear pads magnetic and easily replaceable but they are also deep and the extra space in the ear cup helps evenly distribute the weight on your head and most importantly ensure a good seal for proper isolation speaking of which the isolation of the airpods max is good but you're probably not gonna have enough time to appreciate it because as soon as you put these headphones on the active noise cancellation turns on just like that and trust me when i say this is one of the best we've tested at sound guys beating out crowd favorites like the sony wh-1000xm4 and the bose noise cancelling headphone 700. now i live next to a construction site that works six days a week and these headphones drown it all out it's amazing now the airpods max actually sound pretty good and if you're a fan of electronic or hip hop music you'll appreciate its low end emphasis which allows kick drums and sub bass lines to cut through a mix it also features a slight d emphasis between the mid to high frequencies which helps get rid of any unwanted resonances from symbols and horns however this sound signature also reduces the detail in sounds like high-pitched vocals and instruments and of course this wouldn't be an apple audio product without the h1 chip now this special chip unlocks features that are exclusive to ios users such as instant pairing stable connection performance spatial audio audio sharing and even multi-device switching so we know the airpods max is well designed feels good and sounds good but it isn't the end-all be-all of bluetooth headphones there is just as much to criticize as there is to love about the airpods max and i'm going to go over all of this by first addressing who the airpods max was not designed for if you're an audiophile who thinks that it's 549 price tag is going to give you high-end sound quality think again and the biggest reason why this isn't designed for audio files has to do with codecs now in the context of the airpods max its issue is that it only supports apple aac aac doesn't always work the way you want it to on android and that's no fault of the codec aac is processor intensive and some android devices make some interesting choices as to how power is managed when the codec is in use so if you're on android trying to use an aac exclusive headphone like the airpods max expect hit or miss sound quality and connection performance depending on the device you're using plus most consumers who are buying the airpods max are likely listening to music through a service like spotify or apple music which only streams content up to kilobits per second and 256 kilobits per second respectively now while most people aren't probably going to tell the difference people who are really picky about their audio quality might have some complaints apple also doesn't offer any way to manually eq the airpods max all you get are a list of vaguely named presets in the ios settings app and among the presets are options like lounge and acoustic with no indication whatsoever as to how the sound is being adjusted by software if you're someone who prioritizes audio quality and customization above convenience i'm sorry to say but the airpods max isn't likely to please [Music] if you're somebody who needs a pair of headphones for the gym or to just shove in a backpack at a moment's notice you might want to skip these headphones as well now the airpods max are not waterproof or water resistant meaning that a little rain could be enough to ruin these headphones and even though its build quality is premium feeling i'm not entirely confident as to how it would fare from accidental drops let alone shoving it into your backpack with your keys inside now you may be thinking doesn't apple include a carrying case with the airpods max yeah but this which can only be described as a glorified leather power switch is what apple considers to be good enough protection for the airpods max and to be quite honest with you i don't see it really holding up years from now now before you dismiss the airpods max altogether hear me out i feel that there is a market for these headphones a very very specific market and that is the people who are willing to pay a premium for the little details apple does make intuitive products that just work and the airpods max is full of seemingly basic features that are just implemented way better than the competition and here are four of them for you to consider automatic switching if you're running the latest version of ipad os ios and mac os you'll never have to worry about manually switching between devices as long as you're using the same apple id across all your devices the airpods max will automatically detect where you're playing content from and switch accordingly spatial audio now spatial audio uses the gyroscope and accelerometer built into your iphone or ipad in tandem with the airpods max to create an immersive viewing experience as if you were watching a movie in a movie theater remember the good old days transparency mode there is no argument here apple's implementation of audio pass-through is among the best we have tested the button on the right ear cup activates transparency mode which uses its microphone array to amplify the sounds around you and it works fast so you're never going to miss any important notices like transit announcements intuitive controls while i wish apple used touch controls for playback such as on the side of the ear cups i still think the use of the digital crown from the apple watch was a smart move it's pretty straightforward to use as well these headphones were designed for apple users from the get go and no one expects this to be your first ever apple product and if you're on android yeah you could buy the airpods max but you're going to lack some essential features like software updates and reliable connection via aac [Music] apple understands that it has control over the future of technology and the airpods max is designed for people who will buy into its future and there are people who are buying into apple's vision and even now it's hard to get your hands on a pair of airpods max because it's back ordered i believe the airpods max is a brilliant piece of technology but am i going to buy my own pair probably not which is kind of surprising considering that these headphones were designed for people just like me i've been using apple products for years now both professionally and personally but the reason why i'm not eager to buy these headphones is because i don't believe that apple's vision of the future of bluetooth headphones is worth half a grand if you ask me i'm perfectly content with my three to four year old pair of bose quad comfort 35 mark iis those have served me well and they still served me well to this day but if you are somebody who does believe in apple's vision of the future and you have cash to burn and you are heavily integrated into the apple ecosystem then by all means hit checkout on your apple store cart you won't be disappointed [Music] you,"While the Apple AirPod Max is a great pair of headphones with best-in-class active noise canceling (ANC) and a good sound signature, it also has a few annoying quirks that make it very obviously an Apple product. If you live in the Apple ecosystem and already love your AirPods Pro, then the AirPods Max is more of the same just in a pair of over-ears."
Bose QuietComfort 45, here at sound guys we go through a lot of noise cancelling headphones and we've had some truly amazing products come through our doors in the last few years from the fan favorite sony wh-1000xm4 to the unexpected and expensive apple airpods max however even with these new headphones on the market i still use the four year old bose qc35 twos as my daily driver and sure it's an old product but it provides the best sound quality and fits for my needs so when bose announced that it was releasing the successor to my favorite headphones i was more than a little excited and now it's here four years later the bose quietcomfort45 but is it the product refresh we've been waiting for and should you buy this over the last generation model well let's find out [Music] the new bose qc45 headphones look pretty much identical to the previous model sporting the same plastic construction and matte finish albeit with more rounded edges throughout the frame and buttons weighing in at 240 grams the headset feels light and distributes its weight well on your head allowing for decent comfort over longer listening times the ear cups are large enough to suit most if not all ears and the synthetic leather pads create a seal to offer decent isolation while being breathable enough to prevent any noticeable heat buildup the headband is also adjustable and has padding on top for added comfort it features hinges near the ear cups allowing for the headphones to fold flat or up towards the headband for easier storage whether you're stuffing it in your backpack or into its included carrying case the bose qc45 sports the same controls as its predecessor on the right ear cup you'll find the power and bluetooth toggle switch underneath you've got the physical buttons for playback and volume control and while it's a nice inclusion i will say that the new rounded design of the buttons makes it too easy for my finger to slip and accidentally press the wrong one and what's next to the controls why yes that is a usbc port a very welcome upgrade from the bose qc35 twos which uses a micro usb connector an action button is located on the back side of the left ear cup which allows you to toggle between different anc modes and summon your voice assistant of choice and below the button is a 2.5 millimeter jack which allows for wired listening via the included 2.5 to 3.5 millimeter audio cable the design of the bose qc45 isn't anything groundbreaking but that's not necessarily a bad thing the qc35 ii was already comfortable and i'm glad that this new pair of headphones doesn't try to reinvent the wheel with these headphones bose is really telling us that if it ain't broke don't fix it and i'd wish they'd listen to themselves more on that later [Music] these headphones may not look new but that's because most of the upgrades are under the hood the bose qc45 now features bluetooth 5.1 for better range up to 9 meters before your connection starts to drop this means that you can listen to music while you're in your room and then quickly pop over to the kitchen or another room without the connection dropping out the qc45 also supports bluetooth multi-point allowing for two devices to be connected at any given time this allows anyone to switch easily between a laptop and a phone regardless of the platform unfortunately like the previous generation the bose qc45 doesn't support aptx or any higher bitrate codecs however it does support sbc and aac and you aren't likely to notice any issues when connecting to the headphones the bose qc45 can be customized using the bose music app for both ios and android however it doesn't offer that many features you can pretty much just rename the headphones manage devices adjust how much of yourself you can hear during calls and toggle between noise cancelling modes which the action button already takes care of we would have liked to see bose include eq controls because as things currently sit that is an issue i personally love the sound of the bose qc35 ii and so i was excited to see what bose would do with the qc45 and let's just say i got my hopes up a little too much it's not that the headset sounds bad it sounds line up pretty well with our consumer target curve which is a measure of what we think sounds good to most people however there is a noticeable overemphasis in the high end which makes sounds like symbols and high octave instruments sound much louder than they do in the original mix additionally because the emphasis in the highs so stark bass tends to feel underemphasized and lackluster in comparison leading to some to crank the volume up just to hear it and some people might like that but i'm not one of them normally you just drop the three to ten kilohertz region down a few decibels in your equalizer but oops you can't because this feature is not available in the bose music app so you're stuck with this unless your phone or music app has a built-in eq to mess with it's a shame because if you compare the frequency response of the bose qc45 to its predecessor you can see that the bose qc35 ii lines up more closely to our target and it kind of feels like bose took a step backward when tuning the successor to the quietcomfort series fortunately the bose qc45 boasts improved noise cancellation compared to previous models it does an excellent job at cancelling external noise with anc on airplane engine homes will sound around 1 8 as loud noises in the mid and high frequencies are also dulled including light chatter and traffic i wouldn't crown it the king of anc however it does hold up with other anc headphones from sony and apple in fact our tests show that the bose qc45 actually has an advantage when it comes to attenuating high frequency sounds although this only really works well when cancelling out droning noises the bose qc45 uses a four mic array to help isolate your voice and has a noise rejecting algorithm to filter out external moves from our testing the microphone sounds okay and according to the poll on our website readers seem to agree you'll get away with using it for zoom meetings and phone calls however it's not going to be replacing a dedicated studio mic any time soon the noise rejection is also pretty good which helps when you need to take a call in a louder environment such as the workplace or even a coffee shop if you're someone like me who wears their headphones for most of the day you're in luck our battery tests clock the bose qc45 at around 24 hours and 50 minutes with active noise cancelling enabled this is more than enough for even the longest international flights if you're lucky enough to be flying right now if you do run out of juice it only takes 2.5 hours to fully charge the headphones and just 15 minutes of charging gives you up to three hours of playtime [Music] so the question stands should you buy the bose qc45 this holiday season probably not and don't get me wrong it's comfortable has great noise cancellation decent sound and a decent mic system but it doesn't have enough going for it over its predecessor which is a shame because i've been rooting for a product refresh since 2017. right now the bose qc45 is available for 329 us dollars but you can get the bose qc35 twos for 80 dollars less and it has arguably better sound quality you do trade the usb c port for micro usb which is a little annoying but for the price it's hard to justify the bose qc45 at the end of the day the bose qc45 isn't a bad product but after four years i'd be lying if i said i didn't expect more and i don't see much value in upgrading to the new model when my old pair of bose qc352s does basically the exact same job for much less [Music],"The Bose QuietComfort 45 has all the parts to be a great ANC headset, but it doesn't quite have the finish. Sound quality isn't all that great, even if the ANC is among the best in class."
Bose QuietComfort 35 II, [Music] so we already reviewed the QC 35 s so why bother with the series - what's so new about them that warrants a serious - anyway well for one these have a new hardware button that lets you activate your favorite assistant and no we're not talking about big speed we're talking about the Google assistant I'm Adam Alina and this is our review for the QC 35 S series - now it just wouldn't be a tech review without a good old fashioned unboxing so when you open the box you're greeted with this oddly shaped but sturdy carrying case opening it up reveals the headphones nicely tucked away inside it's like boses trying to show off just how flexible and ultra packable these are right from the start along with the headphones you get a micro USB charging cable and an audio cable on the inside of the packaging it tells you to download the bose connects plus app in order to get started so let's dig into that when you open up the app it'll first try and find the headphones and then ask you to swipe them down in order to finish pairing so it's pretty cool especially since the process is helped along by a small voice egging you on in your ear telling you if you're connected or if it's still searching after you select your language and pick a nickname like this one you'll get to the Google assistant setup which lets you toggle having you notifications right allowed into your ear along with a dedicated google help page specifically for the product then you can ask it questions just like you would if you activated Google on your phone except it's not it's much quicker so as soon as you press the button the headphones will start listening to what you have to say and then you can ask a question or give you a command normally with headphones that have this functionality you'd have to hold it down for a second wait for the beep beep and then Google or Syria to pop up on your phone and then you can ask the question you're left to waiting for that verification that the button actually worked it's instant like as soon as you press the button the headphones start listening to you and then you can either ask your question how are the Knicks d'un or give your command remind me at 11:30 a.m. to tell Joe Hindi that I named the headphones after him the Knicks are in 9th place in the Eastern Conference with no wins and one loss one game behind them check your reminder for 11:30 a.m. is ready tell Joe Hindi that I named the headphones after him you're not left waiting for any confirmation beeps or anything like that before you speak to it obviously you do have to wait a second or two for the reply to get back to you after it's been sent to your phone but that's fine the whole process is still really quick you can also just tap the button to have the assistant tell you the time or read you any new notifications like the ones that I have from all my friends you don't have new notifications right now now the Google assistant isn't the only new feature with the series too in the Bose connect plus app you can remap the action button on the left ear cup to control the active noise-cancelling which now comes in three different levels high low or completely off and don't worry you'll still be able to access the Google assistant by holding down the multifunction button on the right ear cup for a second if you choose to do this so you get the best of both worlds now you're probably wondering well what if I have an iOS device and if you do have an iOS device you too can have the best of both worlds kind of you'll have to download the Google assistant app on your iPhone in order for the action button to pull it up and then you can access Siri by holding down the multifunction button but something tells me that you're not downloading the Google assistant if you're happy with Siri but that's another conversation as far as connection goes these are just as strong and consistent as the original version of these I had no problem with connection strength whether my phone was in my pocket or across the room so extreme range testing aside these only skipped on me three times and about a week of usage which isn't bad at all and that connection strength also applied to calls and I had no issues here so if call quality is something that's important to you these won't let you down so at this point in the review you're probably wondering why we spent so much time on the Google assistant and the connection aspect of these headphones and that's because when compared to the original bose qc25 s this button is really the only thing that's different about it this little action button that controls the assistant or the three levels of active noise-cancelling is the only significant improvement everything else from the sound quality to the build quality is more or less the same but in case you missed our original review we'll dig into that now so design is easy because like we already mentioned the new action button is the only thing that's different about these in the original QC 35s these are still the same smart-looking minimal pair of headphones they maintain the slim profile of the originals and also the comfort level as well these are considered one of the most comfortable pairs of headphones on the market and for good reason you can wear these for hours without ever feeling like you have to take them off to let your ears breathe they're also super durable and can be bent and twisted in a bunch of ways so if you have to really jam them in your bag on your way out the door you can do so with a clear conscience but you should still probably use the included carrying case you know just in case besides the action button and multifunction buttons that we already mentioned you'll also get the volume up and volume down buttons as well as a power switch on the right ear cup you'll see that these charge via microUSB on the bottom of one ear cup and even have a 3.5 millimeter input on the other so you can hardwire these to your phone if you still have that option battery life also hasn't changed between these in the previous models you'll still get about 20 hours of constant playback which is about three or four coast-to-coast trips in the US it's not bad in our testing we got exactly 15 hours and 46 minutes of playback on about 80% so unless you're trying to blow your ears off playing these on max volume you shouldn't have any problems with battery life so first things first nothing about the sound quality has changed here even though they now have the Google assistant and Android Oreo now supports L DAC app X and AB Dex HD codecs support for Bluetooth streaming you won't find any of that here these only support AAC and SBC and you need to detangle with Bluetooth codecs so on one side doesn't support it they default back to the standard which is SBC SBC is the same as the original so nothing new here now that doesn't mean that these sound bad the average person will probably find these more than great but if you consider yourself an audiophile that's one aspect you're gonna have to suck it up with lows are definitely still given preference over everything else but on the bright side that weird rattle that used to occur in songs with heavy bass on the first generation is gone so thankfully they fixed that that said these aren't any less bass heavy each bass kick in the song we just haven't met yet by Russ shook my eyes just a little bit when they were on max volume I'm sure some people will find this great but I not still at least the rattling is gone mids are just as clean as they've always been with the vocals coming through loud and clear I was hoping that there would be just a little more detail in the background instruments of some songs but it seems to be the same as the previous model which isn't a bad thing since those sounded fine but one could always hope these also do a great job at staying away from harshness and the highs you won't get some of that same Erina Sand spatial positioning that you'll notice when listening to open back headphones of a similar price the high hats and cymbals and Billy Joel's the Zanzibar sound a little flat and don't really have the exhilarating effects that I know them to have oh yeah and about that active noise cancellation Bose has always had top-of-the-line ANC but now we can actually show you just how good that really is of course this isn't scientific but it should give you a general idea of how these sound when the ANC is turned on so just like Chris Thomas did in his video explaining isolation we took a fake head stuffed the microphone in it and then recorded pink noise with and without the headphones graphing the results and subtracting one from the other gives us this graph everything in blue and green was pretty much canceled out which shows you just how good these are is it nears the twenty decibel line but we can go even further and show you more or less how these will sound in a few different scenarios so first is a coffee shop and it's probably best if you put on headphones here [Music] ii was on a random street here in portland and third was in another coffee shop because I'm clearly addicted [Music] so in the end these are the same headphones as they were before they're just a little bit better now thanks to the active noise-cancelling profiles and the addition of the Google assistant now the ANSI is still top-notch and one of the best you'll get at any price point and because basically nothing else has changed about these headphones they're still just as sleek and as comfortable as they were before of course we're always going to wish that sound quality was better but these are far from the worst sounding pair of Bose headphones I've ever heard music sounds fine and you're not paying for the sound quality really let's be honest you're paying for the features a price tag of three hundred and forty nine dollars will deter a lot of people from buying these and rightfully so but let's be real these are still gonna fly off the shelves we're giving the bose qc25 series two headphones and eight point six out of ten and that pretty much does it for our review of the QC 35 series - thanks for watching if you want to know more about any of the other product to review make sure to check out sound guys comm but while you're here subscribe to the YouTube channel if you haven't already and sign up to our newsletter so you can stay up to date with all the newest reviews and audio news here at sound guys links to all of that down in the description I'm Adam Malina I'll see you later,"The Bose QuietComfort 35 II have some of the best noise canceling in the business, and they're regarded as one of the most comfortable headsets around. With a great default frequency response, travel-friendly design, and solid mic system, there's plenty to love about the QC 35 II."
Sennheiser ACCENTUM Wireless, with as many noise cancelling headphone releases this October you might have missed the Sennheiser as senum Wireless if you give me 5 minutes here's why Bose should be afraid of these $180 headphones the Sennheiser entum wireless headphones get a lot right and a lot more than you're probably thinking $180 is going to get you for starters Sennheiser paid very close attention to reducing the mass of their headphones and even though these are mainly plastic it's actually kind of nice it's a lot easier to get comfortable with headphones that don't have a lot of heft to them pads are nice and deep and the band is flexible enough to meet your head where it's at however there's not all good news this leatherette uh not so great for people who wear glasses and I say that because this type of material doesn't do a great job of recreating a seal if you interrupt it with something like a glass's arm most people won't ever really need to care about this so much but it is something to be aware of especially given some of the other shortcomings I'll get to a little bit later the Sennheiser entum uses Bluetooth 5.2 which is a bit of a bummer meaning that it may not get the Le audio features later on down the road however it does also allow you the use of SBC AAC apex apex HD and a few other upgrades for telephony now these can be used Wireless or wired but Chris you say there's no headphone jack yes I know this USBC Port not just for charging it can handle audio over USB as well which is something that Bose headphones cannot do and an increasing number of A&C headphones will do so even if you're not satisfied with the wireless performance of these headphones you can just grab a USBC cable and go from there assuming your Source device supports it battery life great we tested it at 46 hours Sennheiser advertises 50 it's got an 800 milliamp battery so even if you charge at normal speeds you should be able to get a few hours of of listening time for over a couple minutes so how does the Sennheiser Centum wireless sound well they sound pretty good actually especially for 180 bucks but there's a couple of foibles in there that you know may give you a little bit of a pause but you can EQ the worst ones away for example there's a spike in the subbase which you can tone down using the ciser smart control app or the EQ app of your choice I turned it down about 3 or 4 DB you may do less that's okay the more interesting hiccup is the underemphasis at 4 khz which is a bit of a drop you're not really going to hear that as much I mean if you're looking for it yeah but in general if you're looking listening to tunes on the subway or in an airplane or in a noisy environment it's really not going to be much of a deal it's one of those things that looks really scary on a chart but isn't so bad in real life if you're looking for Top Flight A&C uh well these ain't it despite the fact that the Sennheiser Centum Wireless goes Toe to Toe tow with a lot of the Top Flight headphones on the market the truth of the matter is is that their A&C is a little bit subpar even if it's good enough for most people that said being able to reduce 75% of loudness about your outside surroundings isn't bad it's just not as good as some other headphones and probably the most disappointing aspect of these headphones is the microphone performance if you're on a zoom call or if you're in a quiet environment microphone works great the two M's mics with beam forming make sure that your voice is heard fairly clearly and the frequency response shows that there's uh some tailoring going on to help your voice sound better however this headset has some noise rejection issues especially if you're in a very windy area but if you'd like to hear for yourself how these perform go to the website we've got lots of samples so what does the Sennheiser accum have to offer over the Bose quiet Comfort headphones well a lot really uh aside from the price tag which is just over half of Bose's headphones you're getting USBC audio Bluetooth 5.2 with m multipoint a much more fleshed out app little bit lighter headphones and better sound quality by a lot if you ask me I would pick these nine times out of 10 now there are a few situations where you would want the Bose headphones for example if you really need that extra noise cancelling but at under $200 I can't really complain a whole heck of a lot of about that if you're looking for Budget alternatives to the senzer centm wireless you're going to be looking for a long time and truth be told I can't think of anything off the top of my head that would work very well in this instance for example the closest I can come is the Sony whch 720n and that doesn't compare the sound quality is not as good even if thec is comparable and and the price is hard to argue with but still would you rather pay $130 for headphones that you're not really very happy about or $180 on headphones that you are really happy about and uh if my fake skin watches reading correctly that's 5 minutes thank you for joining us here at sound guys and as always happy listening,"For a set of ANC headphones that cost roughly half of what the top-end competitors do, there's a lot to like about the Sennheiser ACCENTUM Wireless headphones. However, the ANC is a little on the weak side, and the microphone doesn't reject noise all too well. Still, this is one of the best value buys on the market at the moment."
Beyerdynamic DT 990 PRO, if you're an aspiring video producer music Creator or streamer you might want to keep the buer dynamic dt990 Pros on your radar here's everything you need to know about them in 5 minutes first these are a Content creation machine not necessarily for casual listening by that I mean these are not made for music listening at first you may see a lot of people Fetch and moan about how they sound a little bit different than their highend headphones but that's intentional there's a bump in the 120 HZ range and an emphasis up from 2 to 6 khz this is meant to help content creators identify really annoying sounds in their mix in either vocals or atmospheric effects once you hear these things it's a lot easier to tone them down and make the mix sound good additionally these are quite a lot larger than your normal headphones with this giant earpad right here it can encircle most of your ear if not all of it even if you have a larger head size fire dnamic did themselves a huge favor by making all of their ear pads interchangeable from the dt770 pros to the 880 Pros to the 990 Pros if you find one that fits on one it will fit on the rest the velour padding is also a huge Boon to anybody who wears glasses because it means that they won't catch on the leatherette it your arms will just slide through the larger ear cups are are very very good because they allow your ears not to be compressed we use our outer ears to determine spatial cues like where a sound is coming from and it's very important in mixes and games and movies to be able to understand what's happening around you if you have headphones that push your outer ears in too much you might lose some of these spatial cues and your audio quality will sound off to you that's why having such a deep ear cup is important because it lets your ears breathe and it lets them work how they're supposed to now if you're mixing content or creating anything you're going to be wearing headphones for hours at a time that's why the velour coating to a somewhat firm padding is important Additionally the thicker padding at the top of the band and the relative light weight mean that this isn't going to dig into your skull unless you really torque it down by the way don't do that additionally every part of this headphone can be replaced from the padding to the band to the yolks to the drivers to the pads all of this if you break something you can fix it it'll cost you a little bit but it's worth it if you are used to having a professional tool for your job now these are open-backed headphones they're not going to block any noise from the outside world and you should hear everything that's going on around you and if you're streaming you have to pay attention not to make the levels too high otherwise they'll get picked up on your mic these are not monitoring headphones that honor would belong to the biod Dynamics dt770 Pros that Harley is wearing right now right in front of me because those are closed back and they won't leak any sound these are mixing headphones not monitoring headphones now the big advantage of these headphones is that you can use them at work or home and I say that because these are very easy to equalize remember those two ranges that I talked about earlier by using a parametric equalizer you can make pretty broad cuts to make your sound a lot better for music consumption now these are somewhat higher impedence so you might find that your computer may not be able to get you a usable level right out of the box but that's really okay it doesn't take a lot of juice to get these cans up to where they're supposed to be so an interface like the Scarlet 2i2 or even a cheap headphone amp should be able to handle the job now as these are considered audio file headphones you might expect them to be quite expensive but the truth is is that these hover between $150 and $200 depending upon where you live these are an excellent buy and sure they may not be as cheap as the Sony mdr7506 but they are much higher performers and they are much better at the task that they're given because well you know these are mixing headphones they're not monitoring headphones big difference it's no surprise that forms of this headphone have been around since 1988 I mean why mess with a good thing right hey guys really quickly before this video ends I just want to address one more question which is how does the be dynamic dt990 Pro compared to the newer dt9 100 Pro X well seeing these are the newer version the dtt900 Pro X offers a few improvements over its predecessor including a more comfortable build lower impedance meaning that you won't need an amp to use these headphones and according to our lab measurements the DT 90000 Pro X also better lines up with our preference curve for Studio headphones but that's enough for me let's throw it back to Chris to end the video take it away all right and if I'm not mistaken that's 5 minutes thank you for joining us here today on sound guys and happy listening,"For less than $200, it's not hard to understand why the DT 990 PRO is considered to be a classic pair of cans for audio producers and music lovers alike. If you don't want to splurge on Beyerdynamic's updated line of DT PRO X headsets, then this is an absolute steal."
Sony WH-1000XM5, the Sony wh-1000xm5 is one of the hottest noise canceling headphones on the market but before you go out and buy a pair for yourself here are five things you need to know about Sony's Flagship headphones let's get the most obvious point out of the way the Sony wh-1000xm5 is undoubtedly one of the best noise canceling headphones available right now for more testing these wh-1000xm5 shows a noticeable improvement from its predecessor reducing the sound of Planes Trains and Street noise to around 1 8 their original perceived loudness not only that our testing shows that Sony's Flagship is better in blocking low frequency sounds when compared to the Bose QuietComfort 45 both 700 and of course the Sony wh-1000xm4 we actually did an in-depth review of the xm5 noise cancellation a while back and in that video you can even hear how the headphones sound with ANC on so be sure to check out that video after this one the second thing you need to know about the Sony wh-1000xm5 is that it has good but not great sound quality here at sound guys we compare the sound signature of all the headphones we test to our in-house curve which is a frequency response we think sounds good to most people from our testing we found that the wh-1000xm5 tends to overemphasize bass notes now while that might be great for EDM and track fans it ends up dulling higher frequency sounds such as strings instruments horns and more Auto soprano vocals the headphones also feature added emphasis on treble frequencies which can help compensate for the over-emphasized low end however this simply means that if you turn the volume up symbol Shimmer hi-hats and sharp attacks from snare drums May stand out a little too much in the mix fortunately you can adjust some of these settings using the built-in EQ in Sony's headphone Connect app alternatively if you don't want to Tinker with the settings yourself we actually have a downloadable EQ preset which you can use with the wavelet app for Android which is available in the full review on our website the wh-1000xm5 is compatible with Sony's robust mobile app which offers users a lot of ways to customize their listening experience as I alluded to earlier the Sony headphones Connect app allows you to create your own custom EQ presets to suit your listening experience if you want our recommendation we'd suggest starting by lowering the clear base slider two notches and then not going more than six notches in any direction with the other controls the app also gives you access to set up Sony 360 reality audio customized controls and of course allows you to update the firmware you can even tell the app to prioritize connection stability over streaming quality or vice versa another neat feature of the Sony headphones Connect app is adaptive sound control which allows you to adjust the active noise cancellation based on either your action or your location however enabling this function may require some data collection which we have covered in a previous video moving on the Sony wh-1000xm5 features an excellent microphone system its 8 mic array utilizes an AI noise rejection algorithm resulting in very good call Quality over Zoom or over the phone from our testing the microphone is particularly good at rejecting outside noise and we have a suite of recorded mic samples in the full review on our website which you should definitely check out after watching this video while the Sony wh-1000xm5 certainly excels in the basics these headphones aren't for everyone it doesn't have an IP rating meaning that it is not rated for any dust or water resistance so if you live in a place like rainy Vancouver or you're planning on bringing these on a hike you may want to think twice before accidentally ruining your near 400 US dollar investment also because these headphones don't have an IP rating we don't recommend you buy them for working out prolonged exposure to sweat could damage the internals not to mention stink up the padding and nobody wants that now if you want to read our full review and learn about how we test headphones be sure to visit us at soundguys.com also let us know what you want to see next in the comments down below and while you're down there be sure to like subscribe and hit the Bell icon to be notified when we upload next I'm Harlem around with sound guys and until next time happy listening [Music],"The predecessors to the Sony WH-1000XM5 were king of the hill, and this new headphone takes that crown. With new drivers, features, and design, the Sony WH-1000XM5 is an intriguing set of headphones among the flagship active noise canceling (ANC) devices on the market. It excels in travel or at the office, in particular."
HD 560S, the Sennheiser HD 560s are some of the best audio file headphones on a budget released in the last 10 years here's everything you need to know about them in 5 minutes weighing it at 240 G this set of headphones is exceptionally light among the audio file category it has really large plush ear cups and they have angled drivers to make sure that they don't actually touch your ears and mess with your perception of space the extra padded band means that these are going to be a for several hours per listening session you can adjust them at will to fit a quite large head or an even tiny one what's most important here is that these pads are uh so big that they are not likely to touch your ears and mess with your illusion of space that's going to help with things like Sound Stage and anything mixed for movie content or game content where you need to be able to understand your position relative to to the world though these are wired only you don't actually need any extra equipment so an amp or a dock is probably not necessary these have a fairly low power requirement so your computer's onboard amplifier should be more than up to the task however the cable is nonstandard plugging in on the side you have to twist it to get it in and out see how easy that is and it uses a 2.5 mm trrs connector we recommend not pulling this out very often simply because it's kind of a pain to get it back in it's very easy to shove it into the wrong area it doesn't always go into the slot one of the weirder things about this cable is that it terminates in a 1/4 in plug now that's not really a problem interfaces like the Scarlet 2i2 have this uh but if you're going to be using anything with a mini plug you're going to need to use this dongle which we would hope to see less of especially now that we have threaded adapters for example the by dnamic dt990 pro has this unscrew the adapter and your golden sennheiser's open back design means that a lot of the music that you'll be listening to through these headphones will sound a lot more natural than it would on a set of closed-back headphones as far as sound quality goes some of you may not like it but that's just because of the way Studio headphones are generally tuned this follows a lot of the same characteristics first the base is what we would call Flat as in it is not emphasized over other ranges of frequencies that's really fine that's good for your content because it means that you can either equalize it to what you want or you can hear it as it was mixed at the studio now treble is emphasized just a little bit which means that you'll be able to hear smaller sounds and mixes like a tack of a guitar pick a drum head uh or even a kick drum stringed and wood instruments also will have a few more characteristics that are easier to pick out same with vocals unfortunately what this does end up sounding like often is that your music is too treble heavy but again because the whole area below 1 khz is so flat it's very very easy to equalize if you have the time and again if you want to use something like a parametric equalizer you won't have to Tinker a whole heck of a lot in order to add a base shell for example just remember to use the correct amount of preamp gain and if you are going to equalize you may want to use something like an interface or uh an amplifier to make sure that you have enough Headroom to begin with it's not a need it's just something that's nice to have though these are incredibly unexciting headphones they are as basic as they get for Wired only these are quite exciting because of the price at $199.95 5 MSRP these slot in quite nicely with a lot of uh heavier hitters in the two to three to $400 category so if you're just starting out and you want to get your toes wet this is a great way to not spend too much money getting into the hobby sure you may buy something a little bit better or something that may fit your taste uh later on down the road but this is about as sure as a bet you're going to get if you're looking for Alternatives uh you're going to have to Shell out a bit of money Sennheiser has a number of different options in their stable but a lot of them are much more expensive than the HD 560s for example even the cost cut drop version of the HD 650 the HD 6xx is still about $200 online if it's on sale and other options like the uh HD 660 S2 and the HD 650 are all above $400 nearing uh 500 in order to save yourself some money stick with the HD 560 s's it's a great entryway into the hobby all right if I'm not mistaken that's time thanks for joining us here at sound guys and happy listening,"The Sennheiser HD 560S is a rock-solid choice if you're aiming to grab a set of headphones that live by the computer but don't break the bank. They're not going to make you forget about ultra high-end headphones, but they offer extremely good performance for the price at the tradeoff of build materials being a little cheaper."
Beats Studio3 Wireless, [Music] so active noise-cancelling headphones like the Bulls QC 35s and the qc25 s before them have basically been running the game when it comes to Bluetooth headphones even Sony's now in the mix with their own line of great ANC wireless headphones but there's one company that's mysteriously absent from this conversation beats by dre at least until now the company now has the studio three wireless headphones with active noise-cancelling but are they better than their competitors and should you spend your money to get them let's find out so I have a lot of negative things to say about these headphones so let's start off with the positives I like the colors all jokes aside beats really do have a wide variety of colors but something that I do actually like is the soft matte plastic that these are made out of and the way they feel in the hand they're not as fingerprint prone as you might expect the plush ear cups are also really comfortable and I was able to wear these for quite some time without my ears hurting it does get a little hot after a while but that's to be expected another nice aspect of these headphones is how compact they get when you fold them crucial for travel I just wish that the ear cups would rotate 90 degrees out so that when you're wearing them around your neck they don't feel awkward and weird the adjustable band and hinges are the only visible part of the headphones made of metal but I can't speak to their longevity as I've only had them for a few weeks but so far no problems so if you're wondering why I don't like these now is a good time to pay attention because even though I do really like the plush ear cups and they feel great on my ears whatever plastic they use on the bottom of the headband here is really grippy and always pulls my hair not in a way that's really painful or anything but it's just super annoying like when I take these off my head is relieved which shouldn't be the case with headphones the button on the left ear cup is painfully and unapologetically plastic and sounds like a cheap piece of plastic every time you click the button reminding you just how cheap and plasticky that button is on top of that the plastic construction does not inspire confidence at all now to be fair something like the QC 35 headphones are also made entirely of plastic but they're also super flexible like really flexible the studio 3 Wireless feel significantly more stiff and although I twisted and turned them a little bit during testing you could feel the headphone straining against a pressure which is kind of problematic if you're gonna be tossing these into the bottom of a backpack luckily they do come with a hard shell carrying case that I would recommend you using if you decide to pick these up now they do have a few different buttons but despite the symmetrical look of these headphones all of the buttons that you need are on the left side save for the power button which is down here on the right side but that's it so on the bottom of the left ear cup is a 3.5 millimeter input so you can plug in the included audio cable which before you ask no it doesn't end in a lightning connector and no it doesn't come with a dongle because reasons clicking the B logo on the left ear cup once will pause or play the music twice will skip to the next song and three times will return to a previous song you can also hold down the button to access Siri or Google assistant and there's also volume controls above and below that button moving over to the right ear cup you'll find that it looks exactly the same but does absolutely nothing it's just a logo then at the very bottom is a microUSB port for charging which isn't USB type-c because reasons now on the bright side these do have class 1 Bluetooth and Apple's very own w1 chip so connecting to your source device is a breeze and if you're in the Apple ecosystem you'll automatically be able to use them with all of your iCloud devices without needing to repair to each one which is still pretty useful if you're on Android you'll have to pair the good old fashioned way by opening up your Bluetooth settings but even that was pretty seamless surprisingly the connection was pretty strong regardless of which operating system you used now I'm pretty sure these are supposed to be better with iOS devices because of the w1 chip but half of my testing was done on the pixel 2 XL and I had no problems at all now I'm sure I'm not alone and saying that I watch a lot of YouTube and chances are at least 80% of you're watching this on youtube right now maybe more well good news the studio 3 Wireless have no delay on both iOS and Android when watching videos I guess this sucks if you're a huge fan of old kung fu movies but this is good news for the rest of us now these are active noise-cancelling which is kind of the point of getting these headphones you can turn the anc on or off by entering bluetooth settings if you have us device an Android you don't have this option but you do have the option to turn on or off AAC this forces the headphones to revert back down to the SBC codec though I'm not sure why you'd want to do that because it's lesser sound quality the headphones by default always have the active noise-cancelling turned on so it's good to know how to turn them off if you want to get the most out of your battery life so beats claims a battery life of 22 hours of constant playback with active noise-cancelling turned on and about 40 hours with active noise-cancelling turned off for reference the bull's QC 35 s promise about 20 hours of constant playback and our testing here we got 10 hours and 12 minutes with a hundred percent volume on the first run they also have a quick charging feature which gives you about three hours of playback for only 15 minutes on the charger which is really useful ok now let's talk sound because when it comes to headphones that I'm gonna be using for hours at a time on plane rides or commutes I really want three things one comfort which I already spoke about - battery life which these are actually pretty good and three sound quality if I'm taking a 20 hour plane ride chances are I'm gonna be spending a lot of that time staring out the window listening to my favorite bond every song you know like we all do and at that point I want to really be able to listen to my favorite songs you know I want good sound I don't want whatever these are now I'm sure I don't have to tell you that the studio 3 wireless headphones are bass heavy the lower frequencies are heavily emphasized to the detriment of basically everything else the one example I can point to which demonstrates this perfectly is the song never looked back by slow Club which starts off with some slow finger snaps that get overtaken significantly when the bass line comes in that really shouldn't happen the vocals that come in and out at about the same time also don't benefit from the bump and bass besides just an overall lack of clarity in the vocals the underlying melody has given way more presence than it should have so if you listen to the song this will be easy to understand but around 8 seconds into the song the main melody comes in with these headphones that secondary melody is more or less equal and output to the main melody the highs are just as bad and feel more like an afterthought the writing symbols during the course of the song cruel world by dint may are supposed to be rhythmic in the way that they overlap each other but they end up sounding instead like short high hats now I don't really consider myself a Beats hater you know I really enjoyed using the power beats threes because it felt like there was some thought put into their form and function you know as expensive as they were they were gym headphones and when I took them to the gym I had a good experience so to me that's a good product it doesn't feel that way with the studio three Wireless this feels like they kind of just haphazardly threw something together in the hopes of getting some of the market that's currently being ravaged by bose and sony they offer sounds significantly worse than both the bose qc25 s and the sony WH 1000 x mark twos the build feels like it would snap if you push them too hard and on top of that the active noise-cancelling is decent but it's not up to par with what Bose and Sony are doing right now now I'm usually a little more lenient with Beats products to be honest because I know they're gonna sell anyway but the studio three wireless headphones are just bad for a pair of headphones named studio I can't think of a worse sound signature to use in the studio just save your 350 bucks you don't need these and that should do it for a review of the Beats

great gadget, but was hard to justify for the original $350 USD price tag. Today, however, you can easily find this headset for less than $200 USD, making it a much more appealing, albeit outdated, option."
Nothing Ear (2), two years after the release of the year one nothing is back with the second generation ear 2. at first glance it doesn't seem like much has really changed from the first generation but the truth is there's actually more than meets the eye I'm Harley Moran of the sound guys and in this video we are going to be reviewing the nothing ear 2. [Music] but nothing year two features the same design language as its predecessor complete with the semi-translucent body for both the case and the earbuds stepping Beyond Aesthetics however there are actually some noteworthy upgrades with the ear too for starters both earbuds and the charging case are more durable than the last generation while the nothing ear ones boast an ipx4 water resistance rating for the earbuds the nothing ear 2 Sports and ip54 rating for The Buds and an ip55 water and dust resistant rating for the case speaking of which the second generation case is slightly smaller than the last Model and this allows the case to fit relatively well in a Gene's pocket creating only a minor pocket bulge as for the earbuds themselves they feel light in your ears and you don't have to shove them into your ears in order to get a decent seal nothing ear took also comes with a variety of silicone ear tips to help ensure the best fit possible besides feeling light the earbuds also feel quite secure in the ear and I never felt as if the buds were going to fall out when moving my head quickly or if I was out for a walk on a windy day and like the first generation the ear 2 also features in-ear detection which automatically pauses your music when you remove the buds and resumes when you put them back in to control the buds there's nothing Gear 2 uses pressure sensitive stems to trigger commands including playback controls and to toggle between ANC and transparency mode and you can customize the controls via the nothing X mobile app based on our testing these stem controls work fine although our reviewer Jasper found that sometimes playback will pause when trying to switch between listening modes also because the stems are pretty short some people's earlobes may be a little too big and might get in the way of the stem making it a little hard to operate so while the triggers work for the most part you may counter the occasional glitch here and there overall the design of the nothing year 2 doesn't reinvent the wheel but it certainly builds upon the strong foundations laid out by its predecessor thanks to some minor improvements in terms of connectivity then I think ear 2 supports a modest number of codecs it may not support the high quality ldac or aptex Bluetooth codecs however it can transmit up to 24 bit 192 kilohertz audio via the old HDC 5.0 codec it's not a common Bluetooth codec but Android 10 and above can't support it of course the ear 2 also supports the standard SBC codec and AAC for use with iPhones as I mentioned previously the ear 2 can be controlled using the nothingx app for both Android and iOS and this gives you access to controlled customization and equalizer personalized ANC and sound profiles and software updates the app also lets you enable new features such as low lag mode for gaming and you can now have the ability to connect two devices which lets you for example switch from your laptop to your phone if you get a call so we know that the nothing ear 2 looks good and supports a decent array of Bluetooth codecs but does it sound any good well for the price yeah our testing shows that the nothing year 2 has an out of the box frequency response that's tuned in a relatively consumer friendly fashion however notice that parts of the upper portion of the frequency spectrum are quite emphasized particularly around five kilohertz the frequency response of the ear 2 is about 10 decibels louder than our head phone Target curve this means that instruments that fall around this frequency like symbols the top end of electric guitars or synths at high octaves may cause fatigue after long listening periods as well as the boosted upper mid-range we also noticed a mildly exaggerated low end and a slight dip between 400 Hertz and one kilohertz which combined might make music sound a little one-dimensional fortunately you do have the option to customize your sound via the nothing X apps built-in equalizer the only caveat is that nothing's EQ doesn't tell you what frequency ranges are being affected for bass mid and treble sounds still it's better than no EQ and we'd recommend turning down the treble by a few notches to compensate for the high end emphasis now while you're in the app you will also notice that nothing offers a feature to create a personalized sound profile our reviewer Jasper didn't find this particularly useful from his experience the custom sound profile made some of his favorite songs sound worse by further emphasizing those High mids this essentially made hi-hat symbols sound more like thin Splash symbols while also exaggerating vocal sibilance give it a try if you want but it's definitely not a game changer besides having good sound quality the nothing ear 2 also features active noise cancellation and you can even adjust the intensity of the ANC or use a personalized ANC profile via the nothingx app however like with the custom sound profile we didn't find the personalized ANC feature particularly helpful we use the highest intensity for our ANC tests and looking at our results the earbuds do a good job of attenuating low pitch noises with ANC enabled based on our measurements the nothing year 2 doesn't exactly reach the 40 decibels of noise canceling that's advertised by the company now the ANC performance does get close to this claim but only at the very edge of our hearing where noise isn't really a big issue anyway nevertheless the ear 2 will do a decent job in attenuating chatter rumbles and hums but don't expect it to fully drown out traffic noise or construction sounds when you're listening Outdoors when it comes to microphone quality then nothing ear 2 actually does a good job in capturing your voice and then filtering out external noise when speaking in an office or on the street although if you're Outdoors on a windy day the ear two can struggle with filtering out noise and not your voice to hear what the nothing ear 2 microphone sounds like in different environments and to see our full measurement results be sure to read our full review on soundguys.com moving on to battery life the nothing year 2 actually performs quite well our battery test showed that the earbuds lasted a little over six hours which is slightly above average and considering the fact that ANC is a real battery hog the ear 2's battery life is good for the price in addition the case has an impressive four or five extra charges on tap when it is time to charge you can take advantage of the nothing year 2's fast charging which yields up to 8 hours of battery life for the case with just 10 minutes of charging you can even charge the case using the included USB C to C cable or by putting the case on a Qi wireless charging pad so now the big question should you buy the nothing ear 2 well considering it's 149 US dollar price tag then nothing YouTube is actually a really good deal it fits well is water and dust resistant has good sound quality decent ANC performance and good app support now it's definitely not perfect the pressure sensitive pads for squeeze controls aren't the most reliable and the delays between command and execution may be under point for some however you'd be hard-pressed to find a better pair of true wireless earbuds around the same price but what do you think about the nothing here too do you love it do you hate it are you gonna buy it let us know in the comments down below while you're down there be sure to like subscribe and hit the Bell icon to be notified of when we upload next I'm Harlem around the sound guys and until next time happy listening foreign,"The Nothing Ear (2) takes an unconventional approach to true wireless earbuds with its Android and iOS friendly design. It features the LHDC and AAC codecs, alongside some luxuries like ANC and a comprehensive app. Despite having some considerate features like IP54 and IP55 ratings for the buds and case respectively, the app's generated personalized sound and ANC don't feel custom. Put in the leg work and the lightweight earbuds might just outdo the price tag."
Razer BlackShark V2, hey [Music] razer gaming headsets are typically known for their bulky designs led accented ear cups and a jet black finish that just screams gamer now with the black shark v2 razer has done away with all of that delivering a gaming headset that shows a level of restraint that we don't normally see from the company the ear cups are smaller with a matte black finish and razer logos that don't take up much room on the sides this is a pretty low key gaming headset which is perfect for anyone who wants to use it outside of gaming such as for conference calls the build quality on this headset is fantastic sporting a sturdy metal construction i did find however that the wireframe hinges felt a little flimsy and i felt like i had to be extra careful when adjusting the headband it's a little inconvenient but definitely not a deal breaker when it comes to comfort however wow the black shark v2 is by far one of the most comfortable headsets we've tested here at sound guys it's even more comfortable than some regular headphones like the audio technica ath m40x and the bose qc35 mark ii this is largely thanks to the ear pads which are made of a memory foam wrapped in layers of leatherette and mesh fabric now coupled with the soft cushion headband and this headset feels extremely comfortable it's almost as if there's nothing on your head it's so lightweight and so soft it's going to be ideal for long gaming periods or for just casual listening throughout the day on the left hand ear cup you're going to find a hardware volume knob which has just enough resistance that a slight bump isn't going to accidentally crank up the volume and destroy your eardrums on the left ear cup you'll also find a microphone which is detachable and this is really convenient when you just want to use the headset for listening to music or to watch a movie using the black shark v2 is very straightforward the headset supports 3.5 millimeter connections which makes it compatible with virtually any gaming console and for pc gamers the included usb dongle allows you to control the headset through razer synapse 3 giving you access to features such as eq controls thx spatial audio and thx tuned sound profiles for games like apex legends and more as far as device management apps go razer synapse 3 is it's just okay it's a little clunky takes some getting used to but once you find your way around it gets the job done now if you're on a mac like me you unfortunately don't have access to these features because razer has yet to support synapse 3 on mac os and it's been 3 years since synapse 3 came out i'm still waiting razor now i'm personally not much of a gamer but our resident gaming expert sam was able to put the black shark v2 to the test with some gameplay gaming with the black shark v2 is an absolute treat especially when you consider just how comfortable the headset is during long periods whether you're playing on a playstation xbox nintendo switch or whatever console you want it just works there's no dongle no crazy setup required it's just plug and play for pc gamers you have access to thx spatial audio which reproduces sound in 3d space using advanced processing of location tone loudness and pitch now this is different from virtual 7.1 surround sound which creates the illusion of space just by panning audio between the left and right channels with spatial audio enabled multiplayer games like overwatch and halo 3 sound great and the black shark v2 really helped sam with this spatial awareness as he was able to identify directional cues like footsteps and gunshots though it hardly made him better at any of the games when it comes to sound quality the razer black shark v2 is one of the most accurate headsets we've tested and it really exceeded our expectations considering its sub 100 price tag with its large 50 millimeter drivers there's a slight emphasis on the low end which is typical of most gaming headsets and it's also ideal for people who are a fan of hip hop and electronic music there is a slight de-emphasis between the three to six kilohertz range and this may lead to some duller sounding acoustic guitars and snare drums however the mids are surprisingly balanced for a gaming headset even more so than something like the audio technica ath m50xbt this relatively balanced sound signature makes this headset great not just for gaming and general content consumption but even for basic video editing the sound from the blackshark v2 is not prograde and it is not meant to be but it blows pretty much any other budget gaming headset out of the water now according to razer the black shark v2 features advanced passive noise cancellation and as a team of audio experts we have to say this that's just isolation and no matter what you call it no matter what fancy terminology you use alongside it it doesn't change the fact that it is just physics it is just isolation but marketing gimmicks aside we have to hand it to razer the black shark v2 features arguably the best isolation we have seen from a gaming headset the headset does a great job attenuating mid to high frequencies blocking out conversations and general ambient noise in fact according to our tests the black shark v2 outperforms even razer's own active noise cancelling headphones the razer opus and that costs a hundred dollars more the black shark v2 is not the best when it comes to attenuating lower frequencies which is expected when you're not using active noise cancelling still when it comes to isolation you'd be hard-pressed to find a better gaming headset than the blackshark v2 [Music] at less than a hundred dollars the blackjack v2 is bound to compromise somewhere and unfortunately in this case it's with the microphone now the microphone on the black shark v2 isn't great and like with most gaming headsets there's a significant de-emphasis in the low end while there is a slight over emphasis in higher frequencies while this helps your voice sound more intelligible in game with sibilant sounds coming through clearer this isn't going to help people with deeper voices who may end up sounding distorted and less present to give razer some credit the cardioid pickup pattern of this microphone is very helpful in filtering out unwanted ambient noise such as the fan which is located off to my left so you're seeing me right now from the flip side of my camera which is uh behind me and you are hearing my voice coming through the internal mic of the 2018 macbook pro 15 inch model now as you can probably tell the audio quality of the razer black shark v2 is probably gonna fare better than your own laptop's internal mic and as you can hear from this audio unwanted ambient noise such as the fan which is off to my side it can get just quite distracting for people when you're communicating in-game or even in a conference call and for comparison here is my voice coming through a more expensive microphone in this case i have the elgato wave 3 which runs for about 160 us dollars now the black truck v2 is never going to sound as good as this but it's just fine if you're otherwise stuck with your laptop's built-in mic [Music] now for the big question should you buy the razer black shark v2 if you couldn't already tell absolutely buy it it strikes the perfect balance between design comfort audio quality and usability even budget gaming headsets like the hyperx cloud alpha are going to have a hard time swimming with the blackshark v2 and if you can forgive its subpar microphone quality and are willing to cope with synapse 3 then the black shark v2 is one of the best headsets you can buy [Music],"The Razer BlackShark V2 is among the best gaming headsets on the market, in its price range or not. It's got better isolation than some noise canceling headphones, more accurate sound most gaming headsets, and it's comfortable enough to wear for hours without overheating—what more could you want?"
Microsoft Surface Headphones 2, [Music] so [Music] so the original microsoft surface headphones were aimed at the kings of active noise cancelling namely sony and bose and while those headphones were priced similarly they just couldn't hang now this is the surface headphones too and apart from being a hundred dollars cheaper they're also upgraded in a number of key ways that make them better than the originals but was that enough should you get them let's find out so just by looking at these headphones you probably wouldn't be able to tell them apart from the originals aside from the fact that they now come in black as well as the gray color option but they still have the same low key design the same minimal branding just the windows logo on the side and that's pretty much it they look more or less the same the ear cups do rotate completely around now which is nice so you can wear them around your neck when you're not using them and they also are pretty lightweight at just 295 grams which isn't the lightest pair of headphones that i've used but they're definitely not heavy at all and i was wearing these all day with no problem speaking of which these are super comfortable the plush ear pads just fit perfectly on my head and i'm able to wear them all day without any real ear fatigue my one complaint though is the padding on the headband i wish they used the same soft plush that's on the ear cups instead of this weird rubber material that always pulls on my hair so just like the originals the surface headphones too have touch sensitive ear cups so a double tap we'll skip to the next song a triple tap will return to a previous song and tapping it once will pause or play music now these work fine and i had really no issues with getting them to work the problem was they worked a little too well and i always accidentally ended up pausing or playing the music when i didn't mean to now this isn't a problem specific to these headphones this is a problem i have with pretty much all headphones that have touch sensitive playback controls but it's still kind of annoying one of my favorite features on these headphones are the rotating rings that control volume and noise cancelling so if you rotate the ring on the right ear cup you'll raise or lower the volume while rotating the ring on the left ear cup will adjust the strength of the noise cancelling so this is probably my favorite feature about these headphones because not only do they work perfectly when i want them to but turning the rings is just buttery smooth pairing to the headphones is also pretty easy if you download the surface audio app as it'll walk you through the entire process if you don't feel like doing that though you can just hold down the power button for five seconds and that'll enter bluetooth pairing mode or you can just connect the good old-fashioned audio cable because these do have a 3.5 millimeter input on top of that these headphones have also been upgraded into specs category as these now have bluetooth 5 and the appdex bluetooth codec now it's worth mentioning that if you're going to be using these with an ios device like i was for some of the testing you're not going to be able to take advantage of the aptx codec as iphone is only compatible with aac and since both devices need to be compatible with the same codecs they're just going to default down to sbc which is the standard audio codec that every bluetooth device uses [Music] now as far as bluetooth connection goes these were pretty great and i didn't have any skips or stutters in about a week of testing on top of that the multi-point functionality is probably the best i've used in any pair of headphones for example i was working on my computer listening to music i would pause my spotify i got up picked up my phone and walked away pressed plan a youtube video on my phone and it knew that the audio that i wanted to listen to was coming from my phone it's one of those features that just makes the headphones super convenient to use and it's probably very important to you if you use multiple devices throughout your day so the original surface headphones only had about 15 hours of constant playback which isn't great but microsoft claims that that's been upgraded with the surface headphones 2 to 20 hours of constant playback one weird thing worth mentioning though is that when you turn on the headphones a little voice prompt will tell you about how much time you have left and i was never able to get that to say 20 hours even when i had them charged up to a hundred percent it always said 17 hours for some reason not sure what's up with that but anyways i put these through our battery test which is just to play music at a constant output of 75 decibels with active noise canceling on full blast in our testing i got 17 hours and 47 minutes of constant playback which would explain the 17 hour prompt but unfortunately it didn't meet the claims that microsoft said of 20 hours still it is slightly better than the originals so microphone quality was also pretty good with these but as you can see from the graph there's a pretty consistent drop off below about 500 hertz lower notes in your voice won't come across as loud instead the microphone here focuses more on making your voice more intelligible to the person on the other side by emphasizing key frequencies so when it comes to noise canceling these have 13 different levels of adjustments all of which can be controlled with dial on the left ear cup but for the purposes of testing i kept it at max power if you look at the two graphs you can see that there's a significant difference between the regular passive isolation of the headphones which blocks out basically nothing under 100 hertz and the graph with the active noise cancelling turned on which shows a nice bump meaning that those particular frequencies are not as loud the louder the bump the more noise is cancelled the constant hum of an air conditioner or the noise you hear in the air cabin of a plane usually lands below a thousand hertz and these do a great job at cancelling that particular range out while they're not going to take the crown away from something like the sony wh-1000x mark 3s they're still really impressive so as i mentioned the strength of the active noise cancelling can be adjusted using the ring on the left ear cup but if you turn it all the way down you'll turn on passive mode meaning that you'll be able to hear what's going on around you so let's talk sound while you can turn on preset eqs in the app or even customize yourself if you want i left mine on the default option which is just flat now keep in mind that doesn't mean these headphones are actually perfectly flat it just means that it's not being tweaked by the app so as you can see from the graph the frequency response of these headphones is what i would call very consumer friendly meaning that there's a nice bump in the lows to make the bass notes more easier to hear in your favorite songs while also lowering the volume of certain frequencies that can cause harshness in the highs the result being that most people will probably love how these sound for some more added context executive editor chris thomas noticed that the frequency response graph for these looks very similar to another pair of popular headphones namely the audio technica ath m50x bts if you've ever used those or even the wildly popular wired version then you have a pretty good understanding of how these are going to sound in my usage though i found that there was a little more volume to the lows than i would normally like in the song home again by michael kiwanuka at around the 29 second mark you can hear his voice getting slightly masked by the bass notes that he's plucking on his guitar mids and highs on the other hand were my favorite part of these headphones the vocals in nikes by frank ocean just kind of float over the mid-tone heavy synths throughout the song and never approached harshness either overall these were very enjoyable to listen to and i'm sure most people will feel the same so should you get the surface headphones too well they do cost 250 dollars which isn't cheap by any means but it's a hundred dollars cheaper than some of the top active noise canceling headphones around plus they're a hundred dollars cheaper than the previous surface headphones so if it's a choice between these or the first gen model it's no competition you should definitely get the surface headphones too they have a high quality codec and aptx bluetooth 5 slightly better battery life and they cost a hundred dollars less so while we're talking about the price these are also less than the competition the sony wh-1000x mark iii is cost about 350 bucks and so do the bose nose canceling headphones 700 these undercut both of them and they have pretty good features that go toe to toe with both as well sure the sony sound better and have better active noise cancelling but the surface headphones too aren't bad in either of those categories either plus the surface headphones too have a way better bluetooth multipoint experience which i think is a way bigger deal than people think i have no problem recommending the surface headphones too because microsoft came to play,"The Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 is cheaper than many of the best consumer ANC headphones that Sony and Bose have to offer with features and specs that go toe-to-toe with them. Plus, this headset looks absolutely gorgeous. It has its drawbacks too: you can't disable ANC without enabling ambient passthrough, and the touchpads are easy to trigger by accident. Still, this is a great headset for conference calls."
Sony WH-CH710N, [Music] so besides pretty much anything having to do with true wireless headphones I would say the other question that I get asked the most is which noise cancelling headphones should I buy and for the longest time the answer is easy Bose just get the Bose but recently my answer has changed to the Sony WH 1000 X mark 3s which have better noise cancelling and I feel are just better for most people but those are also 350 bucks what if you have a hard budget of about 200 bucks well Sony's hoping that you'll reach for the new whch 710 and headphones which are also noise cancelling but only come in at $199 the question is should you pick them up so first things first these are way less expensive and obviously Tony had to cut some corners there in order to get the price down now where did they cut those corners well as you'd expect build quality unlike the Sony WH 1000 X Mark threes which are made of a smooth kind of soft glossy plastic these are made of a scratchy cheap failing plastic now this plastic amplifies sound a lot so if you're wearing the headphones and you scratch the outside of them accidentally you hear it it's like a megaphone right in your ear same goes for when you push the buttons if you're listening to music you'll hear the click in the headphones yeah there's no swipe gestures hear or touch capacitive sides like there aren't a Sony WH 1000 X Mark threes that's another thing that have to be cut in order to get the price down instead here you'll just get buttons now there is a bright spot though with these headphones and that's the padding which they might not look like much at first but they're super comfortable and I had no problem wearing these for hours at a time without feeling the pressure of the pain at the crown on my head like I normally do the headphones do fit pretty nicely when you put them on and they are pretty comfortable the problem is that I feel like the ear cups are a little too shallow and especially in my left ear I couldn't feel it pushing against the driver that's inside the ear cup that does get a little uncomfortable after a while and it's the only reason I found myself taking off these headphones every once in a blue just to give my left ear something like breathing time oh my god I do have big ears so your mileage may vary the biggest issue that I have with these though as far as build quality is concerned is that there are no hinges to fold them down the ear cups do rotate 90 degrees to lie flat which is nice but it's not as convenient as if you just had hinges and can fold it down to throw on your bag now as far as connection goes these are rocking Bluetooth 5.0 which is good the problem is that as far as bluetooth codecs are concerned these are only compatible with AAC which is weird considering that Sony makes L Dec that is their proprietary bluetooth codec for high quality streaming I'm not sure why it's missing here but you do get it in the WH 1000 X Mark threes so that's one thing to be aware of now besides that parents of these is pretty easy all you need to do is hold down the power button for a little bit longer once they turn on and they'll automatically enter pairing mode from there you can connect to your computer or iOS device if you have an Android device you can always just connect with NFC by holding the phone to the NFC logo on the side of the earcup the range on these is also pretty good I didn't have any stutters or issues at all when walking around my apartment now granted my apartment isn't huge but you know as long as you stay within a 30 40 foot range you should be fine and that was with a couple walls in the way I didn't have any skips or anything weird happening on top of that I didn't have any weird lip sync issues while watching videos which is good so if you watch a lot of YouTube videos or movies on your devices you won't have to feel like you're watching an old kung fu movie by using these then there's the playback controls which work pretty much as you'd expect there's volume controls there's multifunction button in the middle for playing applause music answering phone calls accessing your phone's assistant the works but there's another button on the side here that's a little bit more interesting this is a noise cancelling or the ambient sound button so first let's go over the ambient sound which uses microphones built into the headphones to let you hear what's going on around you and like I've said in previous videos I find this feature is super useful mainly because if you're on the subway or on a plane and you want to hear what the conductor is saying or the pilot then it's pretty easy just press the button you can hear through the headphones and hear what they're saying you won't miss the thing the problem with these is that there's a little voice that comes on and says ambient sound on or ambient sound off which kind of defeats the purpose it only takes like a second or two to play that notification but if you've ever taken the subway in New York City then you know that that second or two is the difference between getting off the next stop or being on an express train to Harlem now and now we can get to the active noise-cancelling because while it's not up to par with the sony WH 1000 X Mark threes it is pretty good here and I think it's gonna get the job done for most people they do a solid job at canceling out sounds under around 300 Hertz not to the extent of the wh 1000 X Mark threes as you can see from the graphs the higher bumps or the more blue or green you see means that more noise was cancelled so clearly the WH 1000 X mark threes do a better job all around these are still pretty respectable to the point that I don't think too many people will have massive problems while commuting or traveling it's one thing that's also pretty important when it comes to Bluetooth headphones is battery life and sony claims that these will give you 35 hours of constant playback now in our testing I'm currently at 18 hours and 6 minutes and we still haven't died yet so I'll let you know what the final number is make sure to check sound guys comm for the full review I'll update the numbers there but at the current time I think 18 hours is solid as hell plus if you ever find yourself long battery these do have quick charging so just plugging it in for 10 minutes will give you about 60 minutes of constant playback which isn't bad and these try to be a USBC thank God now while the microphone is good enough for phone calls it isn't gonna blow you away most of the vocal range isn't perfectly reproduced and there's a sharp drop off under about 200 Hertz which means that deeper notes in your voice won't come across as loud as others so I can use this to answer the phone or talk to your friends we wouldn't recommend it for conference calls or anything that requires better sound quality now when it comes to sound quality these do sound pretty good and I enjoyed my time using them but they're definitely not perfect as you can see from the frequency response graph these don't give a lot of emphasis to notes in the low end so bass heads are probably better off with something like the Sony WH xB 900 ends since those have a much stronger low end instead these have just a slight bump in the lows so the bass line that comes in at about 39 seconds into the song water bhairav rar I was still there but not overpowering any of the other frequencies just how I like it that said I felt like the mids were really lacking here for example in the same song I found at the vocals during the course we're definitely not as loud as I'm used to the climax of the song just fell a little flat because of that it could just be that I'm used to the more consumer-friendly sound of other headphones but I found vocals and a lot of my favorite songs to be underpowered and pretty underwhelming clarity in the highs was also not great and the cymbal hits and high send a song heaven in her eyes by Gabi ranks did nothing to enhance the feeling of space in the trek overall these headphones sound a little too flat for my liking but thankfully that makes them pretty easy to EQ yourself if you feel up to it so should you buy these if you want the best active noise-cancelling headphones around then no you shouldn't you should still get the sony WH 20000 X Mark threes or maybe wait for the mark fours when they come out the lack of L DAC support the cheaper build quality the worst sound quality the lack of gesture playback controls make these inferior to the WH 1000 X mark 3s in basically every way still if your budget is a hard $200 these will get the job done they have solid noise canceling solid battery life and they're pretty comfortable which is really all you want well these aren't must-haves by any means there's serious contenders for anyone with a hard limit of $200 if that sounds like you you should definitely check these out and that should pretty much do it for this one thanks for watching if you want to know more about these headphones or any of the other products review make sure to check out sound guys calm while you're here subscribe to the YouTube channel if you haven't already I'm Adam Alina happy listening,"For around $100 this is a great option for anyone that wants good active noise canceling but doesn't want to break the bank doing so. While it has plenty of flaws, it's still a solid pair of headphones overall that I would recommend to anyone with a hard budget. "
Google Pixel Buds (2020), [Music] so Google has finally entered the true wireless market with the new pixel buds or pixel buds - Jen - V - I don't know they're named after a product that already exists but I guess Google is kind of hoping we'll just all collectively forget that ever happened but I have to say they might have succeeded okay first let's go over the design because men are these pretty at least I think so my roommate not so much but I kind of like the Mentos like design I mean they're playful and googly and round but they're also pretty minimal and I really like that in my products and it reminds me a lot of something like the Opie one by teenage engineering which is probably one of my favorite design devices ever this thing I mean the pixel buds are definitely more round but right up my alley but let's get into the charging case because that's probably the most important part of a pair of two wireless earbuds it's the charging case that sets the good ones apart from the great ones I'm convinced that the minimal pocketable easy-to-use design of the first air pods charging case is what made them so successful and Google nailed that here these are just as small just as pocketable and just as easy to use so the lid opens up easily keeps the ear buds completely in place and then snaps shut magnetically and that click is great oh that's good the case is made of a soft white plastic that's smooth but not slippery and even though it did move around in my pockets a little bit more than I would have liked to I never found myself dropping these or losing my grip on them they're pretty grippy my biggest problem with the case so far is that the lid itself seems a little loose and flimsy and it makes a weird squeaky annoying sound that if it's really quiet and you're fidgeting with the case you can hear it it doesn't really impede functionality in any way it's just kind of annoying besides that though this case is pretty much perfect for everyday use and it's significantly better than the first gen pixel buds case it's like night and day so good job Google the other useful feature that I really liked about the case was that when you open them up there's two LED lights that show you the battery status of both the case itself and the earbuds if it's white it means that it's perfectly charged if it's orange that means that it's low on battery and you should probably plug it in now the earbuds themselves are made of the same soft plastic that the case is and our touch sensitive for controlling playback a single tap pauses or plays music double tapping will skip to the next song a triple tap will return to a previous song and then to adjust volume all you have to do is slide across now to put them on there is a specific way that you're supposed to do this you have to put them in and then twist to lock them in place to activate the Google assistant all you have to do is hold your finger on the ear button till you hear the noise that says it's okay to talk I found the assistant integration to be one of the best parts of this experience just walking around my apartment asking me questions and adjusting volume and playing songs and podcast was like seamless and I know that you can do that if you already have a phone but when my phone wasn't on me having this functionality came in handy more times than I thought it would now I'm not sure how useful that's gonna be once I'm back out in public again because I'm currently in quarantine but once I'm on the subway I don't know if I'm gonna be using it to adjust volume and things like that but at least it's there the earbuds also pretty slim and don't stick out too much like some other true wireless earbuds my one issue with these is comfort because they're not that comfortable for long listening periods these little soft of other parts here are stabilizers the problem is that after an hour or two they get really uncomfortable still these do a good job at stabilizing the ear but in keeping them in my ear which I'm sure is gonna come in handy on my runs because these are ipx4 sweat proof so you can't take them to the gym we're running so as far as connection goes these are rocking Bluetooth 5.0 and have the AAC Bluetooth codec which is kind of a bummer I mean I wasn't expecting l Dec since that's Sony but I would have at least like to see app 2x or something but nerd talk aside these can connect to both Android and iOS devices but you will get some cooler features if you're connected to Android for one it's the initial pairing process it's just made so much easier if you're on Android there's no shuffling through Bluetooth settings or anything like that all you have to do is flip the lid open X to your Android phone and a card will automatically pop up so you can pair to the headphones it's pretty much exactly like how the air pods work with iOS devices plus you'll also get a feature called adaptive sound which races are lower the volume of the music you're listening to based on the noise that's going on around you and while that is a neat trick I didn't find it that useful and I would have preferred something like active noise-cancelling or transparency mode like you'll find them to Sony WF 1000 X Mark threes but that probably would have made these more expensive so I won't complain so it's a pair to an iOS device or any other non Android device all you need to do is flip open the lid and hold down the button that's on the back of the charging case from there the earbuds will enter pairing mode and then you just have to go into Bluetooth settings and connect to them like any other Bluetooth device you won't get the Google assistant if you're on iOS and it doesn't even bring up Siri but it's fine who uses Syria anyway so as far as battery life goes google claims five hours of constant playback but in our testing with a constant output of 75 decibels we got six hours and eight minutes which is even better than what they claimed still it's not the best we've seen it's pretty average when you compare it to some of the better models like the Samsung Galaxy buds Plus which get twelve hours six hours is almost kind of laughable but it should be good for most situations the case will also give you another 24 hours of listening time and in quick charges - so just 10 minutes in the case will give the ear buds about two hours of listening which is really good that's not the only cool thing that case can do because not only does it charge via a USB C but the case itself is also compatible with any qi wireless chargers so just placing it down on the pad will start juicing up your buds juicing up your buds that sounds weird one other thing that's pretty cool is that if you're on Android you'll get a small little drop-down notification that will tell you the status of each earbud and a case but I did find this to be a little misleading because it showed that one earbud was discharging way quicker than the other one but when we did our battery testing they both died relatively close to each other within a minute or two so I'm not sure why the discrepancy on the notification but it really doesn't affect the functionality at all then there's the built-in microphone which is pretty damn good I mean it isn't perfectly flat as you can see and there are some bits of the vocal range that get a little extra emphasis but there isn't a super hard drop-off below a hundred Hertz like other mics so it preserves most of the important bits of a deep vocal range that's all the more impressive considering I can't see where the microphones are unlike the air pods Pro or the job related 75 T's which you can spot the microphones and just point them out sound quality wasn't the strongest point on the original picks but it's mainly because of their lack of isolation and that's more or less the case here but at least it isn't as bad as the original pixel buds isolation still isn't a strong point with the new pixel buds and they block basically nothing at the low end so if you're looking to bring these on an airplane this probably isn't the one for you since the roar of the engine will cut right through that said these buds sound really good though I should warn any base heads out there that this isn't gonna do it for you the bass response is pretty flat and if you can get a good seal by switching out the ear tips then you should be fine that is assuming you don't like overbearing bass well there was definitely a lack of sub bass in some songs I found that what I'm after in a pair of true wireless earbuds was there these did just enough to keep the kick drums and bass guitar and selfless by The Strokes subtle but present just like I like it now there is a small amount of emphasis in the mids and highs as well which maybes pretty good for listening to my podcasts while walking around the apartment I've been listening to a number of podcast thanks to quarantine and seeing as the range of 300 Hertz to about 3000 Hertz is where most formats necessary for speech intelligibility tend to lie I don't have a problem hearing the commentators over whatever else is happening in the apartment the one thing that still remains to be seen is how well these will hold up once I'm back outside and these have to compete with trucks in the subway highs are also emphasized but the end result here was a little bit different while I was able to clearly hear all the high hats and cymbals and the song feels like we only go backwards by tame impala they definitely were not as clear as I'm used to and at times things and the highs almost sounded like they were overlapping each other so the question is should you buy the pixel buds I mean I did while these aren't the best ear buds we've ever tested and $179 is not cheap Google nailed everything that's important when it comes to a pair of true wireless earbuds the charging case is damn near perfect and while the earbuds themselves aren't the most comfortable for longer listening sessions I'm willing to make that trade just because of how convenient they are I mean for most people I would probably still recommend the Jabra elite 75 TS whether you're on android or iOS but we all know someone with a pair of the original air pods that loved them and it wasn't because they sounded great I can tell you that because they were super convenient and easy to use the new pixel buds are the air pods of Android finally are they perfect absolutely not are they the best no they're not the best at any one thing they're good at a bunch of things but they're not the best at any one thing they're just really easy to use and they've earned a spot in my everyday carry and keeping these well I'm keeping these this one is the review unit see there's no sticker this one has a sticker this is the one I'm keeping I pay for these and that should pretty much do it for this one thanks for watching if you

Sony WF-1000XM3, [Music] so if you people watch as much as I do you begin to notice some patterns or trends and as someone who writes about audio I tend to notice what kind of headphones people are using first now lately there are two kinds of headphones that are absolutely dominating they are active noise-cancelling headphones and true wireless headphones and if you combine the two you get these the sony WF 1000 x mark threes now this isn't a full review because well we already have a full review of these on the site that sony actually read and asked us if we wanted to do more of a hands-on introduction to them which I do but these can do a lot more than just play your music and today we're gonna dig deep into everything that you need to know about the sony WF 1000 X Mark threes starting with the design the WUF 1000 x mark threes are pretty damn slick my first impression wasn't too positive when I saw them online but I feel like these are one of those things that look and feel better in person and I think that applies to the earbuds as well but they're still super comfortable and I had no problem wearing them for a while once I found the right sized ear tip to get these to stay in you can also connect them to two devices and switch between them depending on which one you want so if you're commuting and connect it to your phone once you get to your destination you could just switch to your computer the lid flips open nicely for reeling the ear buds which magnetically snap back into place super convenient Plus these workers advertise when it comes to Auto connecting and disconnecting one thing worth mentioning is that these don't have an IP rating so I definitely wouldn't recommend using them for the gym but to be fair they're not really meant for the gym these are for blocking out the outside world aka they're perfect for commuters the initial setup with your phone is fairly easy things to NFC if you're on Android but if that doesn't work or if you have an iOS device which basically only has NFC for Apple pay then you can still find them in the Bluetooth settings pretty easily so the earbuds come with illustrations showing you how to insert them into your ears but it's really not that hard I got do take them out of the case insert it vertically and then rotate locked into place pretty simple as soon as you do that you're pretty much good money but I'd still recommend downloading to Sony headphones Connect app just to really get the most out of these so you have to be connected to the headphones in order to properly access the app but once you do you can choose between EQ presets or you can customize one yourself if you're feeling adventurous I'm just gonna stick with off you can even customize the touch sensitive bits on the side of the earbuds so by default the left one will control ambient sound control and the right one will control playback now the ambient sound control is pretty cool because all you have to do is hold down the left ear bud and it will use the microphones to let you hear what's going on around you it's a pretty handy feature if you're on the subway and don't want to miss a train announcement if it's your first time connecting to the headphones they should automatically enter pairing mode when you take them out of the charging case puts a pair of second device all you have to do is put them on and hold down both earbuds simultaneously for seven seconds that will enter pairing mode again so you can add the second device probably my favorite feature though has to be something called ambient sound control where the headphones automatically adjust the level of active noise-cancelling depending on what's going on around you so if it hears a lot of loud noises like if you're on a subway or in a plane it will automatically pump up the noise canceling to max to completely block out anything around you if you're just sitting at your desk or standing still like I am now it will tone it down a bit and you'll be able to hear some of your ambient surroundings this is all thanks to Sony's qn1 II active noise-cancelling chip which is pretty cool but we'll talk more about the active noise-cancelling later as far as playback goes a single tap on the right earbud will pause your music while a double tap will skip to the next song and a triple tap returns to a previous song on the Left earbud a single tap will toggle either ambient sound control or the Google assistant if you have it set to ambient control mode you can just hold your finger on the left ear but in order to hear what's going on around you speaking of active noise-cancelling let's dig into it now while these aren't as good as the larger WH 1000 X Mark 3's just by the sheer nature of being earbuds and not well giant over ears these are still pretty good especially when you consider that these are true wireless earbuds and having active noise-cancelling inside them that's actually good keyword good is actually pretty unique and that's in no small part due to the qn1 each chip inside fair warning you do have to give the app permission to your location when you're setting this up but if you do it can sense when you're moving or standing still so while I'm just sitting at my desk that active noise-cancelling isn't as strong as when I'm riding on the subway or walking through the streets in the city it's a pretty useful feature that I've really enjoyed but there is a weird thing that happens when it switches between modes that causes your music to momentarily pause while it switches and it does get pretty annoying especially when you're on a stop-and-go subway ride on the bright side if you don't want to deal with this and you just want to go with active noise-cancelling 100% of the time you can easily just toggle that off in the app so this is the graph of how strong to active noise-cancelling is that we got from our full testing which you can read all about in a full review if you really want to basically the way to read this graph is that the higher the peak and the more blue or green you see the more noise is getting cancelled so more blue or green is better see this bump in the low end here even though it's pink it is a bump that's what you want to see because it means that the low-end rumbles of planes and trains will be blocked out even just ignoring true wireless earbuds plenty of headphones in general struggle with blocking out lower noises but these do a pretty good job so why is that important because of something called auditory masking this is what happens when two different sounds that have similar frequencies reach your ears at the same time whichever one is louder is usually the one that your brain decides to focus on ignoring the less intense sound if you're listening to a sweet bass guitar solo and then get on the subway the loud rumble of the train will almost certainly overpower your music this is why isolation is so important when it comes to headphones active noise-cancelling headphones take that a step further and actively remove some of those sounds letting you hear more of your music instead of the outside world which is why that hump in the graph from earlier is a good thing now the WUF 1000 X Mark threes are pretty great at active noise-cancelling but there's still earbuds which means we need to talk about how they sound and in short they sound great they have a slight emphasis in the low end which is helpful for helping you hear those lower knows and because of that auditory masking thing we spoke about earlier the low notes are the first to go which is why the slight low-end emphasis here combined with the active noise-cancelling really gets the job done these have the seh X processing built in which lends to some great sounding audio that you can jam out to while we're on the subject of jamming out we should probably talk about the battery we usually test headphones at a constant output of 75 decibels and the average tends to be around 3 to 4 hours for most true Wireless models in our testing of the WUF 1000 X Mark threes we got closer to 5 hours with 4 hours and 46 minutes of constant playback and that was with active noise-cancelling turned on to the max if you go into the app and turn it off sony says that you can squeeze another two hours of playback once they do die though just 10 minutes in the charging case will give you about one and a half hours of playback which is super handy and the charging case gives you another three full charges plus they charge via USB C which is great if you're like me and want one cable to charge everything now my phone my tablet my computer and my headphones can now charge with the same cable quick pro tip if you pick these up make sure to update to the latest firmware immediately just so you can avoid any bugs and get the most out of the experience while these are far from cheap you likely won't be disappointed if you picked up a pair of these for yourself and we hope this video helped you understand your new buds just a little bit better if you don't have a pair of true wireless earbuds yet then these are perfect if you like the idea of the larger active noise-cancelling WH 1000 x mark 3 headphones but don't want the hassle of carrying around a huge pair of overviews these earbuds fit right in your pocket and fill that niche perfectly so if you do decide to pick up a pair and have any questions just come back and watch this video again,"Wireless earbuds are a dime a dozen, and the Sony WF-1000XM3 makes it easy to justify the cost. The design and comfort are good, and the connection strength is consistent. While the lack of aptX or LDAC support is a big drawback, DSEE HX processing improves low-quality audio files. If you want stylish active noise canceling (ANC) earbuds, the WF-1000XM3 needs to be at the top of your list."
Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700," [Music] if you've been on a plane in the past couple of years I guarantee that you've seen some Bose headphones around because they've been the king of active noise-cancelling at least until the sony WH 20,000 x mark twos came out and the newer Mark threes for the past maybe year or two the Sony's have pretty much dominated the active noise-cancelling conversation but now Bose finally has their answer the bose noise-canceling headphones 700 terrible name but whatever are these the ones that we've been waiting for let's find out the first thing that's pretty obvious is that these are a complete redesign besides the color options they look almost nothing like the QC 35 s before them and I kind of love it the new minimal design ditched the folding hinges which kind of sucks but instead you get a sturdy stainless steel band instead of the plastic and it just feels less likely to snap on you the ear cups still rotate 90 degrees so that's good but the whole look and feel is just simpler and looks objectively gorgeous the Sony WH 1000 X mark 3s and even the bose qc25 s aren't old but they look ancient next to this new sleek design while the design may look like it's from the future the tech is definitely Bose playing catch up these ditch the playback controls in favor of a touch sensitive pad on the right ear cups similar to that of the Sony WH 1000 X Mark threes and these work just as nicely just swipe forward and back to skip between songs and up and down to adjust volume and one thing that I really like is the DoubleTap to play or pause functionality with touch pads that only use a single tap to pause or play I find myself accidentally pausing music constantly and it gets really annoying by making it a DoubleTap Bose pretty much ensured that these won't misfire on they also now have USB C charging which is basically mandatory in 2019 but it's not all rainbows and butterflies there are some things that I don't like and one in particular that I feel like is a step backwards which is that these don't fold and I know I mentioned that already but that's kind of a big bummer especially if you're a commuter like me another thing that I don't like is that while these aren't uncle by any means they're easily not as comfortable as the bose qc25 s by a longshot the microfiber padding on the headband of the QC 35 s has been replaced with a soft rubberized one that adds just slightly more pressure at the crown of the head it also pulls up my hair sometimes which is annoying though it's definitely not as bad as the rubber padding on the beats headphones so that's a plus the ear cups also fit slightly more snug than the QC 35 s which is great for isolating outside noise but also makes them warmer than I'd like when wearing them especially now that it's summer here in the States don't get me wrong these are still really comfortable but they're just not as comfortable as the QC 35 s which were like pills for your ears so these are rockin bluetooth 5.0 and I had zero issues with skips or stutters during my time testing now while these do have a strong connection anywhere within around 30 feet I was a little disappointed that Bose is sticking with just the SBC and AAC codecs so no app X no L dak no apps x HD none of that and if all of this just sounds like a bunch of made-up letters to you make sure to check out our Bluetooth codec explainer which I'll link down below pairing to the headphones is simple and if you own an Android phone like I do the Google assistant drop-down lets you pair to them pretty quickly without needing to touch any of the Bluetooth settings then you can set up the Google assistant as well but to get the most out of these you're gonna want to download the Bose music app which is surprisingly smooth and well designed considering it's a headphone app since they're usually terrible in the app you can control exactly how much active noise-cancelling you want with the strengths ranging from 1 to 10 plus the button on the left ear cup lets you switch between presets which you can also set here in the app you can also rename these headphones to whatever you like you can also swap the phone assistant if Google isn't really your thing you can choose between Alexa the Google assistant and Siri if you're on an iOS device all of which can be pulled up in a pinch by pressing the custom button on the right ear cup these also do a good job at connecting to two devices at once and switching between them depending on which is playing audio but if they do get a little confused you can just choose which source device you want to connect to in the app which is pretty handy so Bose claims that the 700 headphones will give you about 20 hours of constant playback and in our testing that was pretty spot-on we got exactly 21 hours and 25 minutes which isn't as much as the Sony WH 1000 X Mark 3s or the newer wh xb9 hundred ends seriously what is it with these headphone names but still 21 hours is not bad at all plus you can set an auto timer in the app so that if you're not playing music for a certain amount of time five ten twenty minutes the headphones will automatically turn off which should save you some battery life so if you're watching this you probably mostly care about the active noise-cancelling are these actually better than the sony WH 1000 X Mark threes well first I'm gonna play two sample clips so you can hear them for yourself and then I'll come back in and I'll explain it in a little more detail noise cancellation zero turn ambient sound ambient sound control on noise canceling ambient sound while the bowls 700 headphones are fantastic noise counsellors and give you a finer amount of control when it comes to how much ambient sound you hear the Sony WH 1000 X Mark threes still do a slightly better job all around if you compare the two isolation graphs you can see that while the bow 700 headphones are pretty damn great the Sony's just have a slight edge into low end where there are higher peaks with more blue and green color which equates to noise cancelled in the 100 to 1000 Hertz range which is where most of the ambient noise that you experiences if you care about call quality the microphone for voices is also pretty good though it does tend to drop off around 200 Hertz pretty sharply meaning that those with a bass voice won't come across as loud on the other end though the person that you're on the phone with still shouldn't have too much trouble hearing you you'll just sound a little weird so now we can talk about sound quality because even though the Bose 700 headphones don't have the highest quality streaming codecs they still sound pretty good and I actually like the way they sound more than the QC 35 s before them even though they still have a slight emphasis on the lower notes as you can see from the pink and the frequency response graph the emphasis is more evenly spread out over the notes that fallen though 110 Hertz range and below compare that to the QC 35 2 headphones which makes any note less than 50 Hertz drastically louder compared to the rest of the lows you can hear this nicely in the bass line throughout the song sedona by hound mouth which rumbles softly behind the vocals instead of overtaking them because of this vocals in the midst sound great and are never masked by what's going on in the low-end the slight dip around the 1 kilohertz mark isn't really as big an issue as it seems and in fact I find that the vocals tend to sound a little bit smoother thanks I'm not being overly emphasized for example the vocals throughout the song midnight blues by Umi or you mean you mean I'm not quite sure but they sound great and the highs are also handled nicely which you can hear from the bells playing behind her which never really get harsh so now the $400 question should you buy the Bose seven hundreds well technically the Sony WH 1000 X Mark threes still have better active noise-cancelling so that's all you care about then there's your answer but I think it's pretty clear that these are now the most desirable headphones on the market they still have great active noise-cancelling they have a good enough battery life and I think I've gushed over how much I like the design enough these also sound better than the QC 35 s and now have a touchpad for playback and USB C charging it's the spec and design upgrade that bose needed and i think they knocked it out of the park so obviously no one needs a $400 pair of headphones you don't have to go running out to throw these on a credit card there are plenty of great affordable options which I'll link down below like the audio technica ath ANC 7b s or these monoprice over ear headphones which both costs less than $100 and can get you like 75% of the way there but if you are in the market for a top-tier active noise-cancelling the bose 700 headphones are just freakin cool and that should pretty much do it for our review thanks for watching if you want to know more about the bose 700 headphones or any of the other products that we review make sure to check out sound guys calm while you're here subscribe to the YouTube channel if you haven't already and also check out our podcast which I'll link down below I feel like there's like 700 things on there but it's fine just click them all I'm Adam Alina happy listening","While the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 can't beat the Sony WH-1000XM4 at active noise canceling, they still does a great job. These cans are  exactly the upgrade that Bose needed to make, and their beautiful design and excellent sound quality will attract many music lovers."
Skullcandy Push Wireless, how's it going everyone I'm Adam Elena so Skullcandy doesn't exactly make top tier audio products in the same way that someone like Sennheiser might but that doesn't stop all of you guys from asking about them in the comments and for good reason the company does a pretty good job at making consumer focused products that become pretty popular just look at their crusher wireless headphones that we've recently reviewed over on the site they're not extremely well built and they don't have audiophile quality but they're a solid pair of cans that get the job done sticking with that theme we're looking at their newest product today the Skullcandy push true wireless earbuds there they are now this category is already full of crappy cheap Amazon products with only a handful of true contenders to the air pods so which category did the Skullcandy push true wireless earbuds fall into are they good or are they bad let's find out so if you were hoping for a beautiful premium feeling pair of earbuds these are gonna disappoint the charging case doesn't try to be anything other than just that a case what I mean by that is that there are no magnets to keep the case shut and make you feel all futuristic and cool instead they simply shut and require you to push in the small button to pop the lid open on the inside of the case there's a perfect cut out for each earbud which holds them nicely and it even magnetically snaps the earbuds into place which is super satisfying as well as conveniently unfortunately the case is also pretty big and bulky by true wireless earbuds standards in short this isn't a well-made case but it is definitely well designed it's more practical than it is sleek but at this price point that's exactly what I'm looking for plus it functions perfectly for what it's supposed to do it never opened accidentally and there's no fumbling around to get the ear buds to fit in the case properly now that your buds themselves are just as weird and my first impression of them was why but after wearing them for a day or two that became clear these fit amazingly well in my ears now the method of inserting them into your ears requires a bit of practice and it requires a small twist that helps the tiny wingtips lock these into place and while they might not be great at isolating outside noise they do a good enough job that I was able to work in peace at my local cafe with only occasional noises coming through like a loud laugh or the crash of plates each earbud also has a single large button on the side for playback controls for turning each one on or off individually if you need to do that for whatever reason but most important of all they stay in no matter what I do thanks to skull candies fit fin wingtips whether I was just doing the laundry walk into the local burrito spot to grab some lunch or going for a run to walk off said burrito these make a solid everyday companion worth mentioning is that skull candy says that these are water-resistant but they don't have an official IPX rating which is kind of a bummer so the Skullcandy push a rock and blue tooth 4.2 and in my few days of testing i didn't have a single skip when connected to my pixel three which is really impressive only when I was testing range that it's stutter and skip but that's kind of the point of the test even when watching videos there weren't any noticeable lag or lip sync issues somehow Skullcandy seems to have nailed one of the hardest things to get right the connection unfortunately they don't have any of the convenient auto connect features or the seamless switching between devices like you'll find on some WHU or h1 products but they are surprisingly on par with just general connectivity they also don't auto pause when you take them out of your ear but as I'm not a big fan of that feature to begin with I don't mind it playback controls all worked perfectly as well a single push of either button pauses or plays music while double taps on the right and left earbuds raise and lower the volume respectively then you can hold each one down for two seconds in order to skip between tracks and triple tap on either earbud to access the personal assistant of your device Skullcandy claims a battery life of six hours of constant playback which is great for true wireless earbuds and towards the upper end of products that we've tested we were able to get 6 hours and 21 minutes of constant playback at a constant output of 75 decibels so that's pretty much spot-on with what Skullcandy is claiming once you've run them dry you can just pop them back in the case which will give it one full charge before needing to be charged itself not great considering how big the cases but better than nothing I guess and the bright side these do charge via USB see so if you like me have been trying to use only one cable to charge all of your things then this is a great addition to your gear as far as sound quality is concerned the Skullcandy push aren't bad at all of course they do have the characteristic low in the bump that you'll find in the frequency response of pretty much any consumer headphones but it's not too overdone here and to be honest if I have our frequency response testing rig I wouldn't have really known the bass response is exactly what I look for in a pair of true wireless earbuds it isn't too overbearing where it takes over but it's just noticeable of course it isn't as precise as some higher-end pairs of canes and depending on the song there is still some masking of the mids that goes on but overall it's better than I was expected a good example of this isn't a song far nearby Jamie xx where the bass hits are there but some of the synths in the background can get a bit muffled it songs on the flipside I don't have a single complaint about the highs the finger-picking squeaks and scratches throughout the song dirty paws by Of Monsters and Men have just the right amount of detail without ever making the hairs on the back of your neck stand up so as far as microphone quality is concerned we can test that right now this is how it sounds with a soul King Plus as you can see from the chart that should be on the screen right now there is a slight drop off starting at around 200 hurt so if your voice is lower in frequency than mine is it won't come across his lap in the end I was really impressed with what this girl can you push offer it you can overlook the large bulky design of the buds or the large bulky charging case or the fact that said case only charges the earbuds once or the cheap plastic build of both the earbuds and the case for the clicky buttons that you hear right next to your eardrum then these get a lot of things right they have a great connection strength to my device have pretty good sound considering what they are and have one of the longest battery lives we've tested in a pair of true wireless earbuds most importantly for me though is that they fit amazingly well so while they might not be the sleekest or most prettiest of the true Wireless buds out there they're solid as hell which is becoming a bit of a pattern for Skullcandy and that does it for this review of the skull can you push wireless thanks for watching if you want to know more about these headphones or any of the other products review make sure to

JLab JBuds Air, just like electric scooters true wireless earbuds are all the rage and we're actually seeing an uptick in affordable ones now which is good because today we're talking about the J lab J buds err true Wireless sport earbuds these retail for just $49.99 and our ip55 certified so let's dig right into it and see if these are worthy of your ears ok so who's the target demographic here well we've got our athletes who will be happy with the ip55 dust and water resistance but that doesn't mean that we commuters and general consumers can't enjoy the earbuds - regardless of what has driven you to the J buds air we all get the same thing coming out of the box two pairs of cushions three pairs of ear tips a charging case and the ear buds the inner panel offers a cheat sheet of advanced controls which is helpful especially within the first few days of using them anyways onto the earbuds themselves I hope that you're fond of plastic because everything from the charging case that your bud housings are constructed from it now this is both good and bad because well it does make the product more affordable but it also cheapens the feel of it and some may see the size as a reason to avoid the ear buds altogether but what they lack in svelte style they make up for in functionality because they fit well with the cushions installed and remain stable while running cycling weightlifting and attempted tree climbing yeah that one hurt but that's not to say that they're comfortable for long periods of time because I normally can't wear them for more than an hour before having to take a break the charge in case provides an extra 10 hours of playback on top of our tested three point zero seven hour battery life not too shabby but one problem that I did have with the case has nothing to do with its 500 milliamp hour capacity but actually what's on at the bottom of it yes it's that exposed USB cable it's a smart design but concerning for long-term use playback controls are easy to operate and you can even make volume adjustments which is great plus clicking either earbud 3 times in succession let's use I go through the EQ presets which are signature balance and bass boosts and since these are well workout earbuds it's worth mentioning that they're great for working out again their water and dust resistance so they're durable and running outside is actually pretty delightful since their shape doesn't amplify wind noise connectivity is okay there were a few intermittent stutters but no more than one or two an hour now these don't support any high-quality bluetooth codecs like aptX or AAC so if you're going to be watching videos through the earbuds you're gonna experience some audio-visual lag it's annoying but not the end of the world if your primary intent is just for working out on the flipside the Auto Connect feature works without a hitch and as far as sound quality goes there about what you would expect after all these are cheap true wireless earbuds so you know they sound like it the emphasize base is great for keeping you pump during your routine but clarity and mid-range frequency production suffer and for the sake of consistency I kept the balance preset on while testing these earbuds just so I could refer to them but again you are gonna hear something different depending on what EQ preset you choose in pink by janelle monae the song opens with the synthesized bassline coupled with snapping and the low end is boosted by nature of the song although not terribly so from the get-go but anytime that Monay sings the word pink the ink or NK consonant sounds are masked by the bass and with youth performed by daughter the minor notes plucked from the guitar are difficult to hear above the drum hits during the chorus the fundamental frequencies are audible but the delicate harmonic resonance that we daughter fans have familiarized ourselves with our loss to the kick drum but at the end of the day should you buy them well yeah these are incredibly affordable Tru wireless earbuds and they do come with some drawbacks so yeah they're really bulky which is annoying for some but at least they only weigh six grams and yes there's audio-visual lag but most of us probably will only be using these for running or weightlifting or whatever kind of amazing athletic thing that you do so whatever not a huge deal I think my biggest gripe is actually with that USB cable on the bottom it's just weird how exposed it is I think it's a really good idea on the surface and if there was ever a time to try true wireless earbuds it's now after all the J buds err there are only $49 so you can easily explain to your partner why you don't want to take them on a date this week all right well that's been the sound guys review of the jlabbe J butts err true Wireless sport earbuds if you liked what you saw make sure to hit that like button down below and if you really liked it make sure to subscribe you can follow us on social media which is all laid out below me thanks for watching and until next time happy listening,"If you want a pair of one of the best cheap true wireless earbuds, the IP55-certified JLab JBuds Air is it.
